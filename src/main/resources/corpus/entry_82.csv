Abstract

We propose a method for combining two sources of astronomical data  spec-
troscopy and photometry  that carry information about sources of light (e.g.  stars 
galaxies  and quasars) at extremely different spectral resolutions. Our model treats
the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the radiation from a source as a latent
variable that jointly explains both photometric and spectroscopic observations.
We place a ﬂexible  nonparametric prior over the SED of a light source that ad-
mits a physically interpretable decomposition  and allows us to tractably perform
inference. We use our model to predict the distribution of the redshift of a quasar
from ﬁve-band (low spectral resolution) photometric data  the so called “photo-
z” problem. Our method shows that tools from machine learning and Bayesian
statistics allow us to leverage multiple resolutions of information to make accu-
rate predictions with well-characterized uncertainties.

Introduction

Enormous amounts of astronomical data are collected by a range of instruments at multiple spectral
resolutions  providing information about billions of sources of light in the observable universe [1 
10]. Among these data are measurements of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of sources of
light (e.g. stars  galaxies  and quasars). The SED describes the distribution of energy radiated by a
source over the spectrum of wavelengths or photon energy levels. SEDs are of interesting because
they convey information about a source’s physical properties  including type  chemical composition 
and redshift  which will be an estimand of interest in this work.
The SED can be thought of as a latent function of which we can only obtain noisy measurements.
Measurements of SEDs  however  are produced by instruments at widely varying spectral resolu-
tions – some instruments measure many wavelengths simultaneously (spectroscopy)  while others

average over large swaths of the energy spectrum and report a low dimensional summary (pho-
tometry). Spectroscopic data describe a source’s SED in ﬁner detail than broadband photometric
data. For example  the Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey [5] measures SED samples at
over four thousand wavelengths between 3 500 and 10 500 Å. In contrast  the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) [1] collects spectral information in only 5 broad spectral bins by using broadband
ﬁlters (called u  g  r  i  and z)  but at a much higher spatial resolution. Photometric preprocessing
models can then aggregate pixel information into ﬁve band-speciﬁc ﬂuxes and their uncertainties
[17]  reﬂecting the weighted average response over a large range of the wavelength spectrum. The
two methods of spectral information collection are graphically compared in Figure 1.
Despite carrying less spectral information  broadband photometry is more widely available and ex-
ists for a larger number of sources than spectroscopic measurements. This work develops a method
for inferring physical properties sources by jointly modeling spectroscopic and photometric data.
One use of our model is to measure the redshift of quasars for which we only have photometric ob-
servations. Redshift is a phenomenon in which the observed SED of a source of light is stretched to-
ward longer (redder) wavelengths. This effect is due to a combination of radial velocity with respect
to the observer and the expansion of the universe (termed cosmological redshift) [8  7]. Quasars  or
quasi-stellar radio sources  are extremely distant and energetic sources of electromagnetic radiation
that can exhibit high redshift [16]. Accurate estimates and uncertainties of redshift measurements
from photometry have the potential to guide the use of higher spectral resolution instruments to study
sources of interest. Furthermore  accurate photometric models can aid the automation of identifying
source types and estimating physical characteristics of faintly observed sources in large photometric
surveys [14].
To jointly describe both resolutions of data  we directly model a quasar’s latent SED and the process
by which it generates spectroscopic and photometric observations. Representing a quasar’s SED as
a latent random measure  we describe a Bayesian inference procedure to compute the marginal prob-
ability distribution of a quasar’s redshift given observed photometric ﬂuxes and their uncertainties.
The following section provides relevant application and statistical background. Section 3 describes
our probabilistic model of SEDs and broadband photometric measurements. Section 4 outlines
our MCMC-based inference method for efﬁciently computing statistics of the posterior distribu-
tion. Section 5 presents redshift and SED predictions from photometric measurements  among other
model summaries  and a quantitative comparison between our method and two existing “photo-z”.
We conclude with a discussion of directions for future work.

2 Background

The SEDs of most stars are roughly approximated by Planck’s law for black body radiators and
stellar atmosphere models [6]. Quasars  on the other hand  have complicated SEDs characterized by
some salient features  such as the Lyman-α forest  which is the absorption of light at many wave-
lengths from neutral hydrogen gas between the earth and the quasar [19]. One of the most interesting
properties of quasars (and galaxies) conveyed by the SED is redshift  which gives us insight into an
object’s distance and age. Redshift affects our observation of SEDs by “stretching” the wavelengths 
λ ∈ Λ  of the quasar’s rest frame SED  skewing toward longer (redder) wavelengths. Denoting the

3 Model

This section describes our probabilistic model of spectroscopic and photometric observations.
Spectroscopic ﬂux model The SED of a quasar is a non-negative function f : Λ → R+  where Λ
denotes the range of wavelengths and R+ are non-negative real numbers representing ﬂux density.
Our model speciﬁes a quasar’s rest frame SED as a latent random function. Quasar SEDs are highly
structured  and we model this structure by imposing the assumption that each SED is a convex
mixture of K latent  positive basis functions. The model assumes there are a small number (K) of
latent features or characteristics and that each quasar can be described by a short vector of mixing
weights over these features.
We place a normalized log-Gaussian process prior on each of these basis functions (described in
supplementary material). The generative procedure for quasar spectra begins with a shared basis

βk(·)

iid∼ GP(0  Kθ)  k = 1  . . .   K 

wn ∼ p(w)   s.t. (cid:88)

where Kθ is the kernel and Bk is the exponentiated and normalized version of βk. For each quasar n

one  the latent normalized SED is then constructed as

Photometric ﬂux model
Photometric data summarize the amount of energy observed over a
large swath of the wavelength spectrum. Roughly  a photometric ﬂux measures (proportionally) the
number of photons recorded by the instrument over the duration of an exposure  ﬁltered by a band-
speciﬁc sensitivity curve. We express ﬂux in nanomaggies [15]. Photometric ﬂuxes and measure-
ment error derived from broadband imagery have been computed directly from pixels [17]. For each
quasar n  SDSS photometric data are measured in ﬁve bands  b ∈ {u  g  r  i  z}  yielding a vector of
ﬁve ﬂux values and their variances  yn and τ 2
n b. Each band  b  measures photon observations at each
wavelength in proportion to a known ﬁlter sensitivity  Sb(λ). The ﬁlter sensitivities for the SDSS
ugriz bands are depicted in Figure 1  with an example observation frame quasar SED overlaid. The
actual measured ﬂuxes can be computed by integrating the full object’s spectrum  mn · f (obs)

SDSS bands are modeled as independent Gaussian random variables with known variance

Conditioned on the basis  B = {Bk}  we can represent f (rest)
with a low-dimensional vector. Note
that f (rest)
is a function of wn  zn  mn  and B (see Equation 4)  so we can think of µb as a function
of wn  zn  mn  and B. We overload notation  and re-write the conditional likelihood of photometric
observations as

yn b | wn  zn  mn  B ∼ N (µb(wn  zn  mn  B)  τ 2

(8)
Intuitively  what gives us statistical traction in inferring the posterior distribution over zn is the struc-
ture learned in the latent basis  B  and weights w  i.e.  the features that correspond to distinguishing
bumps and dips in the SED.
Note on priors For photometric weight and redshift inference  we use a ﬂat prior on zn ∈ [0  8] 
and empirically derived priors for mn and wn  from the sample of spectroscopically measured
sources. Choice of priors is described in the supplementary material.

Inference

Basis estimation For computational tractability  we ﬁrst compute a maximum a posteriori (MAP)
estimate of the basis  Bmap to condition on. Using the spectroscopic data  {xn λ  σ2
n λ  zn}  we com-
pute a discretized MAP estimate of {Bk} by directly optimizing the unnormalized (log) posterior
implied by the likelihood in Equation 5  the GP prior over B  and diffuse priors over wn and mn 

p(cid:0){wn  mn} {Bk}|{xn λ  σ2

n λ  zn}(cid:1) ∝ N(cid:89)

p(xn λ|zn  wn  mn {Bk})p({Bk})p(wn)p(mn) .
(9)

n=1

We use gradient descent with momentum and LBFGS [12] directly on the parameters βk  ωn k  and
log(mn) for the Nspec spectroscopically measured quasars. Gradients were automatically computed
using autograd [9]. Following [18]  we ﬁrst resample the observed spectra into a common rest
frame grid  λ0 = (λ0 1  . . .   λ0 V )  easing computation of the likelihood. We note that although our
model places a full distribution over Bk  efﬁciently integrating out those parameters is left for future
work.

Sampling wn  mn  and zn The Bayesian “photo-z” task requires that we compute posterior
marginal distributions of z  integrating out w  and m. To compute these distributions  we con-
struct a Markov chain over the state space including z  w  and m that leaves the target posterior
distribution invariant. We treat the inference problem for each photometrically measured quasar 
yn  independently. Conditioned on a basis Bk  k = 1  . . .   K  our goal is to draw posterior samples
of wn  mn and zn for each n. The unnormalized posterior can be expressed

(λ)dλ and Sb(λ). Because the observation yn
can often be well explained by various redshifts and weight settings  the resulting marginal poste-
rior  p(zn|X  yn  B)  is often multi-modal  with regions of near zero probability between modes.
Intuitively  this is due to the information loss in the SED-to-photometric ﬂux integration step.
This multi-modal property is problematic for many standard MCMC techniques. Single chain
MCMC methods have to jump between modes or travel through a region of near-zero probabil-
ity  resulting in slow mixing. To combat this effect  we use parallel tempering [4]  a method that is
well-suited to constructing Markov chains on multi-modal distributions. Parallel tempering instan-
tiates C independent chains  each sampling from the target distribution raised to an inverse temper-
ature. Given a target distribution  π(x)  the constructed chains sample πc(x) ∝ π(x)1/Tc  where Tc
controls how “hot” (i.e.  how close to uniform) each chain is. At each iteration  swaps between
chains are proposed and accepted with a standard Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability

Pr(accept swap c  c(cid:48)) =

πc(xc(cid:48))πc(cid:48)(xc)
πc(xc)πc(cid:48)(xc(cid:48))

.

(11)

Within each chain  we use component-wise slice sampling [11] to generate samples that leave each
chain’s distribution invariant. Slice-sampling is a (relatively) tuning-free MCMC method  a conve-
nient property when sampling from thousands of independent posteriors. We found parallel tem-
pering to be essential for convincing posterior simulations. MCMC diagnostics and comparisons to
single-chain samplers are available in the supplemental material.

5 Experiments and Results

We conduct three experiments to test our model  where each experiment measures redshift predictive
accuracy for a different train/test split of spectroscopically measured quasars from the DR10QSO
dataset [13] with conﬁrmed redshifts in the range z ∈ (.01  5.85). Our experiments split train/test
in the following ways: (i) randomly  (ii) by r-band ﬂuxes  (iii) by redshift values. In split (ii)  we
train on the brightest 90% of quasars  and test on a subset of the remaining. Split (iii) takes the
lowest 85% of quasars as training data  and a subset of the brightest 15% as test cases. Splits (ii)

and (iii) are intended to test the method’s robustness to different training and testing distributions 
mimicking the discovery of fainter and farther sources. For each split  we ﬁnd a MAP estimate of the
basis  B1  . . .   BK  and weights  wn to use as a prior for photometric inference. For computational
purposes  we limit our training sample to a random subsample of 2 000 quasars. The following
sections outline the resulting model ﬁt and inferred SEDs and redshifts.

Basis validation We examined multiple choices of K using out of sample likelihood on a valida-
tion set. In the following experiments we set K = 4  which balances generalizability and computa-
tional tradeoffs. Discussion of this validation is provided in the supplementary material.

SED Basis We depict a MAP estimate of B1  . . .   BK in Figure 4. Our basis decomposition
enjoys the beneﬁt of physical interpretability due to our density-estimate formulation of the problem.
Basis B4 places mass on the Lyman-α peak around 1 216 Å  allowing the model to capture the co-
occurrence of more peaked SEDs with a bump around 1 550 Å. Basis B1 captures the H-α emission
line at around 6 500 Å. Because of the ﬂexible nonparametric priors on Bk our model is able to
automatically learn these features from data. The positivity of the basis and weights distinguishes
our model from PCA-based methods  which sacriﬁce physical interpretability.

Photometric measurements For each test quasar  we construct an 8-chain parallel tempering sam-
pler and run for 8 000 iterations  and discard the ﬁrst 4 000 samples as burn-in. Given posterior sam-
ples of zn  we take the posterior mean as a point estimate. Figure 5 compares the posterior mean to
spectroscopic measurements (for three different data-split experiments)  where the gray lines denote
posterior sample quantiles. In general there is a strong correspondence between spectroscopically
measured redshift and our posterior estimate. In cases where the posterior mean is off  our distri-
bution often covers the spectroscopically conﬁrmed value with probability mass. This is clear upon
inspection of posterior marginal distributions that exhibit extreme multi-modal behavior. To combat
this multi-modality  it is necessary to inject the model with more information to eliminate plausible
hypotheses; this information could come from another measurement (e.g.  a new photometric band) 
or from structured prior knowledge over the relationship between zn  wn  and mn. Our method
simply ﬁts a mixture of Gaussians to the spectroscopically measured wn  mn sample to formulate
a prior distribution. However  incorporating dependencies between zn  wn and mn  similar to the
XDQSOz technique  will be incorporated in future work.

5.1 Comparisons

We compare the performance of our redshift estimator with two recent photometric redshift estima-
tors  XDQSOz [2] and a neural network [3]. The method in [2] is a conditional density estimator
that discretizes the range of one ﬂux band (the i-band) and ﬁts a mixture of Gaussians to the joint
distribution over the remaining ﬂuxes and redshifts. One disadvantage to this approach is there there

is no physical signiﬁcance to the mixture of Gaussians  and no model of the latent SED. Further-
more  the original method trains and tests the model on a pre-speciﬁed range of i-magnitudes  which
is problematic when predicting redshifts on much brighter or dimmer stars. The regression approach
from [3] employs a neural network with two hidden layers  and the SDSS ﬂuxes as inputs. More
features (e.g.  more photometric bands) can be incorporated into all models  but we limit our exper-
iments to the ﬁve SDSS bands for the sake of comparison. Further detail on these two methods and
a broader review of “photo-z” approaches are available in the supplementary material.

Average error and test distribution We compute mean absolute error (MAE)  mean absolute
percentage error (MAPE)  and root mean square error (RMSE) to measure predictive performance.
Table 1 compares prediction errors for the three different approaches (XD  NN  Spec). Our ex-
periments show that accurate redshift measurements are attainable even when the distribution of
training set is different from test set by directly modeling the SED itself. Our method dramatically
outperforms [2] and [3] in split (iii)  particularly for very high redshift ﬂuxes. We also note that
our training set is derived from only 2 000 examples  whereas the training set for XDQSOz and the
neural network were ≈ 80 000 quasars and 50 000 quasars  respectively. This shortcoming can be
overcome with more sophisticated inference techniques for the non-negative basis. Despite this  the

SED-based predictions are comparable. Additionally  because we are directly modeling the latent
SED  our method admits a posterior estimate of the entire SED. Figure 6 displays posterior SED
samples and their corresponding redshift marginals for test-set quasars inferred from only SDSS
photometric measurements.

6 Discussion

We have presented a generative model of two sources of information at very different spectral res-
olutions to form an estimate of the latent spectral energy distribution of quasars. We also described
an efﬁcient MCMC-based inference algorithm for computing posterior statistics given photometric
observations. Our model accurately predicts and characterizes uncertainty about redshifts from only
photometric observations and a small number of separate spectroscopic examples. Moreover  we
showed that we can make reasonable estimates of the unobserved SED itself  from which we can
make inferences about other physical properties informed by the full SED.
We see multiple avenues of future work. Firstly  we can extend the model of SEDs to incorporate
more expert knowledge. One such augmentation would include a ﬁxed collection of features  cu-
rated by an expert  corresponding to physical properties already known about a class of sources.
Furthermore  we can also extend our model to directly incorporate photometric pixel observations 
as opposed to preprocessed ﬂux measurements. Secondly  we note that our method is more more
computationally burdensome than XDQSOz and the neural network approach. Another avenue of
future work is to ﬁnd accurate approximations of these posterior distributions that are cheaper to
compute. Lastly  we can extend our methodology to galaxies  whose SEDs can be quite compli-
cated. Galaxy observations have spatial extent  complicating their SEDs. The combination of SED
and spatial appearance modeling and computationally efﬁcient inference procedures is a promising
route toward the automatic characterization of millions of sources from the enormous amounts of
data available in massive photometric surveys.
