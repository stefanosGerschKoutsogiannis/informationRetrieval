Abstract

Reconstruction of neuroanatomy is a fundamental problem in neuroscience.
Stochastic expression of colors in individual cells is a promising tool  although its
use in the nervous system has been limited due to various sources of variability in
expression. Moreover  the intermingled anatomy of neuronal trees is challenging
for existing segmentation algorithms. Here  we propose a method to automate the
segmentation of neurons in such (potentially pseudo-colored) images. The method
uses spatio-color relations between the voxels  generates supervoxels to reduce
the problem size by four orders of magnitude before the ﬁnal segmentation  and is
parallelizable over the supervoxels. To quantify performance and gain insight  we
generate simulated images  where the noise level and characteristics  the density
of expression  and the number of ﬂuorophore types are variable. We also present
segmentations of real Brainbow images of the mouse hippocampus  which reveal
many of the dendritic segments.

Introduction

1
Studying the anatomy of individual neurons and the circuits they form is a classical approach
to understanding how nervous systems function since Ramón y Cajal’s founding work. Despite
a century of research  the problem remains open due to a lack of technological tools: mapping
neuronal structures requires a large ﬁeld of view  a high resolution  a robust labeling technique  and
computational methods to sort the data. Stochastic labeling methods have been developed to endow
individual neurons with color tags [1  2]. This approach to neural circuit mapping can utilize the
light microscope  provides a high-throughput and the potential to monitor the circuits over time  and
complements the dense  small scale connectomic studies using electron microscopy [3] with its large
ﬁeld-of-view. However  its use has been limited due to its reliance on manual segmentation.
The initial stochastic  spectral labeling (Brainbow) method had a number of limitations for neuro-
science applications including incomplete ﬁlling of neuronal arbors  disproportionate expression
of the nonrecombined ﬂuorescent proteins in the transgene  suboptimal ﬂuorescence intensity  and
color shift during imaging. Many of these limitations have since improved [4] and developments

in various aspects of light microscopy provide further opportunities [5  6  7  8]. Moreover  recent
approaches promise a dramatic increase in the number of (pseudo) color sources [9  10  11]. Taken
together  these advances have made light microscopy a much more powerful tool for neuroanatomy
and connectomics. However  existing automated segmentation methods are inadequate due to the
spatio-color nature of the problem  the size of the images  and the complicated anatomy of neuronal
arbors. Scalable methods that take into account the high-dimensional nature of the problem are
needed.
Here  we propose a series of operations to segment 3-D images of stochastically tagged nervous
tissues. Fundamentally  the computational problem arises due to insufﬁcient color consistency within
individual cells  and the voxels occupied by more than one neuron. We denoise the image stack
through collaborative ﬁltering [12]  and obtain a supervoxel representation that reduces the problem
size by four orders of magnitude. We consider the segmentation of neurons as a graph segmentation
problem [13]  where the nodes are the supervoxels. Spatial discontinuities and color inhomogeneities
within segmented neurons are penalized using this graph representation. While we concentrate on
neuron segmentation in this paper  our method should be equally applicable to the segmentation of
other cell classes such as glia.
To study various aspects of stochastic multispectral labeling  we present a basic simulation algorithm
that starts from actual single neuron reconstructions. We apply our method on such simulated images
of retinal ganglion cells  and on two different real Brainbow images of hippocampal neurons  where
one dataset is obtained by expansion microscopy [5].
2 Methods
Successful segmentations of color-coded neural images should consider both the connected nature
of neuronal anatomy and the color consistency of the Brainbow construct. However  the size and
the noise level of the problem prohibit a voxel-level approach (Fig. 1). Methods that are popular in
hyperspectral imaging applications  such as nonnegative matrix factorization [14]  are not immediately
suitable either because the number of color channels are too few and it is not easy to model neuronal
anatomy within these frameworks. Therefore  we develop (i) a supervoxelization strategy  (ii)
explicitly deﬁne graph representations on the set of supervoxels  and (iii) design the edge weights to
capture the spatio-color relations (Fig. 2a).
2.1 Denoising the image stack
Voxel colors within a neurite can drift along the neurite  exhibit high frequency variations  and differ
between the membrane and the cytoplasm when the expressed ﬂuorescent protein is membrane-
binding (Fig. 1). Collaborative ﬁltering generates an extra dimension consisting of similar patches
within the stack  and applies ﬁltering in this extra dimension rather than the physical dimensions.
We use the BM4D denoiser [12] on individual channels of the datasets  assuming that the noise is
Gaussian. Figure 2 demonstrates that the boundaries are preserved in the denoised image.
2.2 Dimensionality reduction
We make two basic observations to reduce the size of the dataset: (i) Voxels expressing ﬂuorescent
proteins form the foreground  and the dark voxels form the much larger background in typical
Brainbow settings. (ii) The basic promise of Brainbow suggests that nearby voxels within a neurite
have very similar colors. Hence  after denoising  there must be many topologically connected voxel
sets that also have consistent colors.
The watershed transform [15] considers its input as a topographic map and identiﬁes regions associated
with local minima (“catchment basins” in a ﬂooding interpretation of the topographic map). It can
be considered as a minimum spanning forest algorithm  and obtained in linear time with respect
to the input size [16  17]. For an image volume V = V (x  y  z  c)  we propose to calculate the
topographical map T (disafﬁnity map) as

T (x  y  z) = max

t∈{x y z} max

c

|Gt(x  y  z  c)| 

(1)

where x  y  z denote the spatial coordinates  c denotes the color coordinate  and Gx  Gy  Gz denote
the spatial gradients of V (nearest neighbor differencing). That is  any edge with signiﬁcant deviation
in any color channel will correspond to a “mountain” in the topographic map. A ﬂooding parameter 
f  assigns the local minima of T to catchment basins  which partition V together with the boundary
voxels. We assign the boundaries to neighboring basins based on color proximity. The background is

the largest and darkest basin. We call the remaining objects supervoxels [18  19]. Let F denote the
binary image identifying all of the foreground voxels.
Objects without interior voxels (e.g.  single-voxel thick dendritic segments) may not be detected by
Eq. 1 (Supp. Fig. 1). We recover such “bridges” using a topology-preserving warping (in this case 
only shrinking is used.) of the thresholded image stack into F [20  21]:

B = W(Iθ  F ) 

(2)
where Iθ is binary and obtained by thresholding the intensity image at θ. W returns a binary image
B such that B has the same topology as Iθ and agrees with F as much as possible. Each connected
component of B ∧ ¯F (foreground of B and background of F ) is added to a neighboring supervoxel
based on color proximity  and discarded if no spatial neighbors exist (Supp. Text).
We ensure the color homogeneity within supervoxels by dividing non-homogeneous supervoxels (e.g. 
large color variation across voxels) into connected subcomponents based on color until the desired
homogeneity is achieved (Supp. Text). We summarize each supervoxel’s color by its mean color.
We apply local heuristics and spatio-color constraints iteratively to further reduce the data size and
demix overlapping neurons in voxel space (Fig. 2f g and Supp. Text). Supp. Text provides details on
the parallelization and complexity of these steps and the method in general.

2.3 Clustering the supervoxel set
We consider the supervoxels as the nodes of a graph and express their spatio-color similarities
through the existence (and the strength) of the edges connecting them  summarized by a highly
sparse adjacency matrix. Removing edges between supervoxels that aren’t spatio-color neighbors
avoids spurious links. However  this procedure also removes many genuine links due to high color
variability (Fig. 1). Moreover  it cannot identify disconnected segments of the same neuron (e.g.  due
to limited ﬁeld-of-view). Instead  we adjust the spatio-color neighborhoods based on the “reliability”
of the colors of the supervoxels. Let S denote the set of supervoxels in the dataset. We deﬁne
the sets of reliable and unreliable supervoxels as Sr = {s ∈ S : n(s) > ts  h(s) < td} and
Su = S \ Sr  respectively  where n(s) denotes the number of voxels in s  h(s) is a measure of the
color heterogeneity (e.g.  the maximum difference between intensities across all color channels)  ts
and td are the corresponding thresholds.
We describe a graph G = (V  E)  where V denotes the vertex set (supervoxels) and E = Es∪Ec∪E¯s
denotes the edges between them:

Es = {(ij) : δij < s  i (cid:54)= j}
Ec = {(ij) : si  sj ∈ Sr  dij < c  i (cid:54)= j}
E¯s = {(ij)  (ji) : si ∈ Su  (ij) /∈ Es  Oi(j) < kmin − Ki  i (cid:54)= j} 

(3)
where δij  dij are the spatial and color distances between si and sj  respectively. s and c are
the corresponding maximum distances. An unreliable supervoxel with too few spatial neighbors is
allowed to have up to kmin edges via proximity in color space. Here  Oi(j) is the order of supervoxel
sj in terms of the color distance from supervoxel si  and Ki is the number of s-spatial neighbors of
si. (Note the symmetric formulation in E¯s.) Then  we construct the adjacency matrix as

(ij) ∈ E

where α controls the decay in afﬁnity with respect to distance in color. We use k-d tree structures
to efﬁciently retrieve the color neighborhoods [22]. Here  the distance between two supervoxels is
minv∈V u∈U D(v  u)  where V and U are the voxel sets of the two supervoxels and D(v  u) is the
Euclidean distance between voxels v and u.
A classical way of partitioning graph nodes that are nonlinearly separable is by minimizing a function
(e.g.  the sum or the maximum) of the edge weights that are severed during the partitioning [23].
Here  we use the normalized cuts algorithm [24  13] with two simple modiﬁcations: the k-means step
is weighted by the sizes of the supervoxels and initialized by a few iterations of k-means clustering
of the supervoxel colors only (Supp. Text). The resulting clusters partition the image stack (together
with the background)  and represent a segmentation of the individual neurons within the image stack.
An estimate of the number of neurons can be obtained from a Dirichlet process mixture model [25].
While this estimate is often rough [26]  the segmentation accuracy appears resilient to imperfect
estimates (Fig. 4c).
2.4 Simulating Brainbow tissues
We create basic simulated Brainbow image stacks from volumetric reconstructions of single neurons
(Algorithm 1). For simplicity  we model the neuron color shifts by a Brownian noise component on
the tree  and the background intensity by a white Gaussian noise component (Supp. Text).
We quantify the segmentation quality of the voxels using the adjusted Rand index (ARI)  whose
maximum value is 1 (perfect agreement)  and expected value is 0 for random clusters [27]. (Supp.

3 Datasets
To simulate Brainbow image stacks  we used volumetric single neuron reconstructions of mouse
retinal ganglion cells in Algorithm 1. The dataset is obtained from previously published studies [28 
29]. Brieﬂy  the voxel size of the images is 0.4µ × 0.4µ × 0.5µ  and the ﬁeld of view of individual
stacks is 320µ × 320µ × 70µ or larger. We evaluate the effects of different conditions on a central
portion of the simulated image stack.
Both real datasets are images of the mouse hippocampal tissue. The ﬁrst dataset has 1020×1020×225
voxels (voxel size: 0.1× 0.1× 0.3µ3)  and the tissue was imaged at 4 different frequencies (channels).
The second dataset has 1080 × 1280 × 134 voxels with an effective voxel size of 70 × 70 × 40nm 
where the tissue was 4× linearly expanded [5]  and imaged at 3 different channels. The Brainbow
constructs were delivered virally  and approximately 5% of the neurons express a ﬂuorescence gene.

neuron’s arbor can occupy a signiﬁcant portion of the dynamic range in color with the state-of-the-
art Brainbow data. Fig. 1c-e show that collaborative denoising removes much of this noise while
preserving the edges  which is crucial for segmentation. Fig. 2b-e and h demonstrate a similar effect
on a larger scale with real and simulated Brainbow images.
Fig. 2 shows the raw and denoised versions of the 1020 × 1020 × 225 image  and a randomly chosen
subset of its supervoxels (one-third). The original set had 6.2 × 104 supervoxels  and the merging
routine decreased this number to 3.9 × 104. The individual supervoxels grew in size while avoiding
mergers with supervoxels of different neurons. This set of supervoxels  together with a (sparse)
spatial connectivity matrix  characterizes the image stack. Similar reductions are obtained for all the
real and simulated datasets.

the z-axis.) In this particular example  the number of neurons within the image is 9  σ1 = 0.04 
σ2 = 0.1  and the simulated tissue is imaged using 4 independent channels. Supp. Fig. 4 shows a
patch from a single slice to visualize the amount of noise. The segmentation has an adjusted Rand

voxels. (In some cases  the value based on all voxels is higher.) The ground truth image displays only

that many of these supervoxels are correctly clustered to preserve the connectivity of neuronal arbors.
There are two important mistakes in clusters 4 (merger) and 9 (spurious cluster). These are caused by
aggressive merging of supervoxels (Supp. Fig. 5)  and the segmentation quality improves with the
inclusion of an extra imaging channel and more conservative merging (Supp. Fig. 6). We plot the
performance of our method under different conditions in Fig. 4 (and Supp. Fig. 7). We set the noise
standard deviation to σ1 in the denoiser  and ignored the contribution of σ2. Increasing the number
of observation channels improves the segmentation performance. The clustering accuracy degrades
gradually with increasing neuron-color noise (σ1) in the reported range (Fig. 4b). The accuracy does
not seem to degrade when the cluster count is mildly overestimated  while it decays quickly when the
count is underestimated (Fig. 4c).
Fig. 5 displays the segmentation of the 1020 × 1020 × 225 image. While some mistakes can be
spotted by eye  most of the neurites can be identiﬁed and simple tracing tools can be used to obtain
ﬁnal skeletons/segmentations [30  31]. In particular  the identiﬁed clusters exhibit homogeneous
colors and dendritic pieces that either form connected components or miss small pieces that do not
preclude the use of those tracing tools. Some clusters appear empty while a few others seem to
comprise segments from more than one neuron  in line with the simulation image (Fig. 2.4).
Supp. Fig. 8 displays the segmentation of the 4× expanded  1080× 1280× 134 image. While the two
real datasets have different characteristics and voxel sizes  we used essentially the same parameters
for both of them throughout denoising  supervoxelization  merging  and clustering (Supp. Text).
Similar to Fig. 5  many of the processes can be identiﬁed easily. On the other hand  Supp. Fig. 8
appears more fragmented  which can be explained by the smaller number of color channels (Fig. 4).
5 Discussion
Tagging individual cells with (pseudo)colors stochastically is an important tool in biological sciences.
The versatility of genetic tools for tagging synapses or cell types and the large ﬁeld-of-view of light
microscopy positions multispectral labeling as a complementary approach to electron microscopy
based  small-scale  dense reconstructions [3]. However  its use in neuroscience has been limited due
to various sources of variability in expression. Here  we demonstrate that automated segmentation of
neurons in such image stacks is possible. Our approach considers both accuracy and scalability as
design goals.
The basic simulation proposed here (Algo. 1) captures the key aspects of the problem and may
guide the relevant genetics research. Yet  more detailed biophysical simulations represent a valuable
direction for future work. Our simulations suggest that the segmentation accuracy increases signiﬁ-
cantly with the inclusion of additional color channels  which coincides with ongoing experimental
efforts [9  10  11]. We also note that color constancy of individual neurons plays an important role
both in the accuracy of the segmentation (Fig. 4) and the supervoxelized problem size.
While we did not focus on post-processing in this paper  basic algorithms (e.g.  reassignment of small 
isolated supervoxels) may improve both the visualization and the segmentation quality. Similarly 
more elaborate formulations of the adjacency relationship between supervoxels can increase the
accuracy. Finally  supervised learning of this relationship (when labeled data is present) is a promising
direction  and our methods can signiﬁcantly accelerate the generation of training sets.
