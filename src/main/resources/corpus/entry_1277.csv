2019,DM2C: Deep Mixed-Modal Clustering,Data exhibited with multiple modalities are ubiquitous in real-world clustering tasks. Most existing methods  however  pose a strong assumption that the pairing information for modalities is available for all instances. In this paper  we consider a more challenging task where each instance is represented in only one modality  which we call mixed-modal data. Without any extra pairing supervision across modalities  it is difficult to find a universal semantic space for all of them. To tackle this problem  we present an adversarial learning framework for clustering with mixed-modal data. Instead of transforming all the samples into a joint modality-independent space  our framework learns the mappings across individual modal spaces by virtue of cycle-consistency. Through these mappings  we could easily unify all the samples into a single modal space and perform the clustering. Evaluations on several real-world mixed-modal datasets could demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework.,Formatting Instructions For NeurIPS 2019

Abstract

The abstract paragraph should be indented 1/2 inch (3 picas) on both the left- and
right-hand margins. Use 10 point type  with a vertical spacing (leading) of 11 points.
The word Abstract must be centered  bold  and in point size 12. Two line spaces
precede the abstract. The abstract must be limited to one paragraph.

1 Submission of papers to NeurIPS 2019

NeurIPS requires electronic submissions. The electronic submission site is

https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/NeurIPS2019/

Please read the instructions below carefully and follow them faithfully.

1.1 Style

Papers to be submitted to NeurIPS 2019 must be prepared according to the instructions presented
here. Papers may only be up to eight pages long  including ﬁgures. Additional pages containing only
acknowledgments and/or cited references are allowed. Papers that exceed eight pages of content
(ignoring references) will not be reviewed  or in any other way considered for presentation at the
conference.
The margins in 2019 are the same as since 2007  which allow for ∼15% more words in the paper
compared to earlier years.
Authors are required to use the NeurIPS LATEX style ﬁles obtainable at the NeurIPS website as
indicated below. Please make sure you use the current ﬁles and not previous versions. Tweaking the
style ﬁles may be grounds for rejection.

1.2 Retrieval of style ﬁles

The style ﬁles for NeurIPS and other conference information are available on the World Wide Web at

http://www.neurips.cc/

The ﬁle neurips_2019.pdf contains these instructions and illustrates the various formatting re-
quirements your NeurIPS paper must satisfy.
The only supported style ﬁle for NeurIPS 2019 is neurips_2019.sty  rewritten for LATEX 2ε.
Previous style ﬁles for LATEX 2.09  Microsoft Word  and RTF are no longer supported!

∗Use footnote for providing further information about author (webpage  alternative address)—not for

acknowledging funding agencies.

33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019)  Vancouver  Canada.

The LATEX style ﬁle contains three optional arguments: final  which creates a camera-ready copy 
preprint  which creates a preprint for submission to  e.g.  arXiv  and nonatbib  which will not
load the natbib package for you in case of package clash.

Preprint option If you wish to post a preprint of your work online  e.g.  on arXiv  using the
NeurIPS style  please use the preprint option. This will create a nonanonymized version of your
work with the text “Preprint. Work in progress.” in the footer. This version may be distributed as
you see ﬁt. Please do not use the final option  which should only be used for papers accepted to
NeurIPS.
At submission time  please omit the final and preprint options. This will anonymize your
submission and add line numbers to aid review. Please do not refer to these line numbers in your
paper as they will be removed during generation of camera-ready copies.
The ﬁle neurips_2019.tex may be used as a “shell” for writing your paper. All you have to do is
replace the author  title  abstract  and text of the paper with your own.
The formatting instructions contained in these style ﬁles are summarized in Sections 2  3  and 4
below.

2 General formatting instructions

The text must be conﬁned within a rectangle 5.5 inches (33 picas) wide and 9 inches (54 picas) long.
The left margin is 1.5 inch (9 picas). Use 10 point type with a vertical spacing (leading) of 11 points.
Times New Roman is the preferred typeface throughout  and will be selected for you by default.
Paragraphs are separated by 1/2 line space (5.5 points)  with no indentation.
The paper title should be 17 point  initial caps/lower case  bold  centered between two horizontal
rules. The top rule should be 4 points thick and the bottom rule should be 1 point thick. Allow 1/4 inch
space above and below the title to rules. All pages should start at 1 inch (6 picas) from the top of the
page.
For the ﬁnal version  authors’ names are set in boldface  and each name is centered above the
corresponding address. The lead author’s name is to be listed ﬁrst (left-most)  and the co-authors’
names (if different address) are set to follow. If there is only one co-author  list both author and
co-author side by side.
Please pay special attention to the instructions in Section 4 regarding ﬁgures  tables  acknowledgments 
and references.

3 Headings: ﬁrst level

All headings should be lower case (except for ﬁrst word and proper nouns)  ﬂush left  and bold.
First-level headings should be in 12-point type.

3.1 Headings: second level

Second-level headings should be in 10-point type.

3.1.1 Headings: third level

Third-level headings should be in 10-point type.

Paragraphs There is also a \paragraph command available  which sets the heading in bold  ﬂush
left  and inline with the text  with the heading followed by 1 em of space.

4 Citations  ﬁgures  tables  references

These instructions apply to everyone.

Figure 1: Sample ﬁgure caption.

4.1 Citations within the text

The natbib package will be loaded for you by default. Citations may be author/year or numeric  as
long as you maintain internal consistency. As to the format of the references themselves  any style is
acceptable as long as it is used consistently.
The documentation for natbib may be found at

http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf

Of note is the command \citet  which produces citations appropriate for use in inline text. For
example 

\citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots

produces

Hasselmo  et al. (1995) investigated. . .

If you wish to load the natbib package with options  you may add the following before loading the
neurips_2019 package:

\PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}

If natbib clashes with another package you load  you can add the optional argument nonatbib
when loading the style ﬁle:

\usepackage[nonatbib]{neurips_2019}

As submission is double blind  refer to your own published work in the third person. That is  use “In
the previous work of Jones et al. [4] ” not “In our previous work [4].” If you cite your other papers
that are not widely available (e.g.  a journal paper under review)  use anonymous author names in the
citation  e.g.  an author of the form “A. Anonymous.”

4.2 Footnotes

Footnotes should be used sparingly. If you do require a footnote  indicate footnotes with a number2
in the text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear. Precede the footnote
with a horizontal rule of 2 inches (12 picas).
Note that footnotes are properly typeset after punctuation marks.3

4.3 Figures

All artwork must be neat  clean  and legible. Lines should be dark enough for purposes of reproduction.
The ﬁgure number and caption always appear after the ﬁgure. Place one line space before the ﬁgure

2Sample of the ﬁrst footnote.
3As in this example.

caption and one line space after the ﬁgure. The ﬁgure caption should be lower case (except for ﬁrst
word and proper nouns); ﬁgures are numbered consecutively.
You may use color ﬁgures. However  it is best for the ﬁgure captions and the paper body to be legible
if the paper is printed in either black/white or in color.

4.4 Tables

All tables must be centered  neat  clean and legible. The table number and title always appear before
the table. See Table 1.
Place one line space before the table title  one line space after the table title  and one line space after
the table. The table title must be lower case (except for ﬁrst word and proper nouns); tables are
numbered consecutively.
Note that publication-quality tables do not contain vertical rules. We strongly suggest the use of the
booktabs package  which allows for typesetting high-quality  professional tables:

https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs

This package was used to typeset Table 1.

5 Final instructions

Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style ﬁles. In particular  do not modify
the width or length of the rectangle the text should ﬁt into  and do not change font sizes (except
perhaps in the References section; see below). Please note that pages should be numbered.

6 Preparing PDF ﬁles

Please prepare submission ﬁles with paper size “US Letter ” and not  for example  “A4.”
Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF ﬁle must only contain Type 1 or
Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few instructions to achieve this.

• You should directly generate PDF ﬁles using pdflatex.
• You can check which fonts a PDF ﬁles uses.

In Acrobat Reader  select the menu
Files>Document Properties>Fonts and select Show All Fonts. You can also use the program
pdffonts which comes with xpdf and is available out-of-the-box on most Linux machines.
• The IEEE has recommendations for generating PDF ﬁles whose fonts are also ac-
ceptable for NeurIPS. Please see http://www.emfield.org/icuwb2010/downloads/
IEEE-PDF-SpecV32.pdf
• xfig "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap fonts. Use "solid" shapes instead.
• The \bbold package almost always uses bitmap fonts. You should use the equivalent AMS

Fonts:

\usepackage{amsfonts}

followed by  e.g.  \mathbb{R}  \mathbb{N}  or \mathbb{C} for R  N or C. You can also
use the following workaround for reals  natural and complex:

4

\newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
\newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
\newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers

Note that amsfonts is automatically loaded by the amssymb package.

If your ﬁle contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts  we will ask you to ﬁx it.

6.1 Margins in LATEX
Most of the margin problems come from ﬁgures positioned by hand using \special or other
commands. We suggest using the command \includegraphics from the graphicx package.
Always specify the ﬁgure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below:

\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}

See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation (http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/
latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf)
A number of width problems arise when LATEX cannot properly hyphenate a line. Please give LaTeX
hyphenation hints using the \- command when necessary.

Acknowledgments

Use unnumbered third level headings for the acknowledgments. All acknowledgments go at the end
of the paper. Do not include acknowledgments in the anonymized submission  only in the ﬁnal paper.

References

References follow the acknowledgments. Use unnumbered ﬁrst-level heading for the references. Any
choice of citation style is acceptable as long as you are consistent. It is permissible to reduce the font
size to small (9 point) when listing the references. Remember that you can use more than eight
pages as long as the additional pages contain only cited references.
