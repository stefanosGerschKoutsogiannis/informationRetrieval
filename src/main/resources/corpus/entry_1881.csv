Abstract

A method for computing the rarity of latent ﬁngerprints represented by minutiae
is given. It allows determining the probability of ﬁnding a match for an evidence
print in a database of n known prints. The probability of random correspondence
between evidence and database is determined in three procedural steps. In the
registration step the latent print is aligned by ﬁnding its core point; which is done
using a procedure based on a machine learning approach based on Gaussian pro-
cesses. In the evidence probability evaluation step a generative model based on
Bayesian networks is used to determine the probability of the evidence; it takes
into account both the dependency of each minutia on nearby minutiae and the
conﬁdence of their presence in the evidence. In the speciﬁc probability of random
correspondence step the evidence probability is used to determine the probability
of match among n for a given tolerance; the last evaluation is similar to the birth-
day correspondence probability for a speciﬁc birthday. The generative model is
validated using a goodness-of-ﬁt test evaluated with a standard database of ﬁnger-
prints. The probability of random correspondence for several latent ﬁngerprints
are evaluated for varying numbers of minutiae.

Introduction

In many forensic domains it is necessary to characterize the degree to which a given piece of ev-
idence is unique. For instance in the case of DNA a probability statement is made after a match
has been conﬁrmed between the evidence and the known  that the chance that a randomly selected
person would have the same DNA pattern is 1 in 24 000 000 which is a description of rarity of
the evidence/known [1]. In the case of ﬁngerprint evidence there is uncertainty at two levels: the
similarity between the evidence and the known and the rarity of the known. This paper explores
the evaluation of the rarity of a ﬁngerprint as characterized by a given set of features. Recent court
challenges have highlighted the need for statistical research on this problem especially if it is stated
that a high degree of similarity is present between the evidence and the known [2].

A statistical measure of the weight of evidence in forensics is a likelihood ratio (LR) deﬁned as
follows [3]. It is the ratio between the joint probability that the evidence and known come from the
same source  and the joint probability that the two come from two different sources. If the underlying
distributions are Gaussian the LR can be simpliﬁed as the product of two exponential factors: the
ﬁrst is a signiﬁcance test of the null hypothesis of identity  and the second measures rarity. Since
evaluation of the joint probability is difﬁcult for ﬁngerprints  which are characterized by variable sets
of minutia points with each point itself expressed as a 3-tuple of spatial co-ordinates and an angle  the
LR computation is usually replaced by one wherein a similarity (or kernel) function is introduced
between the evidence and the known and the likelihood ratio is computed for the similarity [4 
5]. While such efforts concern the signiﬁcance of the null hypothesis of identity  ﬁngerprint rarity
continues to be a difﬁcult problem and has never been solved. This paper describes a systematic
approach for the computation of the rarity of ﬁngerprints in a robust and reliable manner.

The process involves several individual steps. Due to varying quality of ﬁngerprints collected from
the crime scene  called latent prints  a registration process is needed to determine which area of
ﬁnger skin the print comes from; Section 2 describes the use of Gaussian processes to predict core
points by which prints can be aligned. In Section 3 a generative model based on Bayesian networks
is proposed to model the distribution of minutiae as well as the dependencies between them. To
measure rarity  a metric for assessing the probability of random correspondence of a speciﬁc print
against n samples is deﬁned in Section 4. The model is validated using a goodness-of-ﬁt test in
Section 5. Some examples of evaluation of rarity are given in Section 6.

2 Fingerprint Registration

The ﬁngerprint collected from the crime scene is usually only a small portion of the complete ﬁn-
gerprint. So the feature set extracted from the print only contains relative spatial relationship. It’s
obvious that feature sets with same relative spatial relationship can lead to different rarity if they
come from the different areas of the ﬁngertip. To solve this problem  we ﬁrst predict the core points
and then align the ﬁngerprints by overlapping their core points. In biometrics and ﬁngerprint anal-
ysis  core point refers to the center area of a ﬁngerprint. In practice  the core point corresponds
to the center of the north most loop type singularity. For ﬁngerprints that do not contain loop or
whorl singularities  the core is usually associated with the point of maxima ridge line curvature[6].
The most popular approaches proposed for core point detection is the Poincare Index (PI) which
is developed by [7  8  9]. Another commonly used method [10] is a sine map based method that
is realized by multi-resolution analysis. The methods based on Fourier expansion[11]  ﬁngerprint
structures [12] and multi-scale analysis [13] are also proposed. All of these methods require that the
ﬁngerprints are complete and the core points can be seen in the prints. But this is not the case for
all the ﬁngerprints. Latent prints are usually small partial prints and do not contain core points. So
there’s no way to detect them by above computational vision based approaches.

We proposes a core point prediction approach that turns this problem into a regression problem.
Since the ridge ﬂow directions reveal the intrinsic features of ridge topologies  and thus have crit-
ical impact on core point prediction. The orientation maps are used to predict the core points. A
ﬁngerprint ﬁeld orientation map is deﬁned as a collection of two-dimensional direction ﬁelds. It
represents the directions of ridge ﬂows in regular spaced grids. The gradients of gray intensity
of enhanced ﬁngerprints are estimated to obtain reliable ridge orientation [9]. Given an orienta-
tion map of a ﬁngerprint  the core point is predicted using Gaussian processes. Gaussian processes
dispense with the parametric model and instead deﬁne a probability distribution over functions di-
rectly. It provides more ﬂexibility and better prediction. The advantage of Gaussian process model
also comes from the probabilistic formulation[14]. Instead of representing the core point as a sin-
gle value  the predication of the core point from Gaussian process model takes the form of a full
predictive distribution.
Suppose we have a training set D of N ﬁngerprints  D = {(gi  yi)|i = 1  . . .   N }  where g denotes
the orientation map of a ﬁngerprint print and y denotes the output which is the core point. In order
to predict the core points  Gaussian process model with squared exponential covariance function is
applied. The regression model with Gaussian noise is given by

(1)
where f (g) is the value of the process or function f (x) at g and ǫ is a random noise variable whose
value is chosen independent for each observation. We consider the noise processes that have a
Gaussian distribution  so that the Gaussian likelihood for core point is given by

y = f (g) + ǫ

(2)
where σ2 is the variance of the noise. From the deﬁnition of a Gaussian process  the Gaussian
process prior is given by a Gaussian whose mean is zero and whose covariance is deﬁned by a
covariance function k(g  g′) so that

p(y|f (g)) = N (f   σ2I)

(3)
The squared exponential covariance function is used here to specify the covariance between pairs of
variables  parameterized by θ1 and θ2.

f (g) ∼ GP(0  k(g  g′))

k(g  g′) = θ1 exp(−

θ2
2

|g − g′|2)

(4)

where the hyperparameters θ1 and θ2 are optimized by maximizing of the log likelihood p(y|θ1  θ2)
Suppose the orientation map of a input ﬁngerprint is given by g∗. The Gaussian predictive distribu-
tion of core point y∗ can be evaluated by conditioning the joint Gaussian prior distribution on the
observation (G  y)  where G = (g1  . . .   gN )⊤ and y = (y1  . . .   yN )⊤. The predictive distribution
is given by

p(y∗|g∗  G  y) = N (m(y∗)  cov(y∗))

(5)

where

m(y∗) = k(g∗  G)[K + σ2I]−1y

cov(y∗) = k(g∗  g∗) + σ2 − k(g∗  G)⊤[K + σ2I]−1k(G  g∗)

(6)
(7)

where K is the Gram matrix whose elements are given by k(gi  gj).
Note that for some ﬁngerprints such as latent ﬁngerprints collected from crime scene  their locations
in the complete print are unknown. So any g∗ only represents the orientation map of the print in one
possible location. In order to predict the core point in the correct location  we list all the possible
print locations corresponding to the different translations and rotations. The orientation maps of
i |i = 1  . . .   m}. Using (5)  we obtain the predictive distributions
them are deﬁned as G = {g∗
i   G  y) with respect to g∗
i .
p(y∗|g∗
Thus the core point of the ﬁngerprint is given by

i . The core point ˆy∗ should maximize p(y∗|g∗

i   G  y) for all the g∗

(8)
M AX is the orientation map where the maximum predictive probability of core point can be

M AX   G)[K + σ2I]−1y

ˆy∗ = k(g∗

where g∗
obtained  given by

g∗

M AX = argmax

g∗

p(m(y∗)|g∗  G  y)

(9)

After the core points are determined  the ﬁngerprints can be aligned by overlapping their core points.
This is done by presenting the features in the Cartesian coordinates where the origin is the core point.
Note that the minutia features mentioned in following sections have been aligned ﬁrst.

3 A Generative Model for Fingerprints

In order to estimate rarity  statistical models need to be developed to represent the distribution of
ﬁngerprint features. Previous generative models for ﬁngerprints involve different assumptions: uni-
form distribution of minutia locations and directions [15] and minutiae are independent of each other
[16  17]. However  minutiae that are spatially close tend to have similar directions with each other
[18]. Moreover  ﬁngerprint ridges ﬂow smoothly with very slow orientation change. The variance of
the minutia directions in different regions of the ﬁngerprint are dependent on both their locations and
location variance [19  20]. These observations on the dependency between minutiae need to be ac-
counted for in eliciting reliable statistical models. The proposed model incorporates the distribution
of minutiae and the dependency relationship between them.

Minutiae are the most commonly used features for representing ﬁngerprints. They correspond to
ridge endings and ridge bifurcations. Each minutia is represented by its location and direction. The
direction is determined by the ridge at the location. Automatic ﬁngerprint matching algorithms use
minutiae as the salient features [21]  since they are stable and are reliably extracted. Each minutia is
represented as x = (s  θ) where s = (x1  x2) is its location and θ its direction.
In order to capture the distribution of minutiae as well as the dependencies between them  we ﬁrst
propose a method to deﬁne a unique sequence for a given set of minutiae. Suppose that a ﬁngerprint
contains N minutiae. The sequence starts with the minutia x1 whose location is closest to the core
point. Each remaining minutia xn is the spatially closest to the centroid deﬁned by the arithmetic
mean of the location coordinates of all the previous minutiae x1  . . . xn−1. Given this sequence  the
ﬁngerprint can be represented by a minutia sequence X = (x1  . . .   xN ). The sequence is robust
to the variance of the minutiae because the next minutia is decided by the all the previous minu-
tiae. Given the observation that spatially closer minutiae are more strongly related  we only model
the dependence between xn and its nearest minutia among {x1  . . .   xn−1}. Although not all the
dependence is taken into account  this is a good trade-off between model accuracy and computa-
tional complexity. Figure 1(a) presents an example where x5 is determined because its distance to
the centroid of {x1  . . .   x4} is minimal. Figure 1(b) shows the minutia sequence and the minutia

dependencies (arrows) for the same conﬁguration of minutiae. Based on the characteristic of ﬁnger-
print minutiae studied in [18  19  20]  we know that the minutia direction is related to its location
and the neighboring minutiae. The minutia location is conditional independent of the location of
the neighboring minutiae given their directions. To address the probabilistic relationships of the
minutiae  Bayesian networks are used to represent the distributions of the minutia features in ﬁnger-
prints. Figure 2 shows the Bayesian network for the distribution of the minutia set given in Figure
1. The nodes sn and θn represent the location and direction of minutia xn. For each conditional
distribution  a directed link is added to the graph from the nodes corresponding to the variables on
which the distribution is conditioned. In general  for a given ﬁngerprint  the joint distribution over
its minutia set X is given by

p(X) = p(s1)p(θ1|s1)

NYn=2

p(sn)p(θn|sn  sψ(n)  θψ(n))

(10)

where sψ(n) and θψ(n) are the location and direction of the minutia xi which has the minimal spatial
distance to the minutia xn. So ψ(n) is given by

ψ(n) = argmin
i∈[1 n−1]

kxn − xik

(11)

To compute above joint probability  there are three probability density functions need to be esti-
mated: distribution of the location of minutiae f (s)  joint distribution of the location and direction
of minutiae f (s  θ)  and conditional distribution of minutia direction given its location  and the lo-
cation and direction of the nearest minutia f (θn|sn  sψ(n)  θψ(n)).
It is known that minutiae tend to form clusters [18] and minutiae in different regions of the ﬁnger-
print are observed to be associated with different region-speciﬁc minutia directions. A mixture of
Gaussian is a natural approach to model the minutia location given by (12). Since minutia orienta-
tion is a periodic variable  it is modeled by the von Mises distribution which itself is derived from the
Gaussian. The minutia represented by its location and direction is modeled by the mixture of joint
Gaussian and von-Mises distribution [22] give by (13). Given its location and the nearest minutia 
the minutia direction has the mixture of von-Mises density given by (14).

is used to estimate Ki and other parameters are learned by EM algorithm.

4 Evaluation of Rarity of a Fingerprint

The general probability of random correspondence (PRC) can be modiﬁed to give the probability
of matching the speciﬁc evidence within a database of n items  where the match is within some
tolerance in feature space [23]. The metric of rarity is speciﬁc nPRC  the probability that data
with value x coincides with an element in a set of n samples  within speciﬁed tolerance. Since
we are trying to match a speciﬁc value x  this probability depends on the probability of x. Let
Y = [y1  ...  yn] represent a set of n random variables. A binary-valued random variable z indicates
that if one sample yi exists in a set of n random samples so that the value of yi is the same as x
within a tolerance ǫ. By noting the independence of x and yi  the speciﬁc nPRC is then given by
the marginal probability

p(z = 1|x  Y)p(Y)

(15)

p(z = 1|x) =XY

where p(Y) is the joint probability of the n individuals.
To compute speciﬁc nPRC  we ﬁrst deﬁne correspondence or match  between two minutiae as fol-
lows. Let xa = (sa  θa) and xb = (sb  θb) be a pair of minutiae. The minutiae are said to correspond
if for tolerance ǫ = [ǫs  ǫθ] 

k sa − sb k≤ ǫs ∧ |θa − θb| ≤ ǫθ

(16)
where ksa − sbk is the Euclidean distance between the minutia locations. Then  the match between
two ﬁngerprints is deﬁned as existing at least ˆm pairs of matched minutiae between two ﬁngerprints.
The tolerances ǫ and ˆm depend on practical applications.
To deal with the largely varying quality in latent ﬁngerprints  it is also important to consider the
minutia conﬁdence in speciﬁc nPRC measurement. The conﬁdence of the minutia xn is deﬁned as
(dsn   dθn )  where dsn is the conﬁdence of location and dθn is the conﬁdence of direction. Given
the minutia xn = (sn  θn) and its conﬁdences  the probability density functions of location s′ and
direction θ′ can be modeled using Gaussian and von-Mises distribution given by

c(s′|sn  dsn ) = N (s′|sn  d−1
sn )

(17)

(18)
where the variance of the location distribution (Gaussian) is the inverse of the location conﬁdence
and the concentration parameter of the direction distribution (von-Mises) is the direction conﬁdence.

c(θ′|θn  dθn ) = V(θ′|θn  dθn )

Let f be a randomly sampled ﬁngerprint which has minutia set X′ = {x′

5 Model Validation

In order to validate the proposed methods  core point prediction was ﬁrst tested. Goodness-of-ﬁt
tests were performed on the proposed generative models. Two databases were used  one is NIST4 
and the other is NIST27. NIST4 contains 8-bit gray scale images of randomly selected ﬁngerprints.
Each print has 512 × 512 pixels. The entire database contains ﬁngerprints taken from 2000 different
ﬁngers with 2 impression of the same ﬁnger. NIST27 contains latent ﬁngerprints from crime scenes
and their matching rolled ﬁngerprint mates. There are 258 latent cases separated into three quality
categories of good  bad  and ugly.

5.1 Core Point Prediction

The Gaussian process models for core point prediction are trained on NIST4 and tested on NIST27.
The orientation maps are extracted by conventional gradient-based approach. The ﬁngerprint images
are ﬁrst divided into equal-sized blocks of N × N pixels  where N is the average width of a pair
of ridge and valley. The value of N is 8 in NIST4 and varies in NIST27. The gradient vectors are
calculated by taking the partial derivatives of image intensity at each pixel in Cartesian coordinates.
The ridge orientation is perpendicular to the dominant gradient angle in the local block. The training
set consists of the orientation maps of the ﬁngerprints and the corresponding core points which are
marked manually. The core point prediction is applied on three groups of latent prints in different
quality. Figure 3 shows the results of core point prediction and subsequent latent print localization
given two latent ﬁngerprints from NIST27. Table 1 shows the comparison of prediction precisions of
Gaussian Processes (GP) based approach and the widely used Poincare Index (PI) [8]. The test latent
prints are extracted and enhanced manually. The true core points of the latent prints are picked from
the matching 10-prints. Correct prediction is determined by comparing the location and direction
distances between predicted and true core points with the threshold parameters set at Ts = 16 pixels 
and Tθ = π/6. Good quality set contains 88 images that mostly contain the core points. Both bad
and ugly quality sets contain 85 images that have small size and usually do not include core points.
Among the precisions of good quality latent prints  two approaches are close. Precisions of bad
and ugly quality show distinct difference between two methods and indicate that GP based method
provides core point prediction even though the core points can not be seen in the latent prints. The
GP based method also results in higher overall prediction precisions.

5.2 Goodness-of-ﬁt

The validation of the proposed generative model is by means of a goodness-of-ﬁt test which deter-
mines as to how well a sample of data agrees with the proposed model distribution. The chi-square

statistical hypothesis test was applied [24]. Three different tests were conducted for : (i) distribu-
tion of minutia location (12)  (ii) joint distribution of minutia location and orientation (13)  and (iii)
distributions of minutia dependency (14). For minutia location  we partitioned the minutia location
space into 16 non-overlapping blocks. For minutia location and orientation  we partitioned the fea-
ture space into 16 × 4 non-overlapping blocks. For minutia dependency  the orientation space is
divided into 9 non-overlapping blocks. The blocks are combined with adjacent blocks until both
observed and expected numbers of minutiae in the block are greater than or equal to 5. The test
statistic used here is a chi-square random variable χ2 deﬁned by the following equation.

χ2 =Xi

(Oi − Ei)2

Ei

(25)

where Oi is the observed minutia count for the ith block  and Ei is the expected minutia count for
the ith block. The p-value  the probability of observing a sample statistic as extreme as the test
statistic  associated with each test statistic χ2 is then calculated based on the chi-square distribution
and compared to the signiﬁcance level. For the NIST 4 dataset  we chose signiﬁcance level equal to
0.01. 4000 ﬁngerprints are used to train the generative models proposed in Sections 3.
To test the models for minutia location  and minutia location and orientation  the numbers of ﬁnger-
prints with p-values above (corresponding to accept the model) and below (corresponding to reject
the model) the signiﬁcance level are computed. Of the 4000 ﬁngerprints  3387 are accepted and
613 are rejected for minutia location model  and 3216 are accepted and 784 are rejected for minutia
location and orientation model. To test the model for minutia dependency  we ﬁrst collect all the
linked minutia pairs in the minutia sequences produced from 4000 ﬁngerprints. Then these minutia
pairs are separated by the binned locations of both minutiae (32 × 32) and orientation of the leading
minutia (4). Finally  the minutia dependency models can be tested on the corresponding minutia
pair sets. Of the 4096 data sets  3558 are accepted and 538 are rejected. The results imply that the
proposed generative models offer reasonable and accurate ﬁt to ﬁngerprints.

6 Fingerprint Rarity measurement on Latent Prints

The method for assessing ﬁngerprint rarity using the validated model is demonstrated here. Figure 4
shows two latent ﬁngerprints randomly picked from NIST27. The ﬁrst latent print “b115” contains
16 minutiae and the second “g73” contains 39 minutiae. The conﬁdences of minutiae are manually
assigned by visual inspection. The speciﬁc nPRC of the two latent prints are given by Table 3. The
speciﬁc nPRCs are calculated through varying numbers of matching minutia pairs ( ˆm)  assuming
that the number of ﬁngerprints (n) is 100  000. The tolerance is set at ǫs = 10 pixels and ǫθ = π/8.
The experiment shows that the values of speciﬁc nPRC are largely dependent on the given latent
ﬁngerprint. For the latent print that contains more minutiae or whose minutiae are more common in
minutia population  the probability that the latent print shares ˆm minutiae with a random ﬁngerprint
is more. It is obvious to note that  when ˆm decreases  the probability of random correspondence
increases. Moreover  the values of speciﬁc nPRC provide a strong argument for the values of latent
ﬁngerprint evidences.

7 Summary

This work is the ﬁrst attempt of offering a systematic method to measure the rarity of ﬁngerprints.
In order to align the prints  a Gaussian processes based approach is proposed to predict the core
points. It is proven that this approach can predict core points whether the prints contain the core
points or not. Furthermore  a generative model is proposed to model the distribution of minutiae
as well as the dependency between them. Bayesian networks are used to perform inference and
learning by visualizing the structures of the generative models. Finally  the rarity of a ﬁngerprint
is able to calculated. To further improve the accuracy  minutia conﬁdences are taken into account
for speciﬁc nPRC calculation. Goodness of ﬁt tests shows that the proposed generative offers an
accurate ﬁngerprint representation. We perform the speciﬁc nPRC computation on NIST27 dataset.
It is shown that the proposed method is capable of estimating the rarity of real-life latent ﬁngerprints.
