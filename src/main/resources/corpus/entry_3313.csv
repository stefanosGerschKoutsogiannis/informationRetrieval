Abstract

This paper addresses the general problem of blind echo retrieval  i.e.  given M
sensors measuring in the discrete-time domain M mixtures of K delayed and
attenuated copies of an unknown source signal  can the echo locations and weights
be recovered? This problem has broad applications in ﬁelds such as sonars  seismol-
ogy  ultrasounds or room acoustics. It belongs to the broader class of blind channel
identiﬁcation problems  which have been intensively studied in signal processing.
Existing methods in the literature proceed in two steps: (i) blind estimation of
sparse discrete-time ﬁlters and (ii) echo information retrieval by peak-picking on
ﬁlters. The precision of these methods is fundamentally limited by the rate at which
the signals are sampled: estimated echo locations are necessary on-grid  and since
true locations never match the sampling grid  the weight estimation precision is
impacted. This is the so-called basis-mismatch problem in compressed sensing.
We propose a radically different approach to the problem  building on the frame-
work of ﬁnite-rate-of-innovation sampling. The approach operates directly in the
parameter-space of echo locations and weights  and enables near-exact blind and
off-grid echo retrieval from discrete-time measurements. It is shown to outperform
conventional methods by several orders of magnitude in precision.

Introduction

When a wave propagates from a point source through a medium and is reﬂected on surfaces before
reaching sensors  the measured signals consist of mixtures of the direct path signal with delayed
and attenuated copies of itself. This physical phenomenon is commonly referred to as echoes and
has a wide range of applications in different areas of science  from sonars [1] to seismology [2] 
from acoustics [3  4  5] to ultrasounds [6]. For instance  in acoustics  it has been shown that precise
knowledge of early echo timing enables the estimation of the positions of reﬂective surfaces in a room
[3  4]. In [3]  the approximate 3D geometry of Lausanne cathedral could be retrieved in this way. On
the other hand  echoes’ attenuation capture information about the acoustic impedance of surfaces 
which is notoriously hard to measure or estimate in practice [7  8]. In [9] and [10]  it is shown that
knowing the attenuation and timing of early echoes may improve beamforming and source separation
performance  respectively. Systems using echoes for beamforming are commonly referred to as rake
receivers in the wireless literature [11].
Retrieving echo properties when the emitted signal is known is referred to as active echolocation in
biology  and is well exempliﬁed by the sensory system of echoing bats. This principle is for instance

32nd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2018)  Montréal  Canada.

at the heart of active sonar technologies. In the signal processing literature  this problem belongs to
the category of system or channel identiﬁcation  i.e.  estimating the ﬁlters from a known input to the
observed output of a linear system. In the case of echoes  these linear ﬁlters consist of streams of
Diracs in the continuous-time domain and are hence sparse in the discrete-time domain. The more
challenging problem of estimating echoes/ﬁlters when the emitted signal is unknown is referred to as
passive echolocation or blind system identiﬁcation (BSI) [12  13  14  15  16  17  18  5  19  20]. BSI is
a long-standing and still active research topic in signal processing  notably due to its fundamental ill-
posedness. In the general setting of arbitrary signals and ﬁlters  rigorous theoretical ambiguities under
which the problem is unsolvable have been identiﬁed [12]. A number of methods for multichannel
BSI with general signals and ﬁlters have been developed some time ago [12  13  14]. Some well-
known limitations of these approaches are their sensitivity to the chosen length of ﬁlters  and their
intractability when the ﬁlters are too large. Following the compressed sensing wave [21]  a number
of methods extending these BSI methods to the case of sparse [15  16  17  18  5] or structured [20]
ﬁlters have been developed. They generally extend classical methods using regularizers such as
the (cid:96)1-norm for sparsity or a bilinear constraint as in [20]. Similarly to classical ﬁlter estimation
methods  they require knowledge of the ﬁlters’ length and they work in the space of discrete-time
ﬁlters which are typically thousands of samples long. Because they work in the discrete-time domain 
the accuracy at which these methods can recover echo locations is fundamentally limited by the
signal’s frequency of sampling: the recovered echoes are on-grid. Moreover  the sparsity assumption
on ﬁlters is invalid in practice due to smoothing and sampling effects at sensors. Interestingly  [22]
employs a continuous-time spike model for single-channel blind deconvolution but relies on a strong
linear prior on the signal.
In this paper  we propose a drastically different approach to blind echo retrieval based on the
framework of ﬁnite-rate-of-innovation (FRI) sampling [23  24  25]. In stark contrast with existing
methods  the approach directly operates in the space of continuous-time echoes  and is hence able to
blindly recover their locations off-grid. The proposed method is shown to recover echo delays and
attenuation with an accuracy far higher than what the sampling rate would normally allow  using
noiseless multichannel discrete-time measurements of an unknown simulated speech emitter in a
room. The method does not assume that the ﬁlters are ﬁnite-length and only requires the number of
echoes. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2 the signal and measurement
models and notations are introduced  and conventional methods are brieﬂy reviewed. In section 3
the proposed approach is presented in the non-blind and blind cases. In section 4 the method is
compared and evaluated on both synthetic and room acoustic data. Conclusions and future directions
are outlined in section 5.

2 Background

2.1 The signal and measurement models

We start by deﬁning the signal model in the continuous-time domain. Suppose a source emits a

band-limited signal(cid:101)s(t) which is reﬂected and attenuated K times before reaching M sensors. The
continuous signal impinging at sensor m is(cid:101)xm(t) = ((cid:101)hm ∗(cid:101)s)(t)
where(cid:101)hm is a linear ﬁlter from the source to sensor m and ∗ denotes the continuous convolution

The ﬁlter consists of the following stream of Diracs:

where δ denotes the Dirac delta function  {τm k}K
k=1 denote the K propagation times from the source
to sensor m in seconds  i.e.

Let ˆxm ∈ RN denote N consecutive discrete samples collected by sensor m. Most measurement
models assume that the impinging signal undergoes an ideal low-pass ﬁlter with frequency support
[−Fs/2  Fs/2] before being regularly sampled at the rate Fs in Hz. This is expressed by

where(cid:101)φ = sin(πt)/πt is the classical sinc sampling Kernel. The continuous-time model (1) can then

be approximated in two different ways  described in the next two sub-sections.

2.1.1 Discrete time-domain model
First  model (1) can be approximated in the discrete  ﬁnite-time domain. Let ˆhm ∈ RL and

ˆs ∈ RN +L−1 denote discrete  sampled versions of the ﬁlter(cid:101)hm and signal(cid:101)s respectively. We then

have

Here  it is important to note that contrary to intuition  even in the idealized case where an inﬁnite
number of samples are available  the discrete-time ﬁlters {ˆhm}M
m=1 involved in the measurement
model are never streams of Diracs  but non-sparse  inﬁnite-length ﬁlters consisting of decimated
combinations of sinc functions. This is illustrated in Fig. 1. Recovering the original Dirac positions
and coefﬁcients from ﬁnitely many samples of such ﬁlters is a challenging task in itself.

2.1.2 Discrete frequency-domain model
Alternatively  one may approximate model (1) in the discrete ﬁnite-frequency domain. Let xm ∈ CF
denote the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of ˆxm  deﬁned by

xm(f ) = DFT(ˆxm) =

ˆxm(n)e−2πif n/Fs

(10)

N−1(cid:88)

n=0

where f belongs to a set of F regularly-spaced frequencies F = {f1  . . .   fF} ⊂]0  Fs/2] in Hz. We
then have the following approximate model:

(cid:32) K(cid:88)

(cid:33)

xm(f ) ≈ hm(f )s(f ) ≈

cm ke−2πif τm k

s(f )

(11)

k=1

where hm ∈ CF and s ∈ CF denote the DFT of ˆhm and ˆs  respectively. Two approximations are
made in (11). First  the time-domain convolution between ˆhm and ˆs has been transformed into a
multiplication through the DFT. This would be exact for a circular convolution  but the actual model
is a linear convolution between inﬁnite and non periodic signals  resulting in an approximation error.
Second  the formula used for hm in the right hand side of (11) is the one that would result from the
discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) of ˆhm which would require inﬁnitely many samples N to be

calculated exactly  as opposed to the DFT. Note that the smoothing sinc kernel(cid:101)φ(t) does not impact

this formula  since only frequencies below Fs/2 are considered. Importantly  both approximations in
(11) become arbitrarily precise as the number of samples N grows to inﬁnity.

While both the discrete-time model (5) and the discrete-frequency model (11) become increas-
ingly accurate when N becomes large  the latter directly incorporates the variables of interest
{cm k  τm k}M K
m k=1  as opposed to the former. In the remainder of this paper  it will be assumed that

(cid:101)s(t) is bandlimited with maximum frequency less than Fs/2 and that N is sufﬁciently large such that

both models hold very well. This is a reasonable assumption in audio applications  where sensors
typically acquire tens of thousands of samples per second. Moreover  we focus on situations where
sensor noise is negligible. Hence  the approximation signs will be dropped for convenience.

2.2 Existing methods in channel identiﬁcation

To the best of the authors’ knowledge  all existing methods in blind channel identiﬁcation rely on the
discrete-time model (5) [12  13  14  15  16  17  18  5  19  20]. The case of general emitted signals
and ﬁnite ﬁlters was studied both methodologically and theoretically in the 90s [12  13  14]  where
two main categories of methods emerged  which we brieﬂy review here  focusing on the two-channel
(M = 2) case for simplicity. First  the so-called subspace methods rely on the estimation of a
time-domain M P × M P covariance matrix where P is a time-window length that must be larger
than the ﬁlters’ length L [14]. The ﬁlters are estimated by spectral decomposition of this matrix.
Second  the more common cross-relation (CR) methods rely on the observation that under noiseless
conditions we have ˆhm (cid:63) ˆxl − ˆhl (cid:63) ˆxm = 0N−L+1 for l (cid:54)= m ∈ {1  . . .   M}  by associativity of the
convolution. A common approach is therefore to solve a minimization problem of the form:

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)Toep(ˆx2)ˆh1 − Toep(ˆx1)ˆh2

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)2

2

∗
∗
1  ˆh
ˆh
2 = argmin
ˆh1(1)=1

 

(12)

which is a simple least-square problem. The constraint ˆh1(1) = 1 is used to avoid the trivial solution
ˆh1 = ˆh2 = 0L. Alternatively  the normalization (cid:107)ˆh1(cid:107)2
2 = 1 can be used  leading to a
minimum eigenvalue problem.

2 + (cid:107)ˆh2(cid:107)2

In the case of interest where the goal is to retrieve echo information from the ﬁlters  both subspace
[17] and to a larger extent CR [15  16  18  5] methods have been extended in order to handle sparse
ﬁlters. This approach requires two independent steps: ﬁrst estimating sparse ﬁlters  second retrieving
echo locations and weights from them  typically using a peak-picking technique. Following the
compressed sensing idea [21]  sparsity is usually promoted using an (cid:96)1-norm penalty term on the
ﬁlters. For instance in [16]  the following LASSO-type [27] problem is considered:

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)Toep(ˆx2)ˆh1 − Toep(ˆx1)ˆh2

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)2

2

∗
∗

ˆh
2 = argmin
ˆh1(1)=1

+ λ((cid:107)ˆh1(cid:107)1 + (cid:107)ˆh2(cid:107)1)

(13)

and a Bayesian-learning method for the automatic inference of λ is proposed. Several other approaches
relying on similar schemes [15  18  5] have been proposed.

Four important bottlenecks of discrete-time methods for echo retrieval can be identiﬁed:

4

• Although they rely on sparsity-enforcing regularizers  the ﬁlters are strictly-speaking non-
sparse in practice  due to the sinc kernel (Fig. 1). This general bottle-neck in compressed
sensing has been referred to as basis mismatch and was notably studied in [28]. In particular 
the true peaks of the ﬁlters do not correspond to the true echoes (Fig. 1)  even for N → ∞.
Though  most existing methods rely on peak-picking [18  5].
• For the same reason  these methods are fundamentally on-grid  namely  they can only
output echo locations which are integer multiple of the sampling period 1/Fs. This pre-
vents subsample resolution  which may be important in applications such as room shape
reconstruction from audio signals [3].
• These methods strongly rely on the knowledge of the length L of the ﬁlters. However  due
• The dimension of the search space is M L−1  which is much larger in practice than the actual
number 2M K of unknown variables. This makes the methods computationally demanding
and sometimes intractable for large ﬁlter lengths (typically in the tens of thousands for
acoustic applications).

to the sinc kernel (Sec. 2.1.1)  the true ﬁlters are always inﬁnite.

3 Off-grid echo retrieval by multichannel annihilation

In this section  we introduce a novel method for echo recovery that makes use of the discrete-frequency
model (11) and overcomes a number of shortcomings of existing approaches. Namely  it works
directly in the parameter space  it does not rely on the ﬁlters’ length but on the number of echoes 
and it enables exact off-grid recovery of echoes’ locations and weights in the noiseless case. The
approach relies on the ﬁnite rate of innovation (FRI) sampling paradigm introduced in [23]. This
is the ﬁrst time this paradigm is applied to blind channel identiﬁcation  to the best of the authors’
knowledge.

3.1 The non-blind case
We start by considering the non-blind case where the emitted signal s ∈ CF in the discrete frequency
domain is known. We further assume throughout the paper that this signal is nonzero on the considered
frequency grid F = {f1  . . .   fF}. We can then transform the discrete-frequency model (11) by
writing:

hm(f ) = xm(f )z(f ) =

(14)
where the Fourier-inverted signal z ∈ CF is deﬁned by z(f ) = s(f )−1. Our goal is to estimate
k=1 from hm = xm (cid:12) zm  where (cid:12) denotes the Hadamard product. If we take our
{cm k  τm k}K
frequency indexes F to be in arithmetic progression with step ∆f   then the exponential sequence
{e−2πifiτm k}F
i=1 is a geometric progression with ratio rm k = e−2πi∆f τm k for each m  k. Hence 
hm is a weighted sum of geometric progressions. This enables us to use the so called annihilating
ﬁlter technique [29]. This technique is based on the observation that

k=1

(15)
for any w ∈ C and F ∈ N. We deduce that if we deﬁne the ﬁlter am = [am 0  . . .   am K] ∈ CK+1
as the following discrete convolution1 of K ﬁlters of size 2:

[1 −w] (cid:63) [w0  w1  w2  . . .   wF−1] = 0F−1 

am = [1 −rm 1] (cid:63) [1 −rm 2] (cid:63) ··· (cid:63) [1 −rm K−1] (cid:63) [0K−1  1 −rm K  0K−1] 

(16)
then am is an annihilating ﬁlter for hm  i.e.  am (cid:63) hm = 0F−K. Importantly  the number of echoes
K has to be known upfront in order to deﬁne am. Let us now deﬁne the polynomial representation
of ﬁlter am by:

K(cid:88)

Pam[y] =

am kyk.

(17)

Because am is an annihilating ﬁlter for hm  it follows from the classical interpretation of convolution
as polynomial multiplication that Pam has exactly K roots  which are the ratios {rm k}K
k=1. Hence 

1The chained discrete convolutions in (16) have to be taken from right to left to be compatible with (6).

k=0

5

once an annihilating ﬁlter am for hm has been found  the Dirac locations {τm k}K
k=1 can be deduced
by rooting Pam. Once the roots are known  reconstructing the weights is a simple linear problem
involving a Vandermonde matrix V(rm) ∈ CF×K  obtained by writing (14) in matrix form:

(18)

where Dm = Diag(e−2πif1τ m) ∈ CK×K. The least-square solution of this system is given by
m V(rm)†hm where {·}† denotes the Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse. In practice  since
cm = D−1
positive weights are sought  the phases of this complex vector are discarded. General FRI theory [23]
tells us that F ≥ 2K + 1 is enough to uniquely recover the exact K Dirac locations and weights
using this method. In other words  the original echo retrieval problem has been reduced to that of
ﬁnding an annihilating ﬁlter for hm = xm (cid:12) z. In practice  this can be done by solving the following
minimization problem for m = 1  . . .   M:

a∗
m = argmin
2=1

(cid:107)am(cid:107)2

(cid:107)Toep(xm (cid:12) z)am(cid:107)2
2  

(19)

where the unit norm constraint is used to avoid the trivial solution am = 0K+1. The solution of this
problem is the eigenvector associated to the lowest eigenvalue of Toep(xm (cid:12) z). Assuming that the
true z is given  that model (11) holds exactly and that F ≥ 2K + 1  this eigenvalue will be unique
and equal to 0.

3.2 MULAN: an iterative scheme

In the blind echo retrieval problem of interest  the emitted signal s and hence z are unknown. To
solve for all unknown variables jointly  we introduce the following non-convex optimization problem:

z∗  a∗

1  . . .   a∗

M =

(cid:107)z(cid:107)2

2=(cid:107)a1(cid:107)2

2=1

M(cid:88)

m=1

(cid:107)Toep(xm (cid:12) z)am(cid:107)2
2 .

(20)

Our strategy to tackle this problem is by alternated minimization with respect to each variable.
Minimization with respect to each am is already covered by the previous section. Minimization with
respect to z is also a minimum eigenvalue problem  since the cost function C(z  a) can be rewritten:

M(cid:88)

M(cid:88)

(cid:107)Toep(xm (cid:12) z)am(cid:107)2

C(z  a) =
where Q = [Toep0(a1)Diag(x1); . . . ; Toep0(aM )Diag(xM )] ∈ CM (K+1)×F

2 = (cid:107)Qz(cid:107)2
2  

(21)

(22)

and [·;·] denotes vertical concatenation. If the algorithm succeeds in bringing down the cost function
to zero  it means that appropriate annihilating ﬁlters have been found for all channels for a given
Fourier-inverted signal z  and the locations and weights of all Diracs can be recovered. We call this
method MULAN for MULtichannel ANnihilation. Pseudo-code for the algorithm is given in Alg.
1. Since (20) is non-convex  the alternate minimization scheme is at best guaranteed to converge to
a stationary point of the cost-function C(z  a). To alleviate this issue  we propose to initialize the
method multiple times with random values of z and only keep the run with lowest ﬁnal C(z  a).

Identiﬁability and ambiguities

The identiﬁability of blind channel identiﬁcation for general discrete ﬁlters and signals has been
studied some time ago [12]. It is known that the ﬁlters {ˆhm}M
m=1 cannot be recovered if their
polynomial representations admit at least a common root or if the polynomial representation of the
emitted signal ˆs has less than 2L + 1 roots. The latter is ruled out if the emitted signal has a rich
enough spectral content (enough nonzero frequencies) which is usually the case for natural signals.
The former has at least one consequence in our case: the problem is unidentiﬁable if the observed
signals are scaled and delayed versions of each other  which may happen in practice. While other
common roots may appear in the general setting  it is important to note that MULAN restricts the
search of ﬁlters to those which are linear combinations of geometrical series in the frequency domain.
There is no complete theoretical study on common roots in this case  to the best of the authors’
knowledge. The authors of [30] theoretically studied blind deconvolution of sparse signals  but their
results do not apply here since our ﬁlters are not sparse (see Sec. 2.2). Another well-known ambiguity
is that the ﬁlters can only be recovered up to a global time-shift and scaling  because a converse
shifting and scaling of the emitted signal yields the same observations. We handle this by adopting
the convention τ1 1 = 0 and c1 1 = 1. Additionally  we assume that all echoes are located in the ﬁrst
half of temporal ﬁlters to avoid time-wrapping ambiguities. Finally  the proposed MULAN algorithm
has an extra speciﬁc ambiguity. It can be easily shown that multiplying the roots of all polynomials

m=1 by a complex scalar γ while dividing the Fourier-inverted signal z element-wise by
a geometric series of ratio γ does not change the cost function C(z  a). This can be handled by
rescaling the roots of all annihilating ﬁlters to have unit modulus at each iteration. However  since
only the complex arguments of the roots are used in the end  this appeared to be unnecessary in our
experiments.

4 Experiments

4.1 On-grid vs. off-grid echo retrieval

We ﬁrst emphasize the speciﬁc ability of the proposed method to recover echo locations off-grid
by comparing it to conventional on-grid methods on a simulated room-acoustic scenario and on an
artiﬁcial scenario with truly sparse discrete ﬁlters for reference. For the room-acoustic scenario 
there is a point source emitting speech from the TIMIT dataset [31]  and M = 2 microphones
are randomly placed inside 100 random shoe-box rooms whose sizes vary from 4m × 6m × 8m to
5m × 7m × 9m. Simulations were performed using the pyroomacoustics library [32]. The absorption
coefﬁcient of each surface of the room is set to 0.2. Only ﬁrst-order reﬂections on the 6 surfaces
and the direct path are simulated  resulting in K = 7 echoes per channel and ﬁlters shorter than
50 ms. For each experiment  it was ensured that the minimum separation of echoes was 1ms. The
ﬁlters are simulated in the continuous-time domain using the image-source method [33]. They are
then smoothed  sampled and convolved with the source signal at Fs = 16kHz according to the
measurement model described in Sec. 2.1. The ground-truth echo locations and weights are saved in
the time-domain before smoothing and are hence off-grid. The M-channel input signals used are

7

0.25s long  i.e.  N = 0.25Fs = 4000 samples. On the other hand  for the artiﬁcial scenario  the
speech source was discretely convolved with sparse ﬁlters of similar length with K = 7 nonzero
elements each resulting in N = 4000 samples of M-channel observations. The ground-truth echo
locations and weights are hence on-grid in this case. All weights take values between 0 and 1.
For MULAN  the DFT (eq. 10) is applied to each input signal using a grid F of F = 401 regularly
spaced frequencies between 200 Hz and 2000 Hz. Such a choice of the frequency range avoids
low-frequency bands which are often noisy in real scenario  while focusing on a typical spectral range
for speech  but it can be easily adapted depending on the application. An odd number of frequencies
was chosen  since it has proven to be a good practice [24]. We use 20 random initializations as a
good compromise between global convergence and computational complexity  max_iter= 1000 and
conv_thresh= 0.1%. The two baseline methods chosen are CR [12] as described in (12) and its
LASSO-type extension [16] as described in (13). The ﬁlters lengths L were always set to the true
lengths (which never exceed 0.05Fs) and the sparsity parameter λ for LASSO was manually set to
λ = 10−3  which empirically showed best performance among the choices {10−6  10−5  . . .   102} 
although any value below 10−2 showed similar performance.
We used two distinct metrics to evaluate Dirac location estimation and Dirac weight estimation. For
the ﬁrst one  a test is counted as successful if the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the 7 × 2 = 14
Dirac locations is below 1 sample (1/Fs seconds)  and the success rate out of 100 tests is provided.
This metric only counts fully successful channel recovery and penalizes tests where some Diracs
are missed or completely off. For the second one  we provide the weight RMSE of successful tests
only. This is to avoid counting weights estimated at wrong Dirac locations. These metrics for 100 on-
and off-grid tests and all three methods are showed in Table 1. We can see that for the on-grid case 
both CR and MULAN perform well  CR even achieving more location recoveries than MULAN.
This is not too surprising since CR is based on the on-grid artiﬁcial model  while MULAN uses an
off-grid model. We observed that LASSO struggles with the proximity of Diracs and did not perform
as well. In terms of weight estimation MULAN yields errors which are 2 to 3 orders of magnitudes
smaller than the two competing methods  which is very encouraging. In the more realistic off-grid
scenario  we observed that localization errors of CR and LASSO drastically degrades with almost no
successful channel estimation. Meanwhile  MULAN achieves near-exact full recovery of locations
and weights in 70 out of 100 tests.

4.2

Inﬂuence of K  M  F on recovery rate

We now conduct further experiments to check the inﬂuence of parameters K  M and F on the ability
of MULAN to fully recover Dirac locations and weights off-grid. We show results with 20 random
initializations  F = 201 or F = 401 in the same frequency range as before  M ∈ {2  . . .   7} and
K ∈ {2  . . .   7}. The following RMSE thresholds were deﬁned for success of recovery: 1 sample
for locations as before and 10−2 for weights. 100 experiments were performed for every parameter
set. Results for F = 201 can be seen in Figures 2 and 3  and for F = 401 in Figures 4 and 5. As
can be seen  a higher recovery rate is generally observed when fewer echoes are present and more
frequencies are used. On the other hand  the number of sensors does not signiﬁcantly affect recovery
performance. This is expected since O(KM ) parameters are estimated from O(M F ) observations.
Increasing the number of random initializations also showed to increase success by alleviating the
non-convexity of the problem  at the cost of an increased computational requirement.

5 Conclusion

This paper introduced the ﬁrst method enabling blind and off-grid recovery of echo locations and
weights from discrete-time multichannel measurements  to the best of the authors’ knowledge. Future
work will include alternative initialization schemes and convex relaxations in the spirit of [22] for
the proposed cost function  extensions to sparse-spectrum signals and noisy measurements  and
applications to dereverberation and audio-based room shape reconstruction. A better theoretical
understanding of recovery guarantees as a function of M  K  F and N will also be sought. The code
