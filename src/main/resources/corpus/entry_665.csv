Abstract

The restricted isometry property (RIP) for design matrices gives guarantees for
optimal recovery in sparse linear models.
It is of high interest in compressed
sensing and statistical learning. This property is particularly important for com-
putationally efﬁcient recovery methods. As a consequence  even though it is in
general NP-hard to check that RIP holds  there have been substantial efforts to
ﬁnd tractable proxies for it. These would allow the construction of RIP matrices
and the polynomial-time veriﬁcation of RIP given an arbitrary matrix. We con-
sider the framework of average-case certiﬁers  that never wrongly declare that a
matrix is RIP  while being often correct for random instances. While there are
such functions which are tractable in a suboptimal parameter regime  we show
that this is a computationally hard task in any better regime. Our results are based
on a new  weaker assumption on the problem of detecting dense subgraphs.

Introduction

In many areas of data science  high-dimensional signals contain rich structure. It is of great in-
terest to leverage this structure to improve our ability to describe characteristics of the signal and
to make future predictions. Sparsity is a structure of wide applicability (see  e.g. Mallat  1999;
Rauhut and Foucart  2013; Eldar and Kutyniok  2012)  with a broad literature dedicated to its study
in various scientiﬁc ﬁelds.
The sparse linear model takes the form y = Xβ + ε  where y ∈ Rn is a vector of observations 
X ∈ Rn×p is a design matrix  ε ∈ Rn is noise  and the vector β ∈ Rp is assumed to have a
small number k of non-zero entries. Estimating β or the mean response  Xβ  are among the most
widely studied problems in signal processing  as well as in statistical learning. In high-dimensional
problems  one would wish to recover β with as few observations as possible. For an incoherent
design matrix  it is known that an order of k2 observations sufﬁce (Donoho  Elad and Temlyakov 
2006; Donoho and Elad  2003). However  this appears to require a number of observations far
exceeding the information content of β  which has only k variables  albeit with unknown locations.
This dependence in k can be greatly improved by using design matrices that are almost isometries
on some low dimensional subspaces  i.e.  matrices that satisfy the restricted isometry property with
parameters k and θ  or RIP(k  θ) (see Deﬁnition 1.1). It is a highly robust property  and in fact
implies that many different polynomial time methods  such as greedy methods (Blumensath and
Davies  2009; Needell and Tropp  2009; Dai and Milenkovic  2009) and convex optimization (Can-
dès  2008; Candès  Romberg and Tao  2006b; Candès and Tao  2005)  are stable in recovering β.

Random matrices are known to satisfy the RIP when the number n of observation is more than about
k log(p)/θ2. These results were developed in the ﬁeld of compressed sensing (Candès  Romberg and
Tao  2006a; Donoho  2006; Rauhut and Foucart  2013; Eldar and Kutyniok  2012) where the use of
randomness still remains pivotal for near-optimal results. Properties related to the conditioning of
design matrices have also been shown to play a key role in the statistical properties of computa-
tionally efﬁcient estimators of β (Zhang  Wainwright and Jordan  2014). While the assumption of
randomness allows great theoretical leaps  it leaves open questions for practitioners.
Scientists working on data closely following this model cannot always choose their design matrix
X  or at least choose one that is completely random. Moreover  it is in general practically impos-
sible to check that a given matrix satisﬁes these desired properties  as RIP certiﬁcation is NP-hard
(Bandeira et al.  2012). Having access to a function  or statistic  of X that could be easily computed 
which determines how well β may be estimated  would therefore be of a great help. The search
for such statistics has been of great importance for over a decade now  and several have been pro-
posed (d’Aspremont and El Ghaoui  2011; Lee and Bresler  2008; Juditsky and Nemirovski  2011;
d’Aspremont  Bach and El Ghaoui  2008). Perhaps the simplest and most popular is the incoherence
parameter  which measures the maximum inner product between distinct  normalized  columns of
X. However  all of these are known to necessarily fail to guarantee good recovery when p ≥ 2n
unless n is of order k2 (d’Aspremont and El Ghaoui  2011). Given a speciﬁc problem instance  the
strong recovery guarantees of compressed sensing cannot be veriﬁed based on these statistics.
In this article  we study the problem of average-case certiﬁcation of the Restricted Isometry Property
(RIP). A certiﬁer takes as input a design matrix X  always outputs ‘false’ when X does not satisfy
the property  and outputs ‘true’ for a large proportion of matrices (see Deﬁnition 2.1). Indeed  worst-
case hardness does not preclude a problem from being solvable for most instances. The link between
restricted isometry and incoherence implies that polynomial time certiﬁers exists in a regime where
n is of order k2 log(p)/θ2. It is natural to ask whether the RIP can be certiﬁed for sample size
n (cid:29) k log(p)/θ2  where most matrices (with respect to  say  the Gaussian measure) are RIP. If it
does  it would also provide a Las Vegas algorithm to construct RIP design matrices of optimal sizes.
This should be compared with the currently existing limitations for the deterministic construction of
RIP matrices.
Our main result is that certiﬁcation in this sense is hard even in a near-optimal regime  assuming a
new  weaker assumption on detecting dense subgraphs  related to the Planted Clique hypothesis.
Theorem (Informal). For any α < 1  there is no computationally efﬁcient  average-case certiﬁer
for the class RIPn p(k  θ) uniformly over an asymptotic regime where n (cid:28) k1+α/θ2.
This suggests that even in the average case  RIP certiﬁcation requires almost k2 log(p)/θ2 observa-
tions. This contrasts highly with the fact that a random matrix satisﬁes RIP with high probability
when n exceeds about k log(p)/θ2. Thus  there appears to be a large gap between what a practitioner
may be able to certify given a speciﬁc problem instance  and what holds for a random matrix.On the
other hand  if a certiﬁer is found which ﬁlls this gap  the result would not only have huge practical
implications in compressed sensing and statistical learning  but would also disprove a long-standing
conjecture from computational complexity theory.
We focus solely on the restricted isometry property  but other conditions under which compressed
sensing is possible are also known. Extending our results to the restricted eigenvalue condition
Bickel  Ritov and Tsybakov (2009) or other conditions (see  van de Geer and Buhlmann  2009  and
references therein) is an interesting path for future research.
Our result shares many characteristics with a hypothesis by Feige (2002) on the hardness of refuting
random satisﬁability formulas. Indeed  our statement is also about the hardness of verifying that
a property holds for a particular instance (RIP for design matrices  instead of unsatisﬁability for
boolean formulas). It concerns a regime where such a property should hold with high probability (n
of order k1+α/θ2  linear regime for satisﬁability)  cautiously allowing only one type of errors  false
negatives  for a problem that is hard in the worst case. In these two examples  such certiﬁers exist in
a sub-optimal regime. Our problem is conceptually different from results regarding the worst-case
hardness of certifying this property (see  e.g. Bandeira et al.  2012; Koiran and Zouzias  2012; Till-
mann and Pfetsch  2014). It is closer to another line of work concerned with computational lower
bounds for statistical learning problems based on average-case assumptions. The planted clique
assumption has been used to prove computational hardness results for statistical problems such as
estimation and testing of sparse principal components (Berthet and Rigollet  2013a b; Wang  Berthet

2

and Samworth  2016)  testing and localization of submatrix signals (Ma and Wu  2013; Chen and
Xu  2014)  community detection (Hajek  Wu and Xu  2015) and sparse canonical correlation anal-
ysis (Gao  Ma and Zhou  2014). The intractability of noisy parity recovery problem (Blum  Kalai
and Wasserman  2003) has also been used recently as an average-case assumption to deduce com-
putational hardness of detection of satisﬁability formulas with lightly planted solutions (Berthet and
Ellenberg  2015). Additionally  several unconditional computational hardness results are shown for
statistical problems under constraints of learning models (Feldman et al.  2013). The present work
has two main differences compared to previous computational lower bound results. First  in a de-
tection setting  these lower bounds concern two speciﬁc distributions (for the null and alternative
hypothesis)  while ours is valid for all sub-Gaussian distributions  and there is no alternative distri-
bution. Secondly  our result is not based on the usual assumption for the Planted Clique problem.
Instead  we use a weaker assumption on a problem of detecting planted dense graphs. This does
not mean that the planted graph is a random graph with edge probability q > 1/2 as considered
in (Arias-Castro and Verzelen  2013; Bhaskara et al.  2010; Awasthi et al.  2015)  but that it can be
any graph with an unexpectedly high number of edges (see section 3.1). This choice is made to
strengthen our result: it would ‘survive’ the discovery of an algorithm that would use very speciﬁc
properties of cliques (or even of random dense graphs) to detect their presence. As a consequence 
the analysis of our reduction is more technically complicated.
Our work is organized in the following manner: We recall in Section 1 the deﬁnition of the restricted
isometry property  and some of its known properties. In Section 2  we deﬁne the notion of certiﬁer 
and prove the existence of a computationally efﬁcient certiﬁer in a sub-optimal regime. Our main
result is developed in Section 3  focused on the hardness of average-case certiﬁcation. The proofs
of the main results are in Appendix A of the supplementary material and those of auxiliary results
in Appendix B of the the supplementary material.

1 Restricted Isometric Property

1.1 Formulation

We use the deﬁnition of Candès and Tao (2005)  who introduced this notion. Below  for a vector
u ∈ Rp  we deﬁne (cid:107)u(cid:107)0 is the number of its non-zero entries.
Deﬁnition (RIP). A matrix X ∈ Rn×p satisﬁes the restricted isometry property with sparsity k ∈
{1  . . .   p} and distortion θ ∈ (0  1)  denoted by X ∈ RIPn p(k  θ)  if it holds that

1 − θ ≤ (cid:107)Xu(cid:107)2

2 ≤ 1 + θ 

for every u ∈ Sp−1(k) := {u ∈ Rp : (cid:107)u(cid:107)2 = 1 (cid:107)u(cid:107)0 ≤ k}.
This can be equivalently deﬁned by a property on submatrices of the design matrix: X is in
RIPn p(k  θ) if and only if for any set S of k columns of X  the submatrix  X∗S  formed by taking
any these columns is almost an isometry  i.e. if the spectrum of its Gram matrix is contained in the
interval [1 − θ  1 + θ]:

Denote by (cid:107) · (cid:107)op k the k-sparse operator norm  deﬁned for a matrix A as (cid:107)A(cid:107)op k =
supx∈Sp−1(k) (cid:107)Ax(cid:107)2. This yields another equivalent formulation of the RIP property: X ∈
RIPn p(k  θ) if and only if

(cid:107)X(cid:62)

∗SX∗S − Ik(cid:107)op ≤ θ .

(cid:107)X(cid:62)X − Ip(cid:107)op k ≤ θ .

We assume in the following discussion that the distortion parameter θ is upper-bounded by 1. For
v ∈ Rp and T ⊆ {1  . . .   p}  we write vT for the #T -dimensional vector obtained by restricting
v to coordinates indexed by T . Similarly  for an n × p matrix A and subsets S ⊆ {1  . . .   n} and
T ⊆ {1  . . .   p}  we write AS∗ for the submatrix obtained by restricting A to rows indexed by S 
A∗T for the submatrix obtained by restricting A to columns indexed by T .

1.2 Generation via random design

Matrices that satisfy the restricted isometry property have many interesting applications in high-
dimensional statistics and compressed sensing. However  there is no known way to generate them

It is even NP-hard to check whether a given matrix X belongs to

√
RIPn p(k  θ) (see  e.g Bandeira et al.  2012). Several deterministic constructions of RIP matrices
exist for sparsity level k (cid:46) θ
circle theorem  one can construct RIP matrices with sparsity k ≤ √
n. For example  using equitriangular tight frames and Gershgorin’s
√
n and distortion θ bounded
away from 0 (see  e.g. Bandeira et al.  2012). The limitation k ≤ θ
n is known as the ‘square
root bottleneck’. To date  the only constructions that break the ‘square root bottleneck’ are due to
Bourgain et al. (2011) and Bandeira  Mixon and Moreira (2014)  both of which give RIP guarantee
for k of order n1/2+ for some small  > 0 and ﬁxed θ (the latter construction is conditional on a
number-theoretic conjecture being true).
Interestingly though  it is easy to generate large matrices satisfying the restricted isometry property
through random design  and compared to the ﬁxed design matrices mentioned in the previous para-
graph  these random design constructions are much less restrictive on the sparsity level  typically
allowing k up to the order n/ log(p) (assuming θ is bounded away from zero). They can be con-
structed easily from any centred sub-Gaussian distribution. We recall that a distribution Q (and its
R eλx dQ(x) ≤ eλ2σ2/2
for all λ ∈ R.
Deﬁnition. Deﬁne Q = Qσ to be the set of sub-Gaussian distributions Q over R with zero mean 
unit variance  and sub-Gaussian parameter at most σ.
The most common choice for a Q ∈ Q is the standard normal distribution N (0  1). Note that by
R x2 dQ(x) = 1. In the rest of the
√
paper  we treat σ as ﬁxed. Deﬁne the normalized distribution ˜Q to be the distribution of Z/
n for
Z ∼ Q. The following well-known result states that by concentration of measure  random matrices
generated with distribution ˜Q⊗(n×p) satisfy restricted isometries (see  e.g. Candès and Tao (2005)
and Baraniuk et al. (2008)). For completeness  we include a proof that establishes these particular
constants stated here. All proofs are deferred to Appendix A or Appendix B of the supplementary
material.

2 Certiﬁcation of Restricted Isometry

2.1 Objectives and deﬁnition

In practice  it is useful to know with certainty whether a particular realization of a random design
matrix satisﬁes the RIP condition. It is known that the problem of deciding if a given matrix is RIP
is NP-hard (Bandeira et al.  2012). However  NP-hardness is a only a statement about worst-case
instances. It would still be of great use to have an algorithm that can correctly decide RIP property
for an average instance of a design matrix  with some accuracy. Such an algorithm should identify a
high proportion of RIP matrices generated through random design and make no false positive claims.
We call such an algorithm an average-case certiﬁer  or a certiﬁer for short.
Deﬁnition (Certiﬁer). Given a parameter sequence (p  k  θ) = (pn  kn  θn)  we deﬁne a certiﬁer for
˜Q⊗(n×p)-random matrices to be a sequence (ψn)n of measurable functions ψn : Rn×p → {0  1} 
such that

˜Q⊗(n×p)(cid:0)ψ−1

n (0)(cid:1) ≤ 1/3.

and

Note the deﬁnition of a certiﬁer depends on both the asymptotic parameter sequence (pn  kn  θn) and
the sub-Gaussian distribution Q. However  when it is clear from the context  we will suppress the
dependence and refer to certiﬁers for RIPn p(k  θ) properties of ˜Q⊗(n×p)-random matrices simply
as ‘certiﬁers’.
The two deﬁning properties in (2) can be understood as follows. The ﬁrst condition means that if a
certiﬁer outputs 1  we know with certainty that the matrix is RIP. The second condition means that
the certiﬁer is not overly conservative; it is allowed to output 0 for at most one third (with respect
to ˜Q⊗(n×p) measure) of the matrices. The choice of 1/3 in the deﬁnition of a certiﬁer is made to
simplify proofs. However  all subsequent results will still hold if we replace 1/3 by any constant in
(0  1). In view of Proposition 1  the second condition in (2) can be equivalently stated as

˜Q⊗(n×p)(cid:8)ψn(X) = 1(cid:12)(cid:12) X ∈ RIPn p(k  θ)(cid:9) ≥ 2/3.

lim inf
n→∞

With such a certiﬁer  given an arbitrary problem ﬁtting the sparse linear model  the matrix X could
be tested for the restricted isometry property  with some expectation of a positive result. This would
be particularly interesting given a certiﬁer in the parameter regime n (cid:28) θ2
n  in which presently
known polynomial-time certiﬁers cannot give positive results.
Even though it is not the main focus of our paper  we also note that a certiﬁer ψ with the above
properties for some distribution Q ∈ Q would form a certiﬁer/distribution couple (ψ  Q)  that yields
in the usual manner a Las Vegas algorithm to generate RIP matrices. The (random) algorithm keeps
generating random matrices X ∼ ˜Q⊗(n×p) until ψn(X) = 1. The number of times that the certiﬁer

is invoked has a geometric distribution with success probability ˜Q⊗(n×p)(cid:0)ψ−1

n (1)(cid:1). Hence  the

Las Vegas algorithm runs in randomized polynomial time if and only if ψn runs in randomized
polynomial time.

2.2 Certiﬁer properties

Although our focus is on algorithmically efﬁcient certiﬁers  we establish ﬁrst the properties of a
certiﬁer that is computationally intractable. This certiﬁer serves as a benchmark for the performance
of other candidates. Indeed  we exhibit in the following proposition a certiﬁer  based on the k-sparse
operator norm  that works uniformly well in the same asymptotic parameter regime R0  where
˜Q⊗(n×p)-random matrices are RIP with asymptotic probability 1. For clarity  we stress that our
criterion when judging a certiﬁer will always be its uniform performance over asymptotic regimes
Rα for some α ∈ [0  1].
Proposition 2. Suppose (p  k  θ) = (pn  kn  θn) ∈ R0. Furthermore  Let Q ∈ Q and X ∼
˜Q⊗(n×p). Then the sequence of tests (ψop k)n based on sparse operator norms  deﬁned by

(cid:26)

(cid:27)

(cid:107)X(cid:62)X − Ip(cid:107)op k ≤ θ

.

ψop k(X) := 1

is a certiﬁer for ˜Q⊗(n×p)-random matrices.

By a direct reduction from the clique problem  one can show that it is NP-hard to compute the k-
sparse operator norm of a matrix. Hence the certiﬁer ψop k is computationally intractable. The next
proposition concerns the certiﬁer property of a test based on the maximum incoherence between
columns of the design matrix.
It follows directly from a well-known result on the incoherence
parameter of a random matrix (see  e.g. Rauhut and Foucart (2013  Proposition 6.2)) and allows the
construction of a polynomial-time certiﬁer that works uniformly well in the asymptotic parameter
regime R1.
Proposition 3. Suppose (p  k  θ) = (pn  kn  θn) satisﬁes n ≥ 196σ4k2 log(p)/θ2. Let Q ∈ Q and
X ∼ ˜Q⊗(n×p)  then the tests ψ∞ deﬁned by

is a certiﬁer for ˜Q⊗(n×p)-random matrices.

Proposition 3 shows that  when the sample size n is above k2 log(p)/θ2 in magnitude (in particular 
this is satisﬁed asymptotically when (p  k  θ) = (pn  kn  θn) ∈ R1)  there is a polynomial time
certiﬁer.
In other words  in this high-signal regime  the average-case decision problem for RIP
property is much more tractable than indicated by the worst-case result. On the other hand  the
certiﬁer in Proposition 3 works in a much smaller parameter range when compared to ψop k in
Proposition 2. Combining Proposition 2 and 3  we have the following schematic diagram (Figure 1).
When the sample size is lower than speciﬁed in R0  the property does not hold  with high probability 
and no certiﬁer exists. A computationally intractable certiﬁer works uniformly over R0. On the other
end of the spectrum  when the sample size is large enough to be in R1  a simple certiﬁer based on
the maximum incoherence of the design matrix is known to work in polynomial time. This leaves
open the question of whether (randomized) polynomial time certiﬁers can work uniformly well in
R0  or Rα for any α ∈ [0  1). We will see in the next section that  assuming a weaker variant of
the Planted Clique hypothesis from computational complexity theory  R1 is essentially the largest
asymptotic regime where a randomized polynomial time certiﬁer can exist.

3 Hardness of Certiﬁcation

3.1 Planted dense subgraph assumptions

We show in this section that certiﬁcation of RIP property is an average-case hard problem in the
parameter regime Rα for any α < 1. This is precisely the regime not covered by Proposition 3. The
average-case hardness result is proved via reduction to the planted dense subgraph assumption.
For any integer m ≥ 0  denote Gm the collection of all graphs on m vertices. We write V (G)
and E(G) for the set of vertices and edges of a graph G. For H ∈ Gκ where κ ∈ {0  . . .   m}  let
G(m  1/2  H) be the random graph model that generates a random graph G on m vertices as follows.
It ﬁrst picks κ random vertices K ⊆ V (G) and plants an isomorphic copy of H on these κ vertices 
then every pair of vertices not in K × K is connected by an edge independently with probability
1/2. We write PH for the probability measure on Gm associated with G(m  1/2  H). Note that if H
is the empty graph  then G(m  1/2 ∅) describes the Erd˝os–Rényi random graph. With a slight abuse
of notation  we write P0 in place of P∅. On the other hand  for  ∈ (0  1/2]  if H belongs to the set

H = Hκ  :=

H ∈ Gκ : #E(H) ≥ (1/2 + )

and

then G(m  1/2  H) generates random graphs that contain elevated local edge density. The planted
dense graph problem concerns testing apart the following two hypotheses:

H0 : G ∼ G(m  1/2 ∅)

H1 : G ∼ G(m  1/2  H) for some H ∈ Hκ .

(3)
It is widely believed that for κ = O(m1/2−δ)  there does not exist randomized polynomial time
tests to distinguish between H0 and H1 (see  e.g. Jerrum (1992); Feige and Krauthgamer (2003);
Feldman et al. (2013)). More precisely  we have the following assumption.
Assumption (A1) 1. Fix  ∈ (0  1/2] and δ ∈ (0  1/2).

such that κm → ∞ and κm = O(cid:0)m1/2−δ(cid:1). For any sequence of randomized polynomial time tests

We remark that if  = 1/2  then Hκ  contains only the κ-complete graph and the testing problem
becomes the well-known planted clique problem (cf. Jerrum (1992) and references in Berthet and
Rigollet (2013a b)).
The difﬁculty of this problem has been used as a primitive for the hardness of other tasks  such
as cryptographic applications  in Juels and Peinado (2000)  testing for k-wise dependence in Alon
et al. (2007)  approximating Nash equilibria in Hazan and Krauthgamer (2011). In this case  As-
sumption (A1) is a version of the planted clique hypothesis (see  e.g. Berthet and Rigollet (2013b 
Assumption APC)). We emphasize that Assumption A1 is signiﬁcantly milder than the planted
clique hypothesis (since it allows any  ∈ (0  1/2])  or that a hypothesis on planted random graphs.
We also note that when κ ≥ C
m  spectral methods can be used to detect such graphs with
high probability. Indeed  when G contains a graph of H  denoting AG its adjacency matrix  then
AG − 11(cid:62)/2 has a leading eigenvalue greater than (κ − 1)  whereas it is of order
m for a usual
Erd˝os–Rényi random graph.
The following theorem relates the hardness of the planted dense subgraph testing problem to the
hardness of certifying restricted isometry of random matrices. We recall that the distribution of X is
√
that of an n×p random matrix with entries independently and identically sampled from ˜Q d= Q/
n 
for some Q ∈ Q. We also write Ψrp for the class of randomized polynomial time certiﬁers.

Theorem 4. Assume (A1) and ﬁx any α ∈ [0  1). Then there exists a sequence (p  k  θ) =
(pn  kn  θn) ∈ Rα  such that there is no certiﬁer/distribution couple (ψ  Q) ∈ Ψrp ×Q with respect
to this sequence of parameters.

Our proof of Theorem 4 relies on the following ideas: Given a graph G  an instance of the planted
clique problem in the assumed hard regime  we construct n random vectors based on the adjacency
matrix of a bipartite subgraph of G  between two random sets of vertices. Each coefﬁcient of these
vectors is then randomly drawn from one of two carefully chosen distributions  conditionally on the
presence or absence of a particular edge. This construction ensures that if the graph is an Erd˝os–
Rényi random graph (i.e. with no planted graph)  the vectors are independent with independent
coefﬁcients  with distribution ˜Q. Otherwise  we show that with high probability  the presence of an
unusually dense subgraph will make it very likely that the matrix does not satisfy the restricted isom-
etry property  for a set of parameters in Rα. As a consequence  if there existed a certiﬁer/distribution
couple (ψ  Q) ∈ Ψrp × Q in this range of parameters  it could be used - by using as input in the
certiﬁer the newly constructed matrix - to determine with high probability the distribution of G 
violating our assumption (A1).
We remark that this result holds for any distribution in Q  in contrast to computational lower bounds
in statistical learning problems  that apply to a speciﬁc distribution. For the sake of simplicity  we
have kept the coefﬁcients of X identically distributed  but our analysis is not dependent on that
fact  and our result can be directly extended to the case where the coefﬁcients are independent  with
different distributions in Q.
Theorem 4 may be viewed as providing an asymptotic lower bound of the sample size n for the
existence of a computationally feasible certiﬁer. It establishes this computational lower bound by
exhibiting some speciﬁc ‘hard’ sequences of parameters inside Rα  and show that any algorithm
violating the computational lower bound could be exploited to solve the planted dense subgraph
problem. All hardness results  whether in a worst-case (NP-hardness  or other) or the average-case
(by reduction from a hard problem)  are by nature statements on the impossibility of accomplishing a
task in a computationally efﬁcient manner  uniformly over a range of parameters. They are therefore
always based on the construction of a ‘hard’ sequence of parameters used in the reduction  for
which a contradiction is shown. Here  the ‘hard’ sequence is explicitly constructed in the proof
to be some (p  k  θ) = (pn  kn  θn) satisfying p ≥ n and n1/(3−α−4β) (cid:28) k (cid:28) n1/(2−β)−δ  for
β ∈ [0  (1 − α)/3) and any small δ > 0. The tuning parameter β is to allow additional ﬂexibility
in choosing these ‘hard’ sequences. More precisely  using an averaging trick ﬁrst seen in Ma and
Wu (2013)  we are able to show that the existence of such ‘hard’ sequences is not conﬁned only in
the sparsity regime k (cid:28) n1/2 . We note that in all our ‘hard’ sequences  θn must depend on n. An
interesting extension is to see if similar computational lower bounds hold when restricted to a subset
of Rα where θ is constant.
