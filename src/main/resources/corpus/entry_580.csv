Abstract

Building an open-domain conversational agent is a challenging problem. Current
evaluation methods  mostly post-hoc judgments of static conversation  do not
capture conversation quality in a realistic interactive context. In this paper  we
investigate interactive human evaluation and provide evidence for its necessity; we
then introduce a novel  model-agnostic  and dataset-agnostic method to approxi-
mate it. In particular  we propose a self-play scenario where the dialog system talks
to itself and we calculate a combination of proxies such as sentiment and semantic
coherence on the conversation trajectory. We show that this metric is capable of
capturing the human-rated quality of a dialog model better than any automated
metric known to-date  achieving a signiﬁcant Pearson correlation (r > .7  p < .05).
To investigate the strengths of this novel metric and interactive evaluation in com-
parison to state-of-the-art metrics and human evaluation of static conversations  we
perform extended experiments with a set of models  including several that make
novel improvements to recent hierarchical dialog generation architectures through
sentiment and semantic knowledge distillation on the utterance level. Finally 
we open-source the interactive evaluation platform we built and the dataset we
collected to allow researchers to efﬁciently deploy and evaluate dialog models.

Introduction

The goal of an open-domain conversational agent is to carry out natural social interactions with
humans. Current state-of-the-art generative neural networks fail in producing key aspects of good
natural conversation  including staying on topic  not being repetitive  and generating emotionally
appropriate responses. One of the biggest challenges in training better dialog systems relates to
the difﬁculty of evaluating them. Automatic metrics such as BLEU score relate poorly to human
judgment of dialog quality [1]  and while embedding-distance based metrics provide an alternative
[2]  we will show that they also do not correlate well with human evaluation. Without a reliable
metric to optimize  training high quality dialog models remains difﬁcult.
Since humans are the ultimate authority on what constitutes a good conversation  many authors rely
on human ratings to evaluate their methods [3–5]. The predominant procedure for obtaining human
ratings uses static evaluation: a context of several sentences  often originating from the dataset that
dialog model was trained on  is used as input to generate a response (either a single utterance or
multiple consecutive utterances). This particular generated response for this particular context is then
provided for a human to evaluate. However  such observational evaluation of a static text sample

Table 1: Static evaluation fails to capture a lack of diversity in a dialog model’s responses  as well as its inability
to track the conversation and respond in emotionally appropriate ways. We argue interactive evaluation is needed
to evaluate dialog models  and show that our Emotion+Infersent (EI) models trained on a larger and more diverse
corpus  produce better interactive dialog. We present strong evidence that our novel dialog self-play framework
combined with psychologically motivated novel automated metrics can accurately estimate quality of a model
with respect to its ability to carry out multi-turn open-domain conversations.

is limited in capturing common failure modes of open-domain dialog systems  such as a lack of
diversity in the responses  inability to track long-term aspects of the conversation  and inability to
maintain a consistent persona [6]. Despite this  static evaluation is commonly used for evaluating
these exact qualities [7  8].
Conversation is inherently a process. In this paper  we argue that multi-turn interactive human
evaluation is essential for evaluating this process  and for making progress in improving open-domain
dialog models. A multi-turn interactive evaluation is open-ended  and allows the users to derive and
control the trajectory of the conversation by saying whatever they want. As opposed to post-hoc
observations of a generated response to a static context  this is an ultimate test of generalization. Table
1 illustrates an example where a bot generates a coherent static response  but interactive evaluation
shows that the distribution of its responses has collapsed onto repeatedly saying the same phrase  a
common problem in open domain dialog [9].
The relative sparsity of interactive human evaluation of dialog systems may relate to the difﬁculty
and expense of collecting human data. Therefore  we develop a way to approximate human judgment
of interactive dialog quality using a novel form of dialog self-play. We begin by moving beyond
superﬁcial word-level mapping by proposing a series of metrics to evaluate the quality of conversation
motivated by ﬁndings in psychology. Speciﬁcally  inspired by the effectiveness of sense of humor
in creating solidarity [10]  style matching for forming relationship stability and social cohesiveness
[11  12]  and the importance of active listening through forming follow up questions [13]  we propose
metrics to capture sentiment  semantics  and user engagement. We then ﬁt a function that predicts
human assessments of conversation quality given these metrics. This function is used to predict bot
quality through self-play: for a ﬁxed number of turns  the bot generates utterances which are fed back
into itself as input in the next turn. The same metrics described above are computed on the self-play
generated conversation  and the same function ﬁt to human data is used to predict the bot quality. We
show a very high Pearson correlation (r > .7  p < .05) between the predicted quality scores and the
ground-truth human judgments of bot quality  suggesting self-play is a good proxy for interactive
conversation assessment.
To demonstrate the relevance of the interactive evaluation and the proposed self-play evaluation  we
perform extended experiments with different hierarchical architectures. In particular  we compare
three recent hierarchical baselines: HRED [5]  VHRED [3]  VHCR [4]. Motivated by sentiment and
semantics being key aspects of producing high quality conversations  we regularize the top level of
the hierarchy to ensure it encodes such information  using model distillation [14]. Our results show
the effectiveness of the proposed regularization in interactive evaluation in both the human-bot and
the self-play scenarios.
This paper makes three main contributions: 1) demonstrates the necessity of multi-turn interactive
evaluation to capture the quality of the dialog systems; 2) presents a novel self-play framework to
estimate a new psychology-motivated hybrid quality score. These estimations are highly correlated
with quality scores obtained from interactive human evaluation  more strongly than the state-of-the-
art automated metrics; 3) proposes a new method of regularizing hierarchical seq2seq models with
knowledge distillation. All the code  data  and interactive evaluation platform resulting from our
work are publicly available.

2 Related work

Interactive evaluation in dialog has been mostly limited to presenting the results of competitions
(e.g. the Alexa prize [15  16]  or the Conversational Intelligence Challenge [6]). Those ﬁndings
reveal that most bots do not perform well in interactive evaluation  due to repetitiveness  inability to
balance dialog acts across the conversation  and inability to maintain a consistent persona [6]. Even
work aimed at maintaining a persona does not test in an interactive setting [7  8]. To the best of our
knowledge  no prior work has compared multi-turn  interactive human evaluations of open-domain
dialog models to traditional forms of evaluation.
Dialog systems remain difﬁcult to train due to the lack of metrics that can effectively capture good
dialog quality. Several authors have proposed training automatic predictors of human judgment or to
combine human judgment with automatic metrics [17–19]. However  a state-of-the-art model trained
to predict human judgments achieved a Pearson correlation of .44 with the ground truth [18].
Perhaps the lack of research into interactive evaluation relates to the difﬁculty and cost of collecting
human ratings. We show that human judgments of the quality of an interactive evaluation can
be automatically and reliably approximated using dialog model self-play. There is limited work
investigating self-play for dialog systems: Shah et al. [20] use a task schema and user simulator to
generate samples for input to a goal-directed dialog system  while Li et al. [9] use a copy of a dialog
model to compute a reward function that can be optimized with reinforcement learning. However  we
are not aware of prior work using self-play for approximating interactive human evaluation.
Interactive conversation necessitates tracking long-term aspects of the dialog like the topic and tone.
Hierarchical recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been proposed as a way to improve long-term
tracking of the conversation  through maintaining both a word- and utterance-level RNN [3–5  21  22].
Yet dialog is more than language modeling  it requires topic and social coherence. Prior performance
improvements to dialog models using topic information include appending topic as an additional
input [23]  or extracting topic information using Latent Dirichlet Allocation [24  25]. Towards social
and emotional coherence  previous works have investigated various features and loss functions based
on emotion [26–30]. Given research highlighting the ineffectiveness of LDA for short texts [31] 
such as those involved in casual conversation  and the unavailability of topic and tone supervision
at-scale  approaches overcoming these limitations are preferred. To the best of our knowledge 
transferring sentiment and semantic information from a pre-trained model directly into a dialog model
using knowledge distillation [14] has not been studied. Thus  we select a set of recent hierarchical
dialog models and their improved versions through knowledge distillation for a thorough multi-turn
interactive evaluation and comparison to traditional evaluation.

3 Knowledge distillation for sentiment and semantic regularization

To systematically compare multi-turn interactive evaluation of open-domain dialog with traditional
forms of evaluation  we include a diverse set of models. Particularly  we build on three existing
hierarchical seq2seq architectures designed for dialog. Here  we provide a brief summary; for detailed
information  see [5  3  4]. The ﬁrst baseline model  Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder Decoder (HRED)
[5] extends a traditional seq2seq model by adding a third recurrent neural network (RNN)  which
is only updated after each dialog turn  or utterance. The idea behind this Context RNN is that it
could potentially track longer term aspects of the conversation  such as the topic; however  there is
no guarantee that it will learn to do so. The decoder of the HRED model conditions on both the
embedding produced by the encoder for the current utterance  he
n  and the embedding of the Context
RNN for the previous utterance  hc
The second baseline model  Variational HRED (VHRED) [3]  extends HRED with a variational
constraint on the utterance embedding space z. Let xn = [w1n  w2n . . . wmn] be the n-th utterance
composed of tokens w1..m. VHRED predicts xn as follows:
he
n = f e(xn−1)
hc
n−1 = f c(xn−1  he

Figure 1: Illustration of the EI regularization (blue-solid) applied to VHRED baseline (red-checkered)
to enforce encoding sentiment and semantics of an utterance in the Context RNN. The EI regulariza-
tion can be similarly applied to HRED and VHCR.

Equations (1)-(5) describe the computation of VHRED at inference time where f e  f c  and f d are
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks for the encoder  context  and decoder RNNs  respectively;
at training time  it allows the computation of z  µ  and Σ to condition on the encoding of the target
n  giving the posterior distribution pΨ(zn|x≤n). A Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
utterance  he
constraint is placed between the posterior and prior  DKL(pΨ||pθ).
The third model  Variational Hierarchical Conversation RNN (VHCR) [4] further extends VHRED
by drawing a prior encoding zconv ∼ N (0  I) for each conversation  allowing all parts of the model
(f c  µ  Σ) to condition on zconv  which is unchanging throughout the conversation.

3.1 Emotion and Infersent regularization (EI)

While the hierarchical design of these models is motivated by a desire to allow tracking high-level 
slow-changing aspects of the conversation like topic or tone  it is unclear that the network will be able
to model these aspects without additional structure or information. We thus propose a regularization
to the top level of the hierarchy  the Context RNN  to force it to encode both the sentiment and
semantics of the utterance. To do this  we leverage a state-of-the-art sentiment detection model
trained on a large Twitter corpus [32]  as well as the recently proposed Infersent sentence-embedding
model trained to predict the meaning (i.e. entailment  contradiction) of sentences [33]  and distill
them into the Context RNN.
First  we use these models to predict the emotional content  fE(xn)  and infersent embedding 
fI (xn) of each input utterance. We then add an additional network to the hierarchical models
which predicts these values based on the context RNN embedding of the utterance: f distill(hc
n) =
< fE(xn)  fI (xn) >. The goal is to transfer knowledge of emotion and semantics in text into the
context RNN via knowledge distillation [14].
Figure 1 illustrates  in blue color  the EI regularization applied to the VHRED model. The
regularization can be similarly applied to HRED and VHCR. In our experiments we refer to
the regularized models as HRED-EI  VHRED-EI  and VHCR-EI  respectively  or  more gener-
ally  EI models as opposed to baseline models. The code for all our models is available at
https://github.com/natashamjaques/neural_chat and was originally based on [4]. For
details regarding hyper-parameter tuning refer to §A.12.

Interactive evaluation methodologies

4.1 Traditional evaluation

Automatic metrics Embedding-based metrics compare generated sentences to ground truth sentences
using a vector representation of words [2]. In this work  we use three embedding metrics: embedding
average  vector extrema  and greedy matching. These three metrics are used in previous open-domain
dialog models [1  3  4]. We also use perplexity as a standard measure of the likelihood of the

generated sentences with respect to the target outputs. Another common metric for variational models
is the KL-Divergence between the posterior and the prior distribution  as a way of assessing the
information encoded into the latent variables [21] (Figure 1 illustrates KL for the VHRED model).
More information regarding embedding metrics can be found in §A.7.
Conventional static human evaluation We employ a similar method to previous work for our static
human evaluation of generated responses [3  4]  sampling contexts from each corpus and asking
humans to compare the generated responses. To reduce ambiguity  we exclude contexts shorter
than 10 tokens and contexts containing <unknown> tokens. We recruited participants from Amazon
Mechanical Turk (AMT) to compare generated sentences. Annotators could also select a third “tied”
option. For each example (context and pair of generated sentences)  we asked annotators to compare
generated sentences based on quality  ﬂuency  diversity  contingency  and empathy. Each batch of
100 pairwise comparisons were labeled by 6 - 8 annotators.

4.2

Interactive human evaluation

To address the limitations of static human evaluation  we built a platform for conducting interactive
evaluation of dialog models with humans  which we make available in open-source to the community
(see Figure 2). Annotators rated quality  ﬂuency  diversity  relatedness  and empathy of a bot after
interacting with it for at least 3 turns. Participants can also upvote or downvote each bot response.
For more information about this platform  see §A.10. Our goal is to make this work transparent
and reproducible  while adding diversity to the platforms future practitioners can choose to use (e.g.
ParlAI [34]  Plato Research Dialog System [35]  ChatEval [36]).

4.3 Novel metrics and self-play

Inspired by real-world human interactions  we introduce novel metrics to capture the morphology
of a conversation  i.e.  how the users’ responses progress over time and how the bot’s responses
interact with them. We propose a hybrid combination of these metrics  MH  that is optimized to
predict conversation quality on human data. We then apply MH to self-play  i.e.  the trajectory of
bot-generated responses  and investigate how it relates to human ratings of conversation quality.
Sentiment metrics To approximate emotional tone of an utterance  we use a state-of-the-art sentiment
detector trained on a large Twitter corpus [32]. This pre-trained model outputs an emotion embedding
– a probability distribution over 64 most-frequently used emojis. To estimate the Sentiment Coherence
between user’s query and generated samples  we calculate the cosine similarity between their emotion
embeddings. We deﬁne a set of weights over the 64 emojis and calculate the weighted sum over an
emotion embedding vector to derive a Sentiment score which is higher for positive sentiment and
lower for negative sentiment (See §A.11). We deﬁne Sentiment Transition as the change between
user’s Sentiment before and after a bot response. Additionally  Sentiment Min-Max is deﬁned by the
slope of change between min and max Sentiment in user utterances over the course of a conversation.
Since humor can be used to create solidarity [10]  we count the number of “ha"s in the user response
as a proxy for Laughter. The combination of these metrics provides a snapshot of the trajectory of
sentiment in a conversation and quantiﬁes if the bot is able to elicit positive emotions in the user.

5

 a)b)Semantic metrics Language style matching is a strong predictor of relationship stability [11] and
social cohesiveness [12]; thus  we introduce metrics to capture lexical similarity. We use Infersent 
a state-of-the-art sentence-embedding model to encode the user and bot responses into a 4096-
dimensional embedding space [33]. Infersent was trained to distinguish if two sentences are support-
ing  contradicting  or have a neutral relationship. We estimate Semantic Similarity by calculating the
cosine similarity between the infersent embedding of the user’s query and the generated bot sample.
Additionally  we use the classic Word2Vec embeddings trained on Google News Corpus along with
average  extrema  and greedy aggregation methods similar to Section 4.1 to derive Average Word
Coherence  Extrema Word Coherence  and Greedy Word Coherence between user and bot responses.
Engagement metrics Asking questions is an important active listening skill which is linked to
conversation management  attentiveness  and responsiveness [13  37]. Therefore  we deﬁne Question
Score to quantify if the bot is using question words and/or a question mark. We also introduce # Words
as a proxy for user engagement that counts the number of words in their response.
Hybrid metric (MH) We combine the aforementioned metrics (Mi) using linear regression  and
optimize their coefﬁcients (λi) to best predict human judgment of interactive conversation quality:

MH =(cid:80) λi ∗ Mi + M0. We use a leave-bot-out scenario where we isolate all the human conversa-

tions with one of the dialog models  χj  as the hold-out test set. We train the λi j on the remaining
quality ratings. We found that the learned λis were stable across the training folds  only exhibiting
small variations. Other researchers are encouraged to use our learned coefﬁcients directly or adjust
them according to their own interactive human evaluation dataset. See §A.2 for more details about
the learned λis.
Self-play as an approximation for interactive evaluation Since interactive human evaluation is
costly  we propose a self-play scenario where the dialog system talks to itself  i.e. the bot generated
responses are fed back into it as the next turn input. For each model χj  we generate 100 random
conversations  ﬁxed at 10 turns. The self-play trajectories created using model χj are treated as the
hold-out set. Therefore  the trained λi j values based on all conversations except for the ones with χj
are used to calculate MH on each generated bot-bot conversation trajectory for χj. The estimated
MH values are averaged across conversation samples for χj. This value is used for comparison
against the ground-truth interactive quality ratings aggregated on the bot-level.

5 Experiments

5.1 Datasets

A common source of data for open-domain dialog systems is movie scripts  among which the COR-
NELL dataset [38] is the largest and most commonly used. Therefore  we use it to benchmark against
previous state-of-the-art results [4]. Its median conversation length is 3 utterances and the conversa-
tions are strictly between pairs of speakers. Recognizing that movie lines have limited conversation
diversity  we also built a new corpus  REDDIT. Between the many different subreddits available 
the conversations vastly differ on topic  language style  and participation patterns. We select the
Casual Conversations forum (r/CasualConversations)  a community of 607K conversationalists
discussing a variety of topics. We collect a dataset of 109K conversations of at least 3 turns with the
median conversation containing 7 utterances from conversational exchanges on the platform in 20182.
More more details about this dataset refer to §A.6.

Table 2 summarizes human ratings of baseline and EI models obtained via interactive evaluation. In
total  565 ratings were captured. Each dialog model has been evaluated by a number of annotators 
ranging from 36 to 56. For additional information about human annotators refer to §A.9. We

REDDIT). We found a signiﬁcant main effect of EI regularization and dataset  but no signiﬁcant
difference between the three types of hierarchical models. We found that adding emotion and
infersent (EI) regularization to baseline models improved the interactive chat experience signiﬁcantly 
F (554  1) = 9.016  p = .003. Further  the models trained on the REDDIT dataset performed
signiﬁcantly better  F (554  1) = 30.796  p < .001. This ﬁnding validates the hypothesis that
distilling information about topic and tone into the top level of the hierarchy is useful for good
conversation  and suggests that the REDDIT dataset could provide more realistic training for open-
domain dialog and be valuable to the community. Additional ablation results are provided in §A.1.

5.3 Traditional metrics

Automatic metrics Several prior works have focused on ensuring that the variational KL term
remains high in order to improve model quality (e.g. [4  21]). However  we observe there is no
consistency between human quality rating and KL (Table 3). See §A.8 for details about other human
metrics  e.g. ﬂuency  diversity  contingency  and empathy. Thus  it is not evident that KL captures
human judgements of dialog quality. Even perplexity (a transformation of the cross-entropy loss used
to train our models) falls short of capturing human quality judgments  underscoring the difﬁculty
in effectively training good language models. We ﬁnd embedding metrics show more promise in
preserving the order of human quality ratings  but have only weak correlation with human ratings.
We present evidence for our novel hybrid metric being a much stronger alternative.
Human static evaluation As shown in Table 4  while static human evaluation suggests EI regular-

median Cohen’s κ of previous work [1] and explains the larger conﬁdence intervals. Even after
removing ambiguous examples (i.e. where equal number of annotators select each response as being
better)  large annotation variation persists. This may be due to subjectivity and ambiguity arising
from different interpretations of <unknown> tokens or the short length of contexts in the CORNELL
corpus (e.g. median length of conversation of 3 utterances). These ﬁndings further highlight the
importance of an interactive evaluation as opposed to limited static responses.

5.4 Novel metrics applied to human data and self-play

We examine how the novel psychologically-inspired metrics relate to the trajectories of the 100 best
and 100 worst quality conversations. This is only feasible with interactive evaluation. As shown
in Figure 3  we observe that appropriate sentiment  coherent semantics  and engaging users are
indispensable to attaining high quality ratings in interactive interaction. Comparing EI and baseline
conditions  we see a replication of these trends (Figure 4). For example  EI elicits longer responses
from users (greater engagement)  with more laughter and higher semantic coherence.
Figure 5 summarizes the relationships between interactive human ratings and the automated metrics4.
We observe that our sentiment metric applied to human data on its own has higher correlation
with interactive human ratings than the commonly used metrics such as perplexity and embedding
distance metrics. Most importantly  our novel hybrid metric  MH  applied to self-play 5 aggregated
on the model-level is strongly correlated with all human ratings (r > .7)  while previous metrics
achieved r < .5. This is a signiﬁcant ﬁnding  suggesting that even without running interactive human
evaluation  we can automatically approximate it through self-play. This metric is agnostic to the
training set and model type and can be calculated on the trajectory of self-play utterances for any
chatbot  regardless of its architecture. One interpretation is that the self-play framework keeps the
conversation within the training set distribution  and the model is less likely to produce <unknown>
tokens. Therefore  MH and its sub-components have meaningful values and can be useful for quality
approximation.
On a realistic conversation trajectory  MH is a hybrid of conﬂicting objectives and thus is less
susceptible to exploitation [40]. However  the purpose of the self-play metric ( ˆMH) in its current
form is a post-hoc evaluation of a dialog model. There are precautions if one intends to directly
optimize for ˆMH or its sub-components  for example in a reinforcement learning scenario. The
current formulation of self-play uses trajectories entirely generated by the same model. If one intends
to optimize ˆMH  we suggest calculating it on conversation trajectories between the bot and an external
baseline model or a ﬁxed copy [41]  or adopting adversarial learning by maintaining a discriminator
to distinguish between real/fake conversations [42]. This implicitly enforces generating realistic
language. Additionally  we have shown how to successfully learn using sub-components of ˆMH as
reward functions [43].

6 Conclusions

A major obstacle in open-domain dialog generation is the predominant optimization of an objective
function that does not closely match human judgment of conversation quality in a naturalistic chat.
In this paper  we have argued that it is necessary to go beyond static evaluation by investigating the

and exhibit high diversity for variational models. Details can be found in §A.13.

strengths of interactive evaluation and highlighting blind-spots of traditional static evaluation methods.
To alleviate this problem  we have combined interactive human data with psychologically-motivated
measures and introduced a novel hybrid metric. Using this metric in a self-play framework provides
results that are strongly correlated with human judgment of chatbot empathy (r > .8) and quality
(r > .7). Additionally  we have demonstrated a signiﬁcant improvement to several hierarchical
seq2seq generative models using regularization of the utterance level of the hierarchy with knowledge
distillation. Finally  we have open-sourced the platform together with a new REDDIT dataset.
