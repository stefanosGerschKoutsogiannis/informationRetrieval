Abstract

Inﬂuence maximization in social networks has typically been studied in the context
of contagion models and irreversible processes. In this paper  we consider an
alternate model that treats individual opinions as spins in an Ising system at dynamic
equilibrium. We formalize the Ising inﬂuence maximization problem  which has a
natural physical interpretation as maximizing the magnetization given a budget of
external magnetic ﬁeld. Under the mean-ﬁeld (MF) approximation  we present a
gradient ascent algorithm that uses the susceptibility to efﬁciently calculate local
maxima of the magnetization  and we develop a number of sufﬁcient conditions
for when the MF magnetization is concave and our algorithm converges to a
global optimum. We apply our algorithm on random and real-world networks 
demonstrating  remarkably  that the MF optimal external ﬁelds (i.e.  the external
ﬁelds which maximize the MF magnetization) shift from focusing on high-degree
individuals at high temperatures to focusing on low-degree individuals at low
temperatures. We also establish a number of novel results about the structure of
steady-states in the ferromagnetic MF Ising model on general graph topologies 
which are of independent interest.

Introduction

With the proliferation of online social networks  the problem of optimally inﬂuencing the opinions
of individuals in a population has garnered tremendous attention [1–3]. The prevailing paradigm
treats marketing as a viral process  whereby the advertiser is given a budget of seed infections and
chooses the subset of individuals to infect such that the spread of the ensuing contagion is maximized.
The development of algorithmic methods for inﬂuence maximization under the viral paradigm has
been the subject of vigorous study  resulting in a number of efﬁcient techniques for identifying
meaningful marketing strategies in real-world settings [4–6]. While the viral paradigm accurately
describes out-of-equilibrium phenomena  such as the introduction of new ideas or products to a
system  these models fail to capture reverberant opinion dynamics wherein repeated interactions
between individuals in the network give rise to complex macroscopic opinion patterns  as  for example 
is the case in the formation of political opinions [7–10]. In this context  rather than maximizing
the spread of a viral advertisement  the marketer is interested in optimally shifting the equilibrium
opinions of individuals in the network.
To describe complex macroscopic opinion patterns resulting from repeated microscopic interactions 
we naturally employ the language of statistical mechanics  treating individual opinions as spins in an
Ising system at dynamic equilibrium and modeling marketing as the addition of an external magnetic
ﬁeld. The resulting problem  which we call Ising inﬂuence maximization (IIM)  has a natural physical
interpretation as maximizing the magnetization of an Ising system given a budget of external ﬁeld.
While a number of models have been proposed for describing reverberant opinion dynamics [11]  our

30th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016)  Barcelona  Spain.

use of the Ising model follows a vibrant interdisciplinary literature [12  13]  and is closely related
to models in game theory [14  15] and sociophysics [16  17]. Furthermore  complex Ising models
have found widespread use in machine learning  and our model is formally equivalent to a pair-wise
Markov random ﬁeld or a Boltzmann machine [18–20].
Our main contributions are as follows:

1. We formalize the inﬂuence maximization problem in the context of the Ising model  which
we call the Ising inﬂuence maximization (IIM) problem. We also propose the mean-ﬁeld
Ising inﬂuence maximization (MF-IIM) problem as an approximation to IIM (Section 2).

2. We ﬁnd sufﬁcient conditions under which the MF-IIM objective is smooth and concave 
and we present a gradient ascent algorithm that guarantees an -approximation to MF-IIM
(Section 4).

3. We present numerical simulations that probe the structure and performance of MF optimal
marketing strategies. We ﬁnd that at high temperatures  it is optimal to focus inﬂuence on
high-degree individuals  while at low temperatures  it is optimal to spread inﬂuence among
low-degree individuals (Sections 5 and 6).

4. Throughout the paper we present a number of novel results concerning the structure of
steady-states in the ferromagnetic MF Ising model on general (weighted  directed) strongly-
connected graphs  which are of independent interest. We name two highlights:
• The well-known pitchfork bifurcation structure for the ferromagnetic MF Ising model
on a lattice extends exactly to general strongly-connected graphs  and the critical
temperature is equal to the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix (Theorem 3).
• There can exist at most one stable steady-state with non-negative (non-positive) com-

ponents  and it is smooth and concave (convex) in the external ﬁeld (Theorem 4).

2 The Ising inﬂuence maximization problem
We consider a weighted  directed social network consisting of a set of individuals N = {1  . . .   n} 
each of which is assigned an opinion σi ∈ {±1} that captures its current state. By analogy with the
Ising model  we refer to σ = (σi) as a spin conﬁguration of the system. Individuals in the network
interact via a non-negative weighted coupling matrix J ∈ Rn×n≥0   where Jij ≥ 0 represents the
amount of inﬂuence that individual j holds over the opinion of individual i  and the non-negativity of
J represents the assumption that opinions of neighboring individuals tend to align  known in physics
as a ferromagnetic interaction. Each individual also interacts with forces external to the network via
an external ﬁeld h ∈ Rn. For example  if the spins represent the political opinions of individuals in a
social network  then Jij represents the inﬂuence that j holds over i’s opinion and hi represents the
political bias of node i due to external forces such as campaign advertisements and news articles.
The opinions of individuals in the network evolve according to asynchronous Glauber dynamics. At
each time t  an individual i is selected uniformly at random and her opinion is updated in response to
the external ﬁeld h and the opinions of others in the network σ(t) by sampling from

P (σi(t + 1) = 1|σ(t)) =

where β is the inverse temperature  which we refer to as the interaction strength  and unless otherwise
speciﬁed  sums are assumed over N. Together  the quadruple (N  J  h  β) deﬁnes our system. We
i (cid:104)σi(cid:105)  as the magnetization  where (cid:104)·(cid:105) denotes an average
over the dynamics in Eq. (1)  and we often consider the magnetization as a function of the external
ﬁeld  denoted M (h). Another important concept is the susceptibility matrix  χij = ∂(cid:104)σi(cid:105)
  which
quantiﬁes the response of individual i to a change in the external ﬁeld on node j.
We study the problem of maximizing the magnetization of an Ising system with respect to the external
ﬁeld. We assume that an external ﬁeld h can be added to the system  subject to the constraints
i hi ≤ H  where H > 0 is the external ﬁeld budget  and we denote the set of feasible
i hi = H}. In general  we also assume that the system

h ≥ 0 and(cid:80)

2.1 The mean-ﬁeld approximation

In general  calculating expectations over the dynamics in Eq. (1) requires Monte-Carlo simulations
or other numerical approximation techniques. To make analytic progress  we employ the variational
mean-ﬁeld approximation  which has roots in statistical physics and has long been used to tackle
inference problems in Boltzmann machines and Markov random ﬁelds [21–24]. The mean-ﬁeld
approximation replaces the intractable task of calculating exact averages over Eq. (1) with the
problem of solving the following set of self-consistency equations:

mi = tanh

for all i ∈ N  where mi approximates (cid:104)σi(cid:105). We refer to the right-hand side of Eq. (3) as the
mean-ﬁeld map  f (m) = tanh [β(Jm + h)]  where tanh(·) is applied component-wise. In this
way  a ﬁxed point of the mean-ﬁeld map is a solution to Eq. (3)  which we call a steady-state.
In general  there may be many solutions to Eq. (3)  and we denote by Mh the set of steady-states for
a system (N  J  h  β). We say that a steady-state m is stable if ρ(f(cid:48)(m)) < 1  where ρ(·) denotes
the spectral radius and

f(cid:48)(m)ij =

3 The structure of steady-states in the MF Ising model

Before proceeding further  we must prove an important result concerning the existence and structure
of solutions to Eq. (3)  for if there exists a system that does not admit a steady-state  then our objective

3

is ill-deﬁned. Furthermore  if there exists a unique steady-state m  then M M F =(cid:80)

i mi  and there

is no ambiguity in our choice of objective.
Theorem 3 establishes that every system admits a steady-state and that the well-known pitchfork
bifurcation structure for steady-states of the ferromagnetic MF Ising model on a lattice extends exactly
to general (weighted  directed) strongly-connected graphs. In particular  for any strongly-connected
graph described by J  there is a critical interaction strength βc below which there exists a unique
and stable steady-state. For h = 0  as β crosses βc from below  two new stable steady-states appear 
one with all-positive components and one with all-negative components. Interestingly  the critical
interaction strength is equal to the inverse of the spectral radius of J  denoted βc = 1/ρ(J).
Theorem 3. Any system (N  J  h  β) exhibits a steady-state. Furthermore  if its network is strongly-
connected  then  for β < βc  there exists a unique and stable steady-state. For h = 0  as β crosses
βc from below  the unique steady-state gives rise to two stable steady-states  one with all-positive
components and one with all-negative components.
Proof sketch. The existence of a steady-state follows directly by applying Brouwer’s ﬁxed-point
theorem to f. For β < βc  it can be shown that f is a contraction mapping  and hence admits a unique
and stable steady-state by Banach’s ﬁxed point theorem. For h = 0 and β < βc  m = 0 is the unique
steady-state and f(cid:48)(m) = βJ. Because J is strongly-connected  the Perron-Frobenius theorem
guarantees a simple eigenvalue equal to ρ(J) and a corresponding all-positive eigenvector. Thus 
when β crosses 1/ρ(J) from below  the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue of f(cid:48)(m) crosses 1 from below 
giving rise to a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation with two new stable steady-states corresponding to
the Perron-Frobenius eigenvector.
Remark. Some of our results assume J is strongly-connected in order to use the Perron-Frobenius
theorem. We note that this assumption is not restrictive  since any graph can be efﬁciently decomposed
into strongly-connected components on which our results apply independently.
Theorem 3 shows that the objective M M F (b + h) is well-deﬁned. Furthermore  for β < βc  Theorem
3 guarantees a unique and stable steady-state m for all b + h. In this case  MF-IIM reduces to
i mi  and because m is stable  M M F (b + h) is smooth for all h by the
implicit function theorem. Thus  for β < βc  we can use standard gradient ascent techniques to
efﬁciently calculate locally-optimal solutions to MF-IIM. In general  M M F is not necessarily smooth
in h since the topological structure of steady-states may change as h varies. However  in the next
section we show that if there exists a stable and entry-wise non-negative steady-state  and if J is
strongly-connected  then M M F (b + h) is both smooth and concave in h  regardless of the interaction
strength.

4 Sufﬁcient conditions for when MF-IIM is concave

We consider conditions for which MF-IIM is smooth and concave  and hence exactly solvable by
efﬁcient techniques. The case under consideration is when J is strongly-connected and there exists a
stable non-negative steady-state.
Theorem 4. Let (N  J  b  β) describe a system with a strongly-connected graph for which there
i mi(b + h) 
M M F (b + h) is smooth in h  and M M F (b + h) is concave in h for all h ∈ FH.
Proof sketch. Our argument follows in three steps. We ﬁrst show that m(b) is the unique stable
non-negative steady-state and that it attains the maximum total opinion among steady-states. This
i mi(b). Furthermore  m(b) gives rise to a unique and smooth branch
i mi(b + h) for

exists a stable non-negative steady-state m(b). Then  for any H  M M F (b + h) =(cid:80)
guarantees that M M F (b) =(cid:80)
of stable non-negative steady-states for additional h  and hence M M F (b + h) =(cid:80)

all h > 0. Finally  one can directly show that M M F (b + h) is concave in h.
Remark. By arguments similar to those in Theorem 4  it can be shown that any stable non-positive
steady-state is unique  attains the minimum total opinion among steady-states  and is smooth and
convex for decreasing h.
The above result paints a signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed picture of the MF-IIM problem when J is strongly-
connected and there exists a stable non-negative steady-state m(b). Given a budget H  for any
feasible marketing strategy h ∈ FH  m(b + h) is the unique stable non-negative steady-state 
attains the maximum total opinion among steady-states  and is smooth in h. Thus  the objective

4.1 Sufﬁcient conditions for the existence of a stable non-negative steady-state

In the previous section we found that MF-IIM is efﬁciently solvable if there exists a stable non-
negative steady-state. While this assumption may seem restrictive  we show  to the contrary  that the
appearance of a stable non-negative steady-state is a fairly general phenomenon. We ﬁrst show  for J
strongly-connected  that the existence of a stable non-negative steady-state is robust to increases in h
and that the existence of a stable positive steady-state is robust to increases in β.
Theorem 5. Let (N  J  h  β) describe a system with a strongly-connected graph for which there
exists a stable non-negative steady-state m. If m ≥ 0  then as h increases  m gives rise to a unique
and smooth branch of stable non-negative steady-states. If m > 0  then as β increases  m gives rise
to a unique and smooth branch of stable positive steady-states.
Proof sketch. By the implicit function theorem  any stable steady-state can be locally deﬁned as a
function of both h and β. Using the susceptibility  one can directly show that any stable non-negative
steady-state remains stable and non-negative as h increases and that any stable positive steady-state
remains stable and positive as β increases.
The intuition behind Theorem 5 is that increasing the external ﬁeld will never destroy a steady-state in
which all of the opinions are already non-positive. Furthermore  as the interaction strength increases 
each individual reacts more strongly to the positive inﬂuence of her neighbors  creating a positive
feedback loop that results in an even more positive magnetization. We conclude by showing for J
strongly-connected that if h ≥ 0  then there exists a stable non-negative steady-state.
Theorem 6. Let (N  J  h  β) describe any system with a strongly-connected network. If h ≥ 0  then
there exists a stable non-negative steady-state.
Proof sketch. For h > 0 and β < βc  it can be shown that the unique steady-state is positive  and
hence Theorem 5 guarantees the result for all β(cid:48) > β. For h = 0  Theorem 3 provides the result.
All together  the results of this section provide a number of sufﬁcient conditions under which MF-IIM
is exactly and efﬁciently solvable by Algorithm 1.

5 A shift in the structure of solutions to MF-IIM

The structure of solutions to MF-IIM is of fundamental theoretical and practical interest. We
demonstrate  remarkably  that solutions to MF-IIM shift from focusing on nodes of high degree at
low interaction strengths to focusing on nodes of low degree at high interaction strengths.
Consider an Ising system described by (N  J  h  β) in the limit β (cid:28) βc. To ﬁrst-order in β  the
self-consistency equations (3) take the form:

m = β (Jm + h) ⇒ m = β(I − βJ)−1h.

Since β < βc  we have ρ(βJ) < 1  allowing us to expand (I − βJ)−1 in a geometric series:

m = βh + β2Jh + O(β3) ⇒ M M F (h) = β

magnetization is maximized by focusing the external ﬁeld on the nodes of highest out-degree in the
network  independent of b and H.
To study the structure of solutions to MF-IIM at high interaction strengths  we make the simplifying
assumptions that J is strongly-connected and b ≥ 0 so that Theorem 6 guarantees a stable non-
negative steady state m. For large β and an additional external ﬁeld h ∈ FH  m takes the form

Eq. (12) reveals that the high-β solutions to MF-IIM focus on the nodes for which din
i + bi + hi is
smallest. Thus  if b is uniform  the MF magnetization is maximized by focusing the external ﬁeld on
the nodes of smallest in-degree in the network.
We emphasize the strength and novelty of the above results. In the context of reverberant opinion
dynamics  the optimal control strategy has a highly non-trivial dependence on the strength of
interactions in the system  a feature not captured by viral models. Thus  when controlling a social
system  accurately determining the strength of interactions is of critical importance.

6 Numerical simulations

We present numerical experiments to probe the structure and performance of MF optimal external
ﬁelds. We verify that the solutions to MF-IIM undergo a shift from focusing on high-degree nodes at
low interaction strengths to focusing on low-degree nodes at high interaction strengths. We also ﬁnd
that for sufﬁciently high and low interaction strengths  the MF optimal external ﬁeld achieves the
maximum exact magnetization  while admitting performance losses near βc. However  even at βc 
we demonstrate that solutions to MF-IIM signiﬁcantly outperform common node-selection heuristics
based on node degree and centrality.
We ﬁrst consider an undirected hub-and-spoke network  shown in Figure 1  where Jij ∈ {0  1} and
we set b = 0 for simplicity. Since b ≥ 0  Algorithm 1 is guaranteed to achieve a globally optimal MF
magnetization. Furthermore  because the network is small  we can calculate exact solutions to IIM
by brute force search. The left plot in Figure 1 compares the average degree of the MF and exact
optimal external ﬁelds over a range of temperatures for an external ﬁeld budget H = 1  verifying

that the solution to MF-IIM shifts from focusing on high-degree nodes at low interaction strengths
to low-degree nodes at high interaction strengths. Furthermore  we ﬁnd that the shift in the MF
optimal external ﬁeld occurs near the critical interaction strength βc = .5. The performance of the
MF optimal strategy (measured as the ratio of the magnetization achieved by the MF solution to that
achieved by the exact solution) is shown in the right plot in Figure 1. For low and high interaction
strengths  the MF optimal external ﬁeld achieves the maximum magnetization  while near βc  it incurs
signiﬁcant performance losses  a phenomenon well-studied in the literature [21].
We now consider a stochastic block network consisting of 100 nodes split into two blocks of 50
nodes each  shown in Figure 2. An undirected edge of weight 1 is placed between each pair of
nodes in Block 1 with probability .2  between each pair in Block 2 with probability .05  and between
nodes in different blocks with probability .05  resulting in a highly-connected community (Block
1) surrounded by a sparsely-connected community (Block 2). For b = 0 and H = 20  the center
plot in Figure 2 demonstrates that the solution to MF-IIM shifts from focusing on Block 1 at low β
to focusing on Block 2 at high β and that the shift occurs near βc. The stochastic block network is
sufﬁciently large that exact calculation of the optimal external ﬁelds is infeasible. Thus  we resort
to comparing the MF solutions with three node-selection heuristics: one that distributes the budget
in amounts proportional to nodes’ degrees  one that distributes the budget proportional to nodes’
centralities (the inverse of a node’s average shortest path length to all other nodes)  and one that
distributes the budget randomly. The magnetizations are approximated via Monte Carlo simulations
of the Glauber dynamics  and we consider the system at β = βc to represent the worst-case scenario
for the MF optimal external ﬁelds. The right plot in Figure 2 shows that  even at βc  the solutions to
MF-IIM outperform common node-selection heuristics.
We consider a real-world collaboration network (Figure 3) composed of 904 individuals  where each
edge is unweighted and represents the co-authorship of a paper on the arXiv [26]. We note that
co-authorship networks are known to capture many of the key structural features of social networks

[27]. For b = 0 and H = 40  the center plot in Figure 3 illustrates the sharp shift in the solution
to MF-IIM at βc = 0.05 from high- to low-degree nodes. Furthermore  the right plot in Figure
3 compares the performance of the MF optimal external ﬁeld with the node-selection heuristics
described above  where we again consider the system at βc as a worst-case scenario  demonstrating
that Algorithm 1 is scalable and performs well on real-world networks.

7 Conclusions

We study inﬂuence maximization  one of the fundamental problems in network science  in the
context of the Ising model  wherein repeated interactions between individuals give rise to complex
macroscopic patterns. The resulting problem  which we call Ising inﬂuence maximization  has a
natural physical interpretation as maximizing the magnetization of an Ising system given a budget
of external magnetic ﬁeld. Under the mean-ﬁeld approximation  we develop a number of sufﬁcient
conditions for when the problem is concave  and we provide a gradient ascent algorithm that uses the
susceptibility to efﬁciently calculate locally-optimal external ﬁelds. Furthermore  we demonstrate
that the MF optimal external ﬁelds shift from focusing on high-degree individuals at low interaction
strengths to focusing on low-degree individuals at high interaction strengths  a phenomenon not
observed in viral models. We apply our algorithm on random and real-world networks  numerically
demonstrating shifts in the solution structure and showing that our algorithm out-performs common
node-selection heuristics.
It would be interesting to study the exact Ising model on an undirected network  in which case the
spin statistics are governed by the Boltzmann distribution. Using this elegant steady-state description 
one might be able to derive analytic results for the exact IIM problem. Our work establishes a fruitful
connection between inﬂuence maximization and statistical physics  paving the way for exciting
cross-disciplinary research. For example  one could apply advanced mean-ﬁeld techniques  such
as those in [21]  to generate efﬁcient algorithms of increasing accuracy. Furthermore  because our
model is equivalent to a Boltzmann machine  one could propose a framework for data-based inﬂuence
maximization based on well-known Boltzmann machine learning techniques.
