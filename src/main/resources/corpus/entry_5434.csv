Abstract

In simple perceptual decisions the brain has to identify a stimulus based on noisy
sensory samples from the stimulus. Basic statistical considerations state that the
reliability of the stimulus information  i.e.  the amount of noise in the samples 
should be taken into account when the decision is made. However  for perceptual
decision making experiments it has been questioned whether the brain indeed uses
the reliability for making decisions when confronted with unpredictable changes
in stimulus reliability. We here show that even the basic drift diffusion model 
which has frequently been used to explain experimental ﬁndings in perceptual
decision making  implicitly relies on estimates of stimulus reliability. We then
show that only those variants of the drift diffusion model which allow stimulus-
speciﬁc reliabilities are consistent with neurophysiological ﬁndings. Our analysis
suggests that the brain estimates the reliability of the stimulus on a short time scale
of at most a few hundred milliseconds.

Introduction

In perceptual decision making participants have to identify a noisy stimulus. In typical experiments 
only two possibilities are considered [1]. The amount of noise on the stimulus is usually varied to
manipulate task difﬁculty. With higher noise  participants’ decisions are slower and less accurate.
Early psychology research established that biased random walk models explain the response distri-
butions (choice and reaction time) of perceptual decision making experiments [2]. These models
describe decision making as an accumulation of noisy evidence until a bound is reached and cor-
respond  in discrete time  to sequential analysis [3] as developed in statistics [4]. More recently 
electrophysiological experiments provided additional support for such bounded accumulation mod-
els  see [1] for a review.
There appears to be a general consensus that the brain implements the mechanisms required for
bounded accumulation  although different models were proposed for how exactly this accumulation
is employed by the brain [5  6  1  7  8]. An important assumption of all these models is that the
brain provides the input to the accumulation  the so-called evidence  but the most established models
actually do not deﬁne how this evidence is computed by the brain [3  5  9  1]. In this contribution  we
will show that addressing this question offers a new perspective on how exactly perceptual decision
making may be performed by the brain.
Probabilistic models provide a precise deﬁnition of evidence: Evidence is the likelihood of a de-
cision alternative under a noisy measurement where the likelihood is deﬁned through a generative
model of the measurements under the hypothesis that the considered decision alternative is true. In
particular  this generative model implements assumptions about the expected distribution of mea-
surements. Therefore  the likelihood of a measurement is large when measurements are assumed 

1

by the decision maker  to be reliable and small otherwise. For modelling perceptual decision making
experiments  the evidence input  which is assumed to be pre-computed by the brain  should simi-
larly depend on the reliability of measurements as estimated by the brain. However  this has been
disputed before  e.g. [10]. The argument is that typical experimental setups make the reliability of
each trial unpredictable for the participant. Therefore  it was argued  the brain can have no correct
estimate of the reliability. This issue has been addressed in a neurally inspired  probabilistic model
based on probabilistic population codes (PPCs) [7]. The authors have shown that PPCs can imple-
ment perceptual decision making without having to explicitly represent reliability in the decision
process. This remarkable result has been obtained by making the comprehensible assumption that
reliability has a multiplicative effect on the tuning curves of the neurons in the PPCs1. Current stim-
ulus reliability  therefore  was implicitly represented in the tuning curves of model neurons and still
affected decisions.
In this paper we will investigate on a conceptual level whether the brain estimates measurement
reliability even within trials while we will not consider the details of its neural representation. We
will show that even a simple  widely used bounded accumulation model  the drift diffusion model  is
based on some estimate of measurement reliability. Using this result  we will analyse the results of a
perceptual decision making experiment [11] and will show that the recorded behaviour together with
neurophysiological ﬁndings strongly favours the hypothesis that the brain weights evidence using
a current estimate of measurement reliability  even when reliability changes unpredictably across
trials.
This paper is organised as follows: We ﬁrst introduce the notions of measurement  evidence and
likelihood in the context of the experimentally well-established random dot motion (RDM) stimulus.
We deﬁne these quantities formally by resorting to a simple probabilistic model which has been
shown to be equivalent to the drift diffusion model [12  13]. This  in turn  allows us to formulate
three competing variants of the drift diffusion model that either do not use trial-dependent reliability
(variant CONST)  or do use trial-dependent reliability of measurements during decision making
(variants DDM and DEPC  see below for deﬁnitions). Finally  using data of [11]  we show that
only variants DDM and DEPC  which use trial-dependent reliability  are consistent with previous
ﬁndings about perceptual decision making in the brain.

2 Measurement  evidence and likelihood in the random dot motion stimulus

The widely used random dot motion (RDM) stimulus consists of a set of randomly located dots
shown within an invisible circle on a screen [14]. From one video frame to the next some of the
dots move into one direction which is ﬁxed within a trial of an experiment  i.e.  a subset of the dots
moves coherently in one direction. All other dots are randomly replaced within the circle. Although
there are many variants of how exactly to present the dots [15]  the main idea is that the coherently
moving dots indicate a motion direction which participants have to decide upon. By varying the
proportion of dots which move coherently  also called the ’coherence’ of the stimulus  the difﬁculty
of the task can be varied effectively.
We will now consider what kind of evidence the brain can in principle extract from the RDM stim-
ulus in a short time window  for example  from one video frame to the next  within a trial. For
simplicity we call this time window ’time point’ from here on  the idea being that evidence is ac-
cumulated over different time points  as postulated by bounded accumulation models in perceptual
decision making [3  1].
At a single time point  the brain can measure motion directions from the dots in the RDM display. By
construction  a proportion of measurable motion directions will be into one speciﬁc direction  but 
through the random relocation of other dots  the RDM display will also contain motion in random
directions. Therefore  the brain observes a distribution of motion directions at each time point. This
distribution can be considered a ’measurement’ of the RDM stimulus made by the brain. Due to the
randomness of each time frame  this distribution varies across time points and the variation in the
distribution reduces for increasing coherences. We have illustrated this using rose histograms in Fig.
1 for three different coherence levels.

1Note that the precise effect on tuning curves may depend on the particular distribution of measurements

and its encoding by the neural population.

Figure 1: Illustration of possible motion direction distributions that the brain can measure from
an RDM stimulus. Rows are different time points  columns are different coherences. The true 
underlying motion direction was ’left’  i.e.  180◦. For low coherence (e.g.  3.2%) the measured
distribution is very variable across time points and may indicate the presence of many different
motion directions at any given time point. As coherence increases (from 9% to 25.6%)  the true 
underlying motion direction will increasingly dominate measured motion directions simultaneously
leading to decreased variation of the measured distribution across time points.

To compute the evidence for the decision whether the RDM stimulus contains predominantly motion
to one of the two considered directions  e.g.  left and right  the brain must check how strongly these
directions are represented in the measured distribution  e.g.  by estimating the proportion of motion
towards left and right. We call these proportions evidence for left  eleft  and evidence for right 
eright. As the measured distribution over motion directions may vary strongly across time points  the
computed evidences for each single time point may be unreliable. Probabilistic approaches weight
evidence by its reliability such that unreliable evidence is not over-interpreted. The question is: Does
the brain perform this reliability-based computation as well? More formally  for a given coherence 
c  does the brain weight evidence by an estimate of reliability that depends on c: l = e · r(c)2 and
which we call ’likelihood’  or does it ignore changing reliabilities and use a weighting unrelated to
coherence: e(cid:48) = e · ¯r?

3 Bounded accumulation models

Bounded accumulation models postulate that decisions are made based on a decision variable. In
particular  this decision variable is driven towards the correct alternative and is perturbed by noise.
A decision is made  when the decision variable reaches a speciﬁc value. In the drift diffusion model 
these three components are represented by drift  diffusion and bound [3]. We will now relate the
typical drift diffusion formalism to our notions of measurement  evidence and likelihood by linking
the drift diffusion model to probabilistic formulations.
In the drift diffusion model  the decision variable evolves according to a simple Wiener process with
drift. In discrete time the change in the decision variable y can be written as

√

Gaussian log-likelihood  hence  the linear weighting of evidence by reliability.

This
equation bears an interesting link to how the brain may compute the evidence. For example  it has
been stated in the context of an experiment with RDM stimuli with two decision alternatives that
the change in y  often called ’momentary evidence’  ”is thought to be a difference in ﬁring rates of
direction selective neurons with opposite direction preferences.” [11  Supp. Fig. 6] Formally:

δy = ρleft t − ρright t

(2)
where ρleft t is the ﬁring rate of the population selective to motion towards left at time point t.
Because the ﬁring rates ρ depend on the considered decision alternative  they represent a form of
evidence extracted from the stimulus measurement instead of the stimulus measurement itself (see
our deﬁnitions in the previous section). It is unclear  however  whether the ﬁring rates ρ just represent
the evidence (ρ = e(cid:48)) or whether they represent the likelihood  ρ = l  i.e.  the evidence weighted by
coherence-dependent reliability.
To clarify the relation between ﬁring rates ρ  evidence e and likelihood l we consider probabilistic
models of perceptual decision making. Several variants have been suggested and related to other
forms of decision making [6  16  9  7  12  17  18]. For its simplicity  which is sufﬁcient for our
argument  we here consider the model presented in [13] for which a direct transformation from
probabilistic model to the drift diffusion model has already been shown. This model deﬁnes two
Gaussian generative models of measurements which are derived from the stimulus:

p(xt|left) = N (−1  δtˆσ2)

(3)
where ˆσ represents the variability of measurements expected by the brain. Similarly  it is assumed
that the measurements xt are sampled from a Gaussian with variance σ2 which captures variance
both from the stimulus and due to other noise sources in the brain:

p(xt|right) = N (1  δtˆσ2)

(4)
where the mean is −1 for a ’left’ stimulus and 1 for a ’right’ stimulus. Evidence for a decision is
computed in this model by calculating the likelihood of a measurement xt under the hypothesised
generative models. To be precise we consider the log-likelihood which is

xt ∼ N (±1  δtσ2)

√
lleft = − log(

2πδtˆσ) − 1

(xt − 1)2

δtˆσ2

√
lright = − log(

2πδtˆσ) − 1
2

(xt + 1)2

δtˆσ2

.

(5)

We note three important points: 1) The ﬁrst term on the right hand side means that for decreasing
ˆσ the likelihood l increases  when the measurement xt is close to the means  i.e.  −1 and 1. This
contribution  however  cancels when the difference between the likelihoods for left and right is
computed. 2) The likelihood is large for a measurement xt  when xt is close to the corresponding
mean. 3) The contribution of the stimulus is weighted by the assumed reliability r = ˆσ−2.
This model of the RDM stimulus is simple but captures the most important properties of the stim-
ulus. In particular  a high coherence RDM stimulus has a large proportion of motion in the correct
direction with very low variability of measurements whereas a low coherence RDM stimulus tends
to have lower proportions of motion in the correct direction  with high variability (cf. Fig. 1). The
Gaussian model captures these properties by adjusting the noise variance such that a high coherence
corresponds to low noise and low coherence to high noise: Under high noise the values xt will vary
strongly and tend to be rather distant from −1 and 1  whereas for low noise the values xt will be close
to −1 or 1 with low variability. Hence  as expected  the model produces large evidences/likelihoods
for low noise and small evidences/likelihoods for high noise.
This intuitive relation between stimulus and probabilistic model is the basis for us to proceed to
show that the reliability of the stimulus r  connected to the coherence level c  appears at a prominent
position in the drift diffusion model. Crucially  the drift diffusion model can be derived as the sum
of log-likelihood ratios across time [3  9  12  13]. In particular  a discrete time drift diffusion process
can be derived by subtracting the likelihoods of Eq. (5):

δy = lright − lleft =

(xt + 1)2 − (xt − 1)2

2δtˆσ2

=

2rxt
δt

.

(6)

Consequently  the change in y within a trial  in which the true stimulus is constant  is Gaussian:
δy ∼ N (2r/δt  4r2σ2/δt). This replicates the model described in [11  Supp. Fig. 6] where the
parameterisation of the model  however  more directly followed that of the Gaussian distribution

4

and did not explicitly take time into account: δy ∼ N (Kc  S2)  where K and S are free parameters
and c is coherence of the RDM stimulus. By analogy to the probabilistic model  we  therefore  see
that the model in [11] implicitly assumes that reliability r depends on coherence c.
More generally  the parameters of the drift diffusion model of Eq. (1) and that of the probabilistic
model can be expressed as functions of each other [13]:

v = ± 2

δt2 ˆσ2 = ±r

(7)

(8)

These equations state that both drift v and diffusion s depend on the assumed reliability r of the
measurements x. Does the brain use and necessarily compute this reliability which depends on
coherence? In the following section we answer this question by comparing how well three variants
of the drift diffusion model  that implement different assumptions about r  conform to experimental
ﬁndings.

4 Use of reliability in perceptual decision making: experimental evidence

We ﬁrst show that different assumptions about the reliability r translate to variants of the drift dif-
fusion model. We then ﬁt all variants to behavioural data (performances and mean reaction times)
of an experiment for which neurophysiological data has also been reported [11] and demonstrate
that only those variants which allow reliability to depend on coherence level lead to accumulation
mechanisms which are consistent with the neurophysiological ﬁndings.

4.1 Drift diffusion model variants

For the drift diffusion model of Eq. (1) the accuracy A and mean decision time T predicted by the
model can be determined analytically [9]:

A = 1 −

(10)

where b is the bound. These equations highlight an important caveat of the drift diffusion model:
Only two of the three parameters can be determined uniquely from behavioural data. For ﬁtting
the model one of the parameters needs to be ﬁxed. In most cases  the diffusion s is set to c = 0.1
arbitrarily [9]  or is ﬁt with a constant value across stimulus strengths [11]. We call this standard
variant of the drift diffusion model the DDM.
If s is constant across stimulus strengths  the other two parameters of the model must explain dif-
ferences in behaviour  between stimulus strengths  by taking on values that depend on stimulus
strength. Indeed  it has been found that primarily drift v explains such differences  see also be-
low. Eq. (7) states that drift depends on estimated reliability r. So  if drift varies across stimulus
strengths  this strongly suggests that r must vary across stimulus strengths  i.e.  that r must depend
on coherence: r(c). However  the drift diffusion formalism allows for two other obvious variants
of parameterisation. One in which the bound b is constant across stimulus strengths  b = ¯b  and 
conversely  one in which drift v is constant across stimulus strengths  v = ¯v ∝ ¯r (Eq. 7). We call
these variants DEPC and CONST  respectively  for their property to weight evidence by reliability
that either depends on coherence  r(c)  or not  ¯r.

4.2 Experimental data

In the following we will analyse the data presented in [11]. This data set has two major advantages
for our purposes: 1) Reported accuracies and mean reaction times (Fig. 1d f) are averages based on
15 937 trials in total. Therefore  noise in this data set is minimal (cf. small error bars in Fig. 1d f)
such that any potential effects of overﬁtting on found parameter values will be small  especially in

5

relation to the effect induced by different stimulus strengths. 2) The behavioural data is accompanied
by recordings of neurons which have been implicated in the decision making process. We can 
therefore  compare the accumulation mechanisms resulting from the ﬁt to behaviour with the actual
neurophysiological recordings. Furthermore  the structure of the experiments was such that the
stimulus in subsequent trials had random strength  i.e.  the brain could not have estimated stimulus
strength of a trial before the trial started.
In the experiment of [11]  that we consider here  two monkeys performed a two-alternative forced
choice task based on the RDM stimulus. Data for eight different coherences were reported. To avoid
ceiling effects  which prevent the unique identiﬁcation of parameter values in the drift diffusion
model  we exclude those coherences which lead to an accuracy of 0.5 (random choices) or to an
accuracy of 1 (perfect choices). The behavioural data of the remaining six coherence levels are
presented in Table 1.

The analysis of [11] revealed a nondecision time  i.e.  a component of the reaction time that is
unrelated to the decision process (cf. [3]) of ca. 200ms. Using this estimate  we determined the
mean decision time T by subtracting 200ms from the mean reaction times shown in Table 1.
The main ﬁndings for the neural recordings  which replicated previous ﬁndings [19  1]  were that i)
ﬁring rates at the end of decisions were similar and  particularly  showed no signiﬁcant relation to
coherence [11  Fig. 5] whereas ii) the buildup rate of neural ﬁring within a trial had an approximately
linear relation to coherence [11  Fig. 4].

4.3 Fits of drift diffusion model variants to behaviour

We can easily ﬁt the model variants (DDM  DEPC and CONST) to accuracy A and mean decision
time T using Eqs. (9) and (10). In accordance with previous approaches we selected values for the
respective redundant parameters. Since the redundant parameter value  or its inverse  simply scales
the ﬁtted parameter values (cf. Eqs. 9 and 10)  the exact value is irrelevant and we ﬁx  in each model
variant  the redundant parameter to 1.

Figure 2: Fitting results: values of the free parameters  that replicate the accuracy and mean RT
recorded in the experiment (Table 1)  in relation to coherence. The remaining  non-free parameter
was ﬁxed to 1 for each variant. Left: the DDM variant with free parameters drift v (green) and
bound b (purple). Middle: the DEPC variant with free parameters v and diffusion s (orange). Right:
the CONST variant with free parameters s and b.

Fig. 2 shows the inferred parameter values. In congruence with previous ﬁndings  the DDM variant
explained variation in behaviour due to an increasing coherence mostly with an increasing drift v
(green in Fig. 2). Speciﬁcally  drift and coherence appear to have a straightforward  linear relation.
The same ﬁnding holds for the DEPC variant. In contrast to the DDM variant  however  which also
exhibited a slight increase in the bound b (purple in Fig. 2) with increasing coherence  the DEPC

Fig. 2). As the drift v was ﬁxed in CONST  this variant explained coherence-dependent behaviour
with large and almost identical changes in both diffusion s and bound b such that large parameter
values occurred for small coherences and the relation between parameters and coherence appeared
to be quadratic.

for different model variants with ﬁtted parameters for 6.4% (blue) and 25.6% (yellow) coherence.
Trajectories end when they reach the bound for the ﬁrst time which corresponds to the decision

and coherences. Bottom row: Trajectories of y averaged over trials in which the ﬁrst alternative (top

Left panels show the buildup of y from the start of decision making for the 5 different coherences.
Right panels show the averaged drift diffusion trajectories when aligned to the time that a decision
was made.

We further investigated the properties of the model variants with the ﬁtted parameter values. The top
row of Fig. 3 shows example drift diffusion trajectories (y in Eq. (1)) simulated at a resolution of
1ms for two coherences. Following [11]  we interpret y as the decision variables represented by the
ﬁring rates of neurons in monkey area LIP. These plots exemplify that the DDM and DEPC variants
lead to qualitatively very similar predictions of neural responses whereas the trajectories produced
by the CONST variant stand out  because the neural responses to large coherences are predicted to
be smaller than those to small coherences.
We have summarised predicted neural responses to all coherences in the bottom row of Fig. 3 where
we show averages of y across 5000 trials either aligned to the start of decision making (left pan-
els) or aligned to the decision time (right panels). These plots illustrate that the DDM and DEPC
variants replicate the main neurophysiological ﬁndings of [11]: Neural responses at the end of the
decision were similar and independent of coherence. For the DEPC variant this was built into the
model  because the bound was ﬁxed. For the DDM variant the bound shows a small dependence
on coherence  but the neural responses aligned to decision time were still very similar across coher-
ences. The DDM and DEPC variants  further  replicate the ﬁnding that the buildup of neural ﬁring
depends approximately linear on coherence (normalised mean square error of a corresponding linear
model was 0.04 and 0.03  respectively). In contrast  the CONST variant exhibited an inverse rela-
tion between coherence and buildup of predicted neural response  i.e.  buildup was larger for small
coherences. Furthermore  neural responses at decision time strongly depended on coherence. There-
fore  the CONST variant  as the only variant which does not use coherence-dependent reliability  is
also the only variant which is clearly inconsistent with the neurophysiological ﬁndings.

We have investigated whether the brain uses online estimates of stimulus reliability when making
simple perceptual decisions. From a probabilistic perspective fundamental considerations suggest
that using accurate estimates of stimulus reliability lead to better decisions  but in the ﬁeld of percep-
tual decision making it has been questioned that the brain estimates stimulus reliability on the very
short time scale of a few hundred milliseconds. By using a probabilistic formulation of the most
widely accepted model we were able to show that only those variants of the model which assume
online reliability estimation are consistent with reported experimental ﬁndings.
Our argument is based on a strict distinction between measurements  evidence and likelihood which
may be brieﬂy summarised as follows: Measurements are raw stimulus features that do not relate to
the decision  evidence is a transformation of measurements into a decision relevant space reﬂecting
the decision alternatives and likelihood is evidence scaled by a current estimate of measurement
reliabilities. It is easy to overlook this distinction at the level of bounded accumulation models 
such as the drift diffusion model  because these models assume a pre-computed form of evidence as
input. However  this evidence has to be computed by the brain  as we have demonstrated based on
the example of the RDM stimulus and using behavioural data.
We chose one particular  simple probabilistic model  because this model has a direct equivalence
with the drift diffusion model which was used to explain the data of [11] before. Other models may
have not allowed conclusions about reliability estimates in the brain. In particular  [13] introduced
an alternative model that also leads to equivalence with the drift diffusion model  but explains dif-
ferences in behaviour by different mean measurements and their representations in the generative
model. Instead of varying reliability across coherences  this model would vary the difference of
means in the second summand of Eq. (5) directly without leading to any difference on the drift
diffusion trajectories represented by y of Eq. (1) when compared to those of the probabilistic model
chosen here. The interpretation of the alternative model of [13]  however  is far removed from basic
assumptions about the RDM stimulus: Whereas the alternative model assumes that the reliability of
the stimulus is ﬁxed across coherences  the noise in the RDM stimulus clearly depends on coherence.
We  therefore  discarded the alternative model here.
As a slight caveat  the neurophysiological ﬁndings  on which we based our conclusion  could have
been the result of a search for neurons that exhibit the properties of the conventional drift diffusion
model (the DDM variant). We cannot exclude this possibility completely  but given the wide range
and persistence of consistent evidence for the standard bounded accumulation theory of decision
making [1  20] we ﬁnd it rather unlikely that the results in [19] and [11] were purely found by
chance. Even if our conclusion about the rapid estimation of reliability by the brain does not en-
dure  our formal contribution holds: We clariﬁed that the drift diffusion model in its most common
variant (DDM) is consistent with  and even implicitly relies on  coherence-dependent estimates of
measurement reliability.
In the experiment of [11] coherences of the RDM stimulus were chosen randomly for each trial.
Consequently  participants could not predict the reliability of the RDM stimulus for the upcoming
trial  i.e.  the participants’ brains could not have had a good estimate of stimulus reliability at the
start of a trial. Yet  our analysis strongly suggests that coherence-dependent reliabilities were used
during decision making. The brain  therefore  must had adapted reliability within trials even on the
short timescale of a few hundred milliseconds. On the level of analysis dictated by the drift diffusion
model we cannot observe this adaptation. It only manifests itself as a change in mean drift that is
assumed to be constant within a trial. First models of simultaneous decision making and reliability
estimation have been suggested [21]  but clearly more work in this direction is needed to elucidate
the underlying mechanism used by the brain.
