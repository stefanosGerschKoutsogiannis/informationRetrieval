Abstract

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally  resulting in 17 mil-
lion deaths each year. Despite the availability of various treatment options  ex-
isting techniques based upon conventional medical knowledge often fail to iden-
tify patients who might have beneﬁted from more aggressive therapy. In this pa-
per  we describe and evaluate a novel unsupervised machine learning approach
for cardiac risk stratiﬁcation. The key idea of our approach is to avoid special-
ized medical knowledge  and assess patient risk using symbolic mismatch  a new
metric to assess similarity in long-term time-series activity. We hypothesize that
high risk patients can be identiﬁed using symbolic mismatch  as individuals in
a population with unusual long-term physiological activity. We describe related
approaches that build on these ideas to provide improved medical decision mak-
ing for patients who have recently suffered coronary attacks. We ﬁrst describe
how to compute the symbolic mismatch between pairs of long term electrocardio-
graphic (ECG) signals. This algorithm maps the original signals into a symbolic
domain  and provides a quantitative assessment of the difference between these
symbolic representations of the original signals. We then show how this measure
can be used with each of a one-class SVM  a nearest neighbor classiﬁer  and hier-
archical clustering to improve risk stratiﬁcation. We evaluated our methods on a
population of 686 cardiac patients with available long-term electrocardiographic
data. In a univariate analysis  all of the methods provided a statistically signiﬁcant
association with the occurrence of a major adverse cardiac event in the next 90
days. In a multivariate analysis that incorporated the most widely used clinical
risk variables  the nearest neighbor and hierarchical clustering approaches were
able to statistically signiﬁcantly distinguish patients with a roughly two-fold risk
of suffering a major adverse cardiac event in the next 90 days.

1 Introduction

In medicine  as in many other disciplines  decisions are often based upon a comparative analysis.
Patients are given treatments that worked in the past on apparently similar conditions. When given
simple data (e.g.  demographics  comorbidities  and laboratory values) such comparisons are rela-
tively straightforward. For more complex data  such as continuous long-term signals recorded during
physiological monitoring  they are harder. Comparing such time-series is made challenging by three
factors: the need to efﬁciently compare very long signals across a large number of patients  the need
to deal with patient-speciﬁc differences  and the lack of a priori knowledge associating signals with
long-term medical outcomes.
In this paper  we exploit three different ideas to address these problems.

• We address the problems related to scale by abstracting the raw signal into a sequence of
• We address the problems related to patient-speciﬁc differences by using a novel technique 
symbolic mismatch  that allows us to compare sequences of symbols drawn from distinct
alphabets. Symbolic mismatch compares long-term time-series by quantifying differences
between the morphology and frequency of prototypical functional units  and
• We address the problems related to lack of a priori knowledge using three different meth-
ods  each of which exploits the observation that high risk patients typically constitute a
small minority in a population.

In the remainder of this paper  we present our work in the context of risk stratiﬁcation for cardio-
vascular disease. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally and causes roughly
17 million deaths each year [3]. Despite improvements in survival rates  in the United States  one
in four men and one in three women still die within a year of a recognized ﬁrst heart attack [4].
This risk of death can be substantially lowered with an appropriate choice of treatment (e.g.  drugs
to lower cholesterol and blood pressure; operations such as coronary artery bypass graft; and med-
ical devices such as implantable cardioverter deﬁbrillators) [3]. However  matching patients with
treatments that are appropriate for their risk has proven to be challenging [5 6].
That existing techniques based upon conventional medical knowledge have proven inadequate for
risk stratiﬁcation leads us to explore methods with few a priori assumptions. We focus  in particular 
on identifying patients at elevated risk of major adverse cardiac events (death  myocardial infarction
and severe recurrent ischemia) following coronary attacks. This work uses long-term ECG signals
recorded during patient admission for ACS. These signals are routinely collected  potentially allow-
ing for the work presented here to be deployed easily without imposing additional needs on patients 
caregivers  or the healthcare infrastructure.
Fortunately  only a minority of cardiac patients experience serious subsequent adverse cardiovascu-
lar events. For example  cardiac mortality over a 90 day period following acute coronary syndrome
(ACS) was reported to be 1.79% for the SYMPHONY trial involving 14 970 patients [1] and 1.71%
for the DISPERSE2 trial with 990 patients [2]. The rate of myocardial infarction (MI) over the
same period for the two trials was 5.11% for the SYMPHONY trial and 3.54% for the DISPERSE2
trial. Our hypothesis is that these patients can be discovered as anomalies in the population  i.e. 
their physiological activity over long periods of time is dissimilar to the majority of the patients in
the population. In contrast to algorithms that require labeled training data  we propose identifying
these patients using unsupervised approaches based on three machine learning methods previously
reported in the literature: one-class support vector machines (SVMs)  nearest neighbor analysis  and
hierarchical clustering.
The main contributions of our work are: (1) we describe a novel unsupervised approach to cardio-
vascular risk stratiﬁcation that is complementary to existing clinical approaches  (2) we explore the
idea of similarity-based clinical risk stratiﬁcation where patients are categorized in terms of their
similarities rather than speciﬁc features based on prior knowledge  (3) we develop the hypothesis
that patients at future risk of adverse outcomes can be detected using an unsupervised approach as
outliers in a population  (4) we present symbolic mismatch  as a way to efﬁciently compare very long
time-series without ﬁrst reducing them to a set of features or requiring symbol registration across
patients  and (5) we present a rigorous evaluation of unsupervised similarity-based risk stratiﬁcation
using long-term data from nearly 700 patients with detailed admissions and follow-up data.

2 Symbolic Mismatch

We start by describing the process through which symbolic mismatch is measured on ECG signals.

2.1 Symbolization

As a ﬁrst step  the ECG signal zm for each patient m = 1; :::; n is symbolized using the technique
proposed by [7]. To segment the ECG signal into beats  we use two open-source QRS detection
algorithms [8 9]. QRS complexes are marked at locations where both algorithms agree. A variant
of dynamic time-warping (DTW) [7] is then used to quantify differences in morphology between

2

beats. Using this information  beats with distinct morphologies are partitioned into groups  with
each group assigned a unique label or symbol. This is done using a Max-Min iterative clustering
algorithm that starts by choosing the ﬁrst observation as the ﬁrst centroid  c1  and initializes the set
S of centroids to {c1}. During the i-th iteration  ci is chosen such that it maximizes the minimum
difference between ci and observations in S:

ci = arg max
x =2S

min
y2S

C(x; y)

(1)

where C(x; y) is the DTW difference between x and y. The set S is incremented at the end of each
iteration such that S = S ∪ ci.
The number of clusters discovered by Max-Min clustering is chosen by iterating until the maximized
minimum difference falls below a threshold (cid:18). At this point  the set S comprises the centroids for
the clustering process  and the ﬁnal assignment of beats to clusters proceeds by matching each beat
to its nearest centroid. Each set of beats assigned to a centroid constitutes a unique cluster. The ﬁnal
number of clusters  (cid:13)  obtained using this process depends on the separability of the underlying data.
The overall effect of the DTW-based partitioning of beats is to transform the original raw ECG
signal into a sequence of symbols  i.e.  into a sequence of labels corresponding to the different beat
morphology classes that occur in the signal. Our approach differs from the methods typically used
to annotate ECG signals in two ways. First  we avoid using specialized knowledge to partition
beats into known clinical classes. There is a set of generally accepted labels that cardiologists
use to differentiate distinct kinds of heart beats. However  in many cases  ﬁner distinctions than
provided by these labels can be clinically relevant [7]. Our use of beat clustering rather than beat
classiﬁcation allows us to infer characteristic morphology classes that capture these ﬁner-grained
distinctions. Second  our approach does not involve extracting features (e.g.  the length of the beat
or the amplitude of the P wave) from individual beats. Instead  our clustering algorithm compares
the entire raw morphology of pairs of beats. This approach is potentially advantageous  because it
does not assume a priori knowledge about what aspects of a beat are most relevant. It can also be
extended to other time-series data (e.g.  blood pressure and respiration waveforms).

2.2 Measuring Mismatch in Symbolic Representations

Denoting the set of symbol centroids for patient p as Sp and the set of frequencies with which these
symbols occur in the electrocardiogram as Fp (for patient q an analogous representation is adopted) 
we deﬁne the symbolic mismatch between the long-term ECG time-series for patients p and q as:

∑

∑

 p;q =

pi2Sp

qj2Sq

C(pi; qj)Fp[pi]Fq[qj]

(2)

where C(pi; qj) corresponds to the DTW cost of aligning the centroids of symbol classes pi and qj.
Intuitively  the symbolic mismatch between patients p and q corresponds to an estimate of the ex-
pected difference in morphology between any two randomly chosen beats from these patients. The
symbolic mismatch computation achieves this by weighting the difference between the centroids for
every pair of symbols for the patients by the frequencies with which these symbols occur.
An important feature of symbolic mismatch is that it avoids the need to set up a correspondence
between the symbols of patients p and q.
In contrast to cluster matching techniques [10 11] to
compare data for two patients by ﬁrst making an assignment from symbols in one patient to the
other  symbolic mismatch does not require any cross-patient registration of symbols.
Instead  it
performs weighted morphologic comparisons between all symbol centroids for patients p and q. As
a result  the symbolization process does not need to be restricted to well-deﬁned labels and is able
to use a richer set of patient-speciﬁc symbols that capture ﬁne-grained activity over long periods.

2.3 Spectrum Clipping and Adaptation for Kernel-based Methods

The formulation for symbolic mismatch in Equation 2 gives rise to a symmetric dissimilarity ma-
trix. For methods that are unable to work directly from dissimilarities  this can be transformed into a
similarity matrix using a generalized radial basis function. For both the dissimilarity and similarity
case  however  symbolic mismatch can produce a matrix that is indeﬁnite. This can be problematic

3

when using symbolic mismatch with kernel-based algorithms since the optimization problems be-
come non-convex and the underlying theory is invalidated. In particular  kernel-based classiﬁcation
methods require Mercer’s condition to be satisﬁed by a positive semi-deﬁnite kernel matrix [12].
This creates the need to transform the symbolic mismatch matrix before it can be used as a kernel in
these methods.
We use spectrum clipping to generalize the use of symbolic mismatch for classiﬁcation. This ap-
proach has been shown both theoretically and empirically to offer advantages over other strategies
(e.g.  spectrum ﬂipping  spectrum shifting  spectrum squaring  and the use of indeﬁnite kernels)
[13]. The symmetric mismatch matrix (cid:9) has an eigenvalue decomposition:

where U is an orthogonal matrix and (cid:3) is a diagonal matrix of real eigenvalues:

(cid:3) = diag((cid:21)1; :::; (cid:21)n)

(cid:9) = U T (cid:3)U

(3)

(4)

Spectrum clipping makes (cid:9) positive semi-deﬁnite by clipping all negative eigenvalues to zero. The
modiﬁed positive semi-deﬁnite symbolic mismatch matrix is then given by:

where:

(cid:9)clip = U T (cid:3)clipU

(cid:3)clip = diag(max((cid:21)1; 0); :::; max((cid:21)n; 0))

(5)

(6)

Using (cid:9)clip as a kernel matrix is then equivalent to using ((cid:3)clip)1=2ui as the i-th training sample.
Though we introduce spectrum clipping mainly for the purpose of broadening the applicability of
symbolic mismatch to kernel-based methods  this approach offers additional advantages. When the
negative eigenvalues of the similarity matrix are caused by noise  one can view spectrum clipping as
a denoising step [14]. The results of our experiments  presented later in this paper  support the view
of spectrum clipping being useful in a broader context.

3 Risk Stratiﬁcation Using Symbolic Mismatch

We now sketch three different approaches using symbolic mismatch to identify high risk patients in a
population. The following two sections contain an empirical evaluation of each. The ﬁrst approach
uses a one-class SVM and a symbolic mismatch similarity matrix obtained using a generalized
radial basis transformation. The other two approaches  nearest neighbor analysis and hierarchical
clustering  use the symbolic mismatch dissimilarity matrix. In each case  the symbolic mismatch
matrix is processed using spectrum clipping.

3.1 Classiﬁcation Approach

SVMs can applied to anomaly detection in a one-class setting [15] . This is done by mapping the
data into the feature space corresponding to the kernel and separating instances from the origin with
the maximum margin. To separate data from the origin  the following quadratic program is solved:

∥w∥2 +

min
w;(cid:24);p

1
2

1
vn

(cid:24)i − p

∑

i

(w · (cid:8)(zi)) ≥ p − (cid:24)i i = 1; :::; n (cid:24)i ≥ 0

subject to:

where v reﬂects the tradeoff between incorporating outliers and minimizing the support region.
For a new instance  the label is determined by evaluating which side of the hyperplane the instance
falls on in the feature space. The resulting predicted label in terms of the Lagrange multipliers (cid:11)i
and the spectrum clipped symbolic mismatch similarity matrix (cid:9)clip is then:

^yj = sgn(

(cid:11)i(cid:9)clip(i; j) − p)

∑

i

(7)

(8)

(9)

We apply this approach to train a one-class SVM on all patients. Patients outside the enclosing
boundary are labeled anomalies. The parameter v can be varied to control the size of this group.

3.2 Nearest Neighbor Approach

Our second approach is based on the concept of nearest neighbor analysis. The assumption underly-
ing this approach is that normal data instances occur in dense neighborhoods  while anomalies occur
far from their closest neighbors.
We use an approach similar to [16]. The anomaly score of each patient’s long-term time-series is
computed as the sum of its distances from the time-series for its k-nearest neighbors  as measured
by symbolic mismatch. Patients with anomaly scores exceeding a threshold (cid:18) are labeled anomalies.

3.3 Clustering Approach

Our third approach is based on hierarchical clustering. We place each patient in a separate cluster 
and then proceed in each iteration to merge the two clusters that are most similar to each other. The
distance between two clusters is deﬁned as the average of the pairwise symbolic mismatch of the
patients in each cluster. The clustering process terminates when it enters the region of diminishing
returns (i.e.  at the ’knee’ of the curve corresponding to the distance of clusters merged together at
each iteration). At this point  all patients outside the largest cluster are labeled as anomalies.

4 Evaluation Methodology

We evaluated our work on patients enrolled in the DISPERSE2 trial [2]. Patients in the study were
admitted to a hospital with non-ST-elevation ACS. Three lead continuous ECG monitoring (LifeCard
CF / Pathﬁnder  DelMar Reynolds / Spacelabs  Issaqua WA) was performed for a median duration
of four days at a sampling rate of 128 Hz. The endpoints of cardiovascular death  myocardial
infarction and severe recurrent ischemia were adjudicated by a blinded Clinical Events Committee
for a median follow-up period of 60 days. The maximum follow-up was 90 days. Data from 686
patients was available after removal of noise-corrupted signals. During the follow-up there were
14 cardiovascular deaths  28 myocardial infarctions  and 13 cases of severe recurrent ischemia. We
deﬁne a major adverse cardiac event to be any of these three adverse events.
We studied the effectiveness of combining symbolic mismatch with each of classiﬁcation  near-
est neighbor analysis and clustering in identifying a high risk group of patients. Consistent with
other clinical studies to evaluate methods for risk stratiﬁcation in the setting of ACS [17]  we clas-
siﬁed patients in the highest quartile as the high risk group. For the classiﬁcation approach  this
corresponded to choosing v such that the group of patients lying outside the enclosing boundary
constituted roughly 25% of the population. For the nearest neighbor approach we investigated all
odd values of k from 3 to 9  and patients with anomaly scores in the top 25% of the population were
classiﬁed as being at high risk. For the clustering approach  the varying sizes of the clusters merged
together at each step made it difﬁcult to select a high risk quartile. Instead  patients lying outside
the largest cluster were categorized as being at risk. In the tests reported later in this paper  this
group contained roughly 23% the patients in the population. We used the LIBSVM implementation
for our one-class SVM. Both the nearest neighbor and clustering approaches were carried out using
MATLAB implementations.
We employed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to compare the rates for major adverse cardiac events
between patients declared to be at high and low risk. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% conﬁdence in-
terval (CI) were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. The predictions of
each approach were studied in univariate models  and also in multivariate models that additionally
included other clinical risk variables (age≥65 years  gender  smoking history  hypertension  dia-
betes mellitus  hyperlipidemia  history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD)  history
of coronary heart disease (CHD)  previous MI  previous angina  ST depression on admission  index
diagnosis of MI) as well as ECG risk metrics proposed in the past (heart rate variability (HRV)  heart
rate turbulence (HRT)  and deceleration capacity (DC)) [18].

5 Results

5.1 Univariate Results

Results of univariate analysis for all three unsupervised symbolic mismatch-based approaches are
presented in Table 1. The predictions from all methods showed a statistically signiﬁcant (i.e.  p <
0:05) association with major adverse cardiac events following ACS. The results in Table 1 can
be interpreted as roughly a doubled rate of adverse outcomes per unit time in patients identiﬁed as
being at high risk by the nearest neighbor and clustering approaches. For the classiﬁcation approach 
patients identiﬁed as being at high risk had a nearly 40% increased risk.
For comparison  we also include the univariate association of the other clinical and ECG risk vari-
ables in our study (Table 2). Both the nearest neighbor and clustering approaches had a higher hazard
ratio in this patient population than any of the other variables studied. Of the clinical risk variables 
only age was found to be signiﬁcantly associated on univariate analysis with major cardiac events
after ACS. Diabetes (p=0.072) was marginally outside the 5% level of signiﬁcance. Of the ECG risk
variables  both HRT and DC showed a univariate association with major adverse cardiac events in
this population. These results are consistent with the clinical literature on these risk metrics.

5.2 Multivariate Results

We measured the correlation between the predictions of the unsupervised symbolic mismatch-based
approaches and both the clinical and ECG risk variables. All of the unsupervised approaches had
low correlation with both sets of variables (R ≤ 0:2). This suggests that the results of these novel
approaches can be usefully combined with results of existing approaches.
On multivariate analysis  both the nearest neighbor approach and the clustering approach were inde-
pendent predictors of adverse outcomes (Table 3). In our study  the nearest neighbor approach (for
k > 3) had the highest hazard ratio on both univariate and multivariate analysis. Both the nearest
neighbor and clustering approaches predicted patients with an approximately two-fold increased risk
of adverse outcomes. This increased risk did not change much even after adjusting for other clinical
and ECG risk variables.

of the approaches showed a statistically signiﬁcant association with the study endpoint in any of the
multivariate models including other clinical risk variables when spectrum clipping was not used.

5.3 Effect of Spectrum Clipping

We also investigated the effect of spectrum clipping on the performance of our different risk strat-
iﬁcation approaches. Table 4 presents the associations when spectrum clipping was not used. For
all three methods  performance was worse without the use of spectrum clipping  although the effect
was small for the one-class SVM case.

6 Related Work

Most previous work on comparing signals in terms of their raw samples (e.g.  metrics such as
dynamic time warping  longest common subsequence  edit distance with real penalty  sequence
weighted alignment  spatial assembling distance  threshold queries) [19] focuses on relatively short
time-series. This is due to the runtime of these methods (quadratic for many methods) and the need
to reason in terms of the frequency and dynamics of higher-level signal constructs (as opposed to
individual samples) when studying systems over long periods.
Most prior research on comparing long-term time-series focuses instead on extracting speciﬁc fea-
tures from long-term signals and quantifying the differences between these features. In the context
of cardiovascular disease  long-term ECG is often reduced to features (e.g.  mean heart rate or heart
rate variability) and compared in terms of these features. These approaches  unlike our symbolic
mismatch based approaches  draw upon signiﬁcant a priori knowledge. Our belief was that for
applications like risk stratifying patients for major cardiac events  focusing on a set of specialized
features leads to important information being potentially missed. In our work  we focus instead
on developing an approach that avoids use of signiﬁcant a priori knowledge by comparing the raw
morphology of long-term time-series. We propose doing this in a computationally efﬁcient and
systematic way through symbolization. While this use of symbolization represents a lossy compres-
sion of the original signal  the underlying DTW-based process of quantifying differences between
long-term time-series remains grounded in the comparison of raw morphology.
Symbolization maps the comparison of long-term time-series into the domain of sequence compar-
ison. There is an extensive body of prior work focusing on the comparison of sequential or string
data. Algorithms based on measuring the edit distance between strings are widely used in disci-
plines such as computational biology  but are typically restricted to comparisons of short sequences
because of their computational complexity. Research on the use of proﬁle hidden Markov models
[20 21] to optimize recognition of binary labeled sequences is more closely related to our work. This
work focuses on learning the parameters of a hidden Markov model that can represent approxima-
tions of sequences and can be used to score other sequences. Such approaches require large amounts
of data or good priors to train the hidden Markov models. Computing forward and backward prob-

7

abilities from the Baum-Welch algorithm is also very computationally intensive. Other research in
this area focuses on mismatch tree-based kernels [22]  which use the mismatch tree data structure
[23] to quantify the difference between two sequences based on the approximate occurrence of ﬁxed
length subsequences within them. Similar to this approach is work on using a “bag of motifs” rep-
resentation [24]  which provides a more ﬂexible representation than ﬁxed length subsequences but
usually requires prior knowledge of motifs in the data [24].
In contrast to these efforts  we use a simple computationally efﬁcient approach to compare sym-
bolic sequences without prior knowledge. Most importantly  our approach helps address the situ-
ation where symbolizing long-term time-series in a patient-speciﬁc manner leads to the symbolic
sequences from different alphabets [25]. In this case  hidden Markov models  mismatch trees or a
“bag of motifs” approach trained on one patient cannot be easily used to score the sequences for
other patients. Instead  any comparative approach must maintain a hard or soft registration of sym-
bols across individuals. Symbolic mismatch complements existing work on sequence comparison
by using a measure that quantiﬁes differences across patients while retaining information on how
the symbols for these patients differ.
Finally  we distinguish our work from earlier method for ECG-based risk stratiﬁcation. These meth-
ods typically calculate a particular pre-deﬁned feature from the raw ECG signal  and to use it to rank
patients along a risk continuum. Our approach  focusing on detecting patients with high symbolic
mismatch relative to other patients in the population  is orthogonal to the use of specialized high risk
features along two important dimensions. First  it does not require the presence of signiﬁcant prior
knowledge. For the cardiovascular care  we only assume that ECG signals from patients who are
at high risk differ from those of the rest of the population. There are no speciﬁc assumptions about
the nature of these differences. Second  the ability to partition patients into groups with similar
ECG characteristics and potentially common risk proﬁles potentially allows for a more ﬁne-grained
understanding of a how a patient’s future health may evolve over time. Matching patients to past
cases with similar ECG signals could lead to more accurate assignments of risk scores for particular
events such as death and recurring heart attacks.

7 Discussion

In this paper  we described a novel unsupervised learning approach to cardiovascular risk stratiﬁca-
tion that is complementary to existing clinical approaches.
We proposed using symbolic mismatch to quantify differences in long-term physiological time-
series. Our approach uses a symbolic transformation to measure changes in the morphology and
frequency of prototypical functional units observed over long periods in two signals. Symbolic
mismatch avoids feature extraction and deals with inter-patient differences in a parameter-less way.
We also explored the hypothesis that high risk patients in a population can be identiﬁed as individuals
with anomalous long-term signals. We developed multiple comparative approaches to detect such
patients  and evaluated these methods in a real-world application of risk stratiﬁcation for major
adverse cardiac events following ACS.
Our results suggest that symbolic mismatch-based comparative approaches may have clinical utility
in identifying high risk patients  and can provide information that is complementary to existing
clinical risk variables. In particular  we note that the hazard ratios we report are typically considered
clinically meaningful. In a different study of 118 variables in 15 000 post-ACS patients with 90 day
follow-up similar to our population  [1] did not ﬁnd any variables with a hazard ratio greater than
2.00. We observed a similar result in our patient population  where all of the existing clinical and
ECG risk variables had a hazard ratio less than 2.00. In contrast to this  our nearest neighbor-based
approach achieved a hazard ratio of 2.28  even after being adjusted for existing risk measures.
Our study has limitations. While our decision to compare the morphology and frequency of pro-
totypical functional units leads to a measure that is computationally efﬁcient on large volumes of
data  this process does not capture information related to the dynamics of these prototypical units.
We also observe that all three of the comparative approaches investigated in our study focus only on
identifying patients who are anomalies. While we believe that symbolic mismatch may have further
use in supervised learning  this hypothesis needs to be evaluated more fully in future work.
