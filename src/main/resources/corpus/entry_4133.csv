Abstract

How do humans perceive the speed of a coherent motion stimulus that contains
motion energy in multiple spatiotemporal frequency bands? Here we tested the
idea that perceived speed is the result of an integration process that optimally com-
bines speed information across independent spatiotemporal frequency channels.
We formalized this hypothesis with a Bayesian observer model that combines the
likelihood functions provided by the individual channel responses (cues). We ex-
perimentally validated the model with a 2AFC speed discrimination experiment
that measured subjects’ perceived speed of drifting sinusoidal gratings with differ-
ent contrasts and spatial frequencies  and of various combinations of these single
gratings. We found that the perceived speeds of the combined stimuli are inde-
pendent of the relative phase of the underlying grating components. The results
also show that the discrimination thresholds are smaller for the combined stimuli
than for the individual grating components  supporting the cue combination hy-
pothesis. The proposed Bayesian model ﬁts the data well  accounting for the full
psychometric functions of both simple and combined stimuli. Fits are improved if
we assume that the channel responses are subject to divisive normalization. Our
results provide an important step toward a more complete model of visual mo-
tion perception that can predict perceived speeds for coherent motion stimuli of
arbitrary spatial structure.

Introduction

Low contrast stimuli are perceived to move slower than high contrast ones [17]. This effect can
be explained with a Bayesian observer model that assumes a prior distribution with a peak at slow
speeds [18  8  15]. This assumption has been veriﬁed by reconstructing subjects’ individual prior
distributions from psychophysical data [16]. Based on a noisy sensory measurement m of the true
stimulus speed s the Bayesian observer model computes the posterior probability

p(s|m) =

p(m|s)p(s)

p(m)

(1)

by multiplying the likelihood function p(m|s) with the probability p(s) representing the observer’s
prior expectation. If the measurement is unreliable (e.g. if stimulus contrast is low)  the likelihood
function is broad and the posterior probability distribution is shifted toward the peak of the prior 
resulting in a perceived speed that is biased toward slow speeds. While this model is able to account
for changes in perceived speed as a function of different internal noise levels (modulated by stimulus
contrast)  it does not possess the power to predict the inﬂuence of other factors known to modulate
perceived speed such as for example the spatial frequency of the stimulus [14  10  2].

determines how humans perceive its speed s. b) Spatiotemporal energy diagram for motion in a
given direction (i.e. speed) showing individual spatiotemporal frequency channels (white circles).
A stimulus that contains spatial frequencies of 0.5 c/deg and 1.5 c/deg and moves with a speed
of 2 deg/s will trigger responses (cid:126)r = {r1  r2} in two corresponding channels (red circles). The
uncertainty about s given the response vector (cid:126)r is expressed in the joint likelihood function p((cid:126)r|s).

In this paper we make a step toward a more general observer model of visual speed perception that 
in the longterm  will allow us to predict perceived speed for arbitrary complex stimuli (Fig. 1a).
Inspired by physiological and psychophysical evidence we present an extension of the standard
Bayesian model (Eq. 1)  which decomposes complex motion stimuli into simpler components pro-
cessed in separate spatiotemporal frequency channels. Based on the motion energy model [1  12] 
we assume that each channel is sensitive to a narrow spatiotemporal frequency band. The observed
speed of a stimulus is then a result of combining the sensory evidence provided by these individual
channels with a prior expectation for slow speeds. Optimal integration of different sources of sen-
sory evidence has been well documented in cue-combination experiments using cues of different
modalities (see e.g. [4  7]). Here we employ an analogous approach by treating the responses of
individual spatiotemporal frequency channels as independent cues about a stimulus’ motion.
We validated the model against the data of a series of psychophysical experiments in which we mea-
sured how humans’ speed percept of coherent motion depends on the stimulus energy in different
spatial frequency bands. Stimuli consisted of drifting sinusoidal gratings at two different spatial
frequencies and contrasts  and various combinations of these single gratings. For a given stimulus
speed s  single gratings target only one channel while the combined stimuli target multiple chan-
nels. A joint ﬁt to the psychometric functions of all conditions demonstrates that our new model
well captures human behavior both in terms of perceptual biases and discrimination thresholds.

2 Bayesian model

To deﬁne the new model  we start with the stimulus. We consider s to be the speed of locally coherent
and translational stimulus motion (Fig. 1a). This motion can be represented by its power spectrum in
spatiotemporal frequency space. For a given motion direction the energy lies in a two-dimensional
plane spanned by a temporal frequency axis ωt and a spatial frequency axis ωs and is constrained
to coordinates that satisfy s = ωt/ωs (Fig. 1b; red dashed line). According to the motion energy
model  we assume that the visual system contains motion units that are tuned to speciﬁc locations in
this plane [1  12]. A coherent motion stimulus with speed s and multiple spatial frequencies ωs will
therefore drive only those units whose tuning curves are centered at coordinates (ωs  ωss).
We formulate our Bayesian observer model in terms of k spatiotemporal frequency channels  each
tuned to a narrow spatiotemporal frequency band (Fig. 1b). A moving stimulus will elicit a total
response (cid:126)r = [r1  r2  ...  rk] from these channels. The response of each channel provides a likelihood

moving stimulus with speed s is decomposed and processed in separate channels that are sensitive to
energy in speciﬁc spatiotemporal frequency bands. Based on the channel response ri we formulate
a likelihood function p(ri|s) for each channel. The posterior distribution p(s|(cid:126)r) is deﬁned by the
combination of the likelihoods with a prior distribution p(s). Here we assume perceived speed ˆs to
be the mode of the posterior. We consider a model with and without response normalization across
channels (red dashed line).

of an Bayesian observer model that performs optimal integration as

p(s|(cid:126)r) ∝ p(s)

p(ri|s) .

We rely on the results of Stocker and Simoncelli [16] for the characterization of the likelihood func-
tions and the speed prior. Likelihoods are assumed to be Gaussians when considered in a transformed
logarithmic speed space of the form s = log(1 + slinear/s0)  where s0 is a small constant [9]. If we
assume that each channel represents a large number of similarly tuned neurons with Poisson ﬁring
statistics  then the average channel likelihood is centered on the value of s for which the activity in
the channel peaks  and the width of the likelihood σi is inversely proportional to the square-root of
the channel’s response [11]. Also based on [16] we locally approximate the logarithm of the speed
prior as linear  thus log(p(s)) = as + b.
For reasons of simplicity and without loss of generality  we focus on the case where the stimulus
activates two channels with responses (cid:126)r = [ri]  i ∈ {1  2}. Given our assumptions  the likelihoods
√
are normal distributions with mean µ(ri) and standard deviation σi ∝ 1/
ri. The posterior (2) can
therefore be written as

p(s|(cid:126)r) ∝ exp

The noisy observer’s percept is fully determined by Eqs. (5) and (6). By a similar derivation it is
also easy to show that for a single active channel the distribution has mean E (cid:104)ˆs|s(cid:105) = s + aσ2
1 and
variance var (cid:104)ˆs|s(cid:105) = σ2
1.
The model makes the following predictions: First  the variance of the speed estimates (i.e.  percepts)
for stimuli that activate both channels is always smaller than the variances of estimates that are
based on each of the channel responses alone (σ2
2). This improved reliability is a hallmark
of optimal cue combination as has been demonstrated for cross-modal integration [4  7]. Second 
because of the slow speed prior a is negative  and perceived speeds are more biased toward slower
speeds the larger the sensory uncertainty. As a result  the perceived speed of combined stimuli that
activate both channels is always faster than the percepts based on each of the individual channel
responses alone. Finally  the model predicts that the perceived speed of a combined stimulus solely
depends on the responses of the channels to its constituent components  and is therefore independent
of the relative phase of the components we combined [5].

2.1 Response normalization

So far we assumed that the channels do not interact  i.e.  their responses are independent of the num-
ber of active channels and the overall activity in the system. Here we extend our proposal with the
additional hypothesis that channels interact via divisive normalization. Divisive normalization [6]
has been considered one of the canonical neural computations responsible for e.g.  contrast gain con-
trol  efﬁcient coding  attention or surround suppression [13] (see [3] for a comprehensive review).
Here we assume that the response of an individual channel ri is normalized such that its normalized
response r∗

i is given by

Normalization typically increases the contrast (i.e.  the relative difference) between the individual
channel responses for increasing values of the exponent n. For large n it typically acts like a winner-
takes-all mechanism. Note that normalization affects only the responses ri  thus modulating the
width of the individual likelihood functions. The integration based on the normalized responses r∗
i
remains optimal (see Fig. 2). By explicitly modeling the encoding of visual motion in spatiotemporal
frequency channels  we already extended the Bayesian model of speed perception toward a more
physiological interpretation. Response normalization is one more step in this direction.

3 Results

In the second part of this paper we test the validity of our model with and without channel normaliza-
tion against data from a psychophysical two alternative forced choice (2AFC) speed discrimination
experiment.

3.1 Speed discrimination experiment

Seven subjects performed a 2AFC visual speed discrimination task. In each trial  subjects were pre-
sented for 1250ms with a reference and a test stimulus on either side of a ﬁxation mark (eccentricity

phase conﬁguration (0 deg and 60 deg phase  respectively) [5]. The red bar indicates that the two

frequencies. We used these two phase-combinations to test whether the channel hypothesis is valid
or not.

6 deg  size 4 deg). Both stimuli were drifting gratings  both drifting either leftwards or rightwards
at different speeds. Motion directions and the order of the gratings were randomly selected for each
trial. After stimulus presentation  a brief ﬂash appeared on the left or right side of the ﬁxation mark
and subjects had to answer whether the grating that was presented on the indicated side was moving
faster or slower than the grating on the other side. This procedure was chosen in order to prevent
potential decision biases.
The stimulus test set comprised 10 stimuli. Four of these stimuli were simple sinewave gratings of
a single spatial frequency  either ωs = 0.5 or 3ωs = 1.5 c/deg. The low frequency test stimulus
had a contrast of 22.5%  while the three higher frequency stimuli had contrasts 7.5  22.5 and 67.5% 
respectively. The other six stimuli were pair-wise combinations of the single frequency gratings
(Fig. 3)  combined in either a ”peaks-add” or a ”peaks-subtract” phase conﬁguration [5] (i.e. 0 deg
and 60 deg phase). All test stimuli were drifting at a speed of 2 deg/s. The reference stimulus was
a broadband stimulus stimulus whose speed was regulated by an adaptive staircase procedure. Each
of the 10 stimulus conditions were run for 190 trials. Data from all seven subjects were combined.
The simple stimuli were designed to target individual spatiotemporal frequency channels while the
combined stimuli were meant to target two channels simultaneously. The two phase conﬁgura-
tions (peaks-add and peaks-subtract) were used to test the multiple channel hypothesis: if combined
stimuli are decomposed and processed in separate channels  their perceived speeds should be in-
dependent of the phase conﬁguration. In particular  the difference in overall contrast of the two
conﬁgurations should not affect perceived speed (Fig 3).
Matching speeds (PSEs) and relative discrimination thresholds (Weber-fraction) were extracted from
a maximum-likelihood ﬁt of each of the 10 psychometric functions with a cumulative Gaussian.
Fig. 4a b shows the extracted discrimination thresholds and the relative matching speed  respec-
tively. The data faithfully reproduce the general prediction of the Bayesian model for speed per-
ception [16] that perceived speed decreases with increasing uncertainty  which can be nicely seen
from the inverse relationship between matching speeds and discrimination thresholds for each of the
different test stimuli. We found no signiﬁcant difference in perceived speeds and thresholds between
the combined grating stimuli in ”peaks-add” and ”peaks-subtract” conﬁguration (Fig. 4a b; right) 
despite the fact that the effective contrast of both conﬁgurations differs signiﬁcantly (by 30  22 and
11% for the {22.5  7.5}  {22.5  22.5} and {22.5  67.5}% contrast conditions  respectively). This
suggests that the perceived speed of combined stimuli is independent of the relative phase between
the individual stimulus components  and therefore is processed in independent channels.

3.2 Model ﬁts

In order to ﬁt the model observer to the data  we assumed that on every trial of the 2AFC task  the
observer ﬁrst makes individual estimates of the test and the reference speeds [ˆst  ˆsr] according to
the corresponding distributions p(ˆs|s) (see Section 2)  and then  based on these estimates  decides

from 100 bootstrapped samples of the data. For the single frequency gratings  the perceived speed
increases with contrast as predicted by the standard Bayesian model. For the combined stimuli  there
is no signiﬁcant difference (based on 95% conﬁdence intervals) in perceived speeds between the
combined grating stimuli in ”peaks-add” and ”peaks-subtract” conﬁguration. The Bayesian model
with normalized responses (red line) better accounts for the data than the model without interaction

is described by the cumulative probability distribution

where p(ˆsr|sr) and p(ˆst|st) are the distributions of speed estimates for the reference and the test
stimulus according to our Bayesian observer model. The model without normalization has six pa-

widths  the reference response rref and the local slope of the prior a.1 The model with normalization
has two additional parameters n1 and n2  reﬂecting the exponents of the normalization in each of
the two channels (Eq. 7).

maximum-likelihood optimization procedure. Figure 5 shows the ﬁtted psychometric functions for
both models as well as a generic cumulative Gaussian ﬁt to the data. From these ﬁts we extracted the
matching speeds (PSEs) and relative discrimination thresholds (Weber-fractions) shown in Fig. 4.
In general  the Bayesian model is quite well supported by the data. In particular  the data reﬂect
the inverse relationship between relative matching speeds and discrimination thresholds predicted
by the slow-speed prior of the model. The model with response normalization  however  better cap-
tures subjects’ precepts in particular in conditions where very low contrast stimuli were combined.
This is evident from a visual comparison of the full psychometric functions (Fig. 5) as well as the
extracted discrimination thresholds and matching speeds (Fig. 4). This impression is supported by
a log-likelihood ratio in favor of the model with normalized responses. Computing the Akaike In-
formation Criterion (AIC) furthermore reveals that this advantage is not due to the larger number
of free parameters of the normalization model with an advantage of ∆AIC = 127 (with signiﬁcance
p = 10e − 28) in favor of the latter. Further support of the normalized model comes form the ﬁt-
ted parameter values: for the model with no normalization  the response level of the highest contrast
stimulus r4 was not well constrained2 (r1=6.18  r2=5.50  r3=8.69  r4= 6e+07  rref=11.66  a=-1.83) 
while the ﬁt to the normalized model led to more reasonable parameter values (r1=10.33  r2=9.96 
r3=11.99  r4=37.73  rref=13.44  n1=2e-16  n2=6.8  a=-3.39). In particular  the ﬁt prior slope pa-
rameter is in good agreement with values from a previous study [16]. Note that the exponent n1 is
not well-constrained because the stimulus set only included one contrast level for the low-frequency
channel.
The results suggest that the perceived speed of a combined stimulus can be accurately described
as an optimal combination of sensory information provided by individual spatiotemporal frequency
channels that interact via response normalization.

4 Discussion

We have shown that human visual speed perception can be accurately described by a Bayesian
observer model that optimally combines sensory information from independent channels  each sen-
sitive to motion energies in a speciﬁc spatiotemporal frequency band. Our model expands the previ-
ously proposed Bayesian model of speed perception [16]. It no longer assumes a single likelihood
function affected by stimulus contrast but rather considers the combination of likelihood functions
based on the motion energies in different spatiotemporal frequency channels. This allows the model
to account for stimuli with more complex spatial structures.

of drifting sinewave gratings at different spatial frequencies and combinations thereof. Subjects’
perceived speeds of the combined stimuli were independent of the phase conﬁguration of the con-
stituent sinewave gratings even though different phases resulted in different overall contrast values.
This supports the hypothesis that perceived speed is processed across multiple spatiotemporal fre-
quency channels (Graham and Nachmias used a similar approach to demonstrate the existence of
individual spatial frequency channels [5]). The proposed observer model provided a good ﬁt to
the data  but the ﬁt was improved when the channel responses were assumed to be subject to nor-
malization by the overall channel response. Considering that divisive normalization is arguably an
ubiquitous process in neural representations  we see this result as a consequence of our attempt to
formulate Bayesian observer models at a level that is closer to a physiological description. Note
that we consider the integration of the sensory information still optimal albeit based on the normal-
ized responses r∗
i . Future experiments that will test more stimulus combinations will help to further
improve the characterization of the channel responses and interactions.
Although we did not discuss alternative models  it is apparent that the presented data eliminates
some obvious candidates. For example  both a winner-take-all model that only uses the sensory in-
formation from the most reliable channel  or an averaging model that equally weighs each channel’s
response independent of its reliability  would make predictions that signiﬁcantly diverge from the
data. Both models would not predict a decrease in sensory uncertainty for the combined stimuli 
which is a key feature of optimal cue-combination. This decrease is nicely reﬂected in the measured
decrease in discrimination thresholds for the combined stimuli when the thresholds for both indi-
vidual gratings were approximately the same (Fig. 4b). Note  that because of the slow speed prior 
a Bayesian model predicts that the perceived speed are inversely proportional to the discrimination
threshold  a prediction that is well supported by our data. The ﬁtted model parameters are also in
agreement with previous accounts of the estimated shape of the speed prior: the slope of the linear
approximation of the log-prior probability density is negative and comparable to previously reported
values [16].
In this paper we focused on speed perception. However  there is substantial evidence that the visual
system in general decomposes complex stimuli into their simpler constituents. The problem of how
the scattered information is then integrated into a coherent percept poses many interesting questions
with regard to the optimality of this integration across modalities [4  7]. Our study generalizes cue-
integration to the pooling of information within a single perceptual modality. Here we provide a
behavioral account for both discrimination thresholds and matching speeds by directly estimating
the parameters of the likelihoods and the speed prior from psychophysical data.
Finally  the fact that the Bayesian model can account for both the perception of simple and complex
stimuli speaks for its generality. In the long term  the goal is to be able to predict the perceived
motion for an arbitrarily complex natural stimulus  and we believe the proposed model is a step in
this direction.
