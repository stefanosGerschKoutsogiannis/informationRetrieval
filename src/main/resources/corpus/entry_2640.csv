Abstract

Simultaneous recordings of the activity of large neural populations are extremely
valuable as they can be used to infer the dynamics and interactions of neurons in
a local circuit  shedding light on the computations performed. It is now possible
to measure the activity of hundreds of neurons using 2-photon calcium imaging.
However  many computations are thought to involve circuits consisting of thou-
sands of neurons  such as cortical barrels in rodent somatosensory cortex. Here we
contribute a statistical method for “stitching” together sequentially imaged sets of
neurons into one model by phrasing the problem as ﬁtting a latent dynamical sys-
tem with missing observations. This method allows us to substantially expand the
population-sizes for which population dynamics can be characterized—beyond
the number of simultaneously imaged neurons. In particular  we demonstrate us-
ing recordings in mouse somatosensory cortex that this method makes it possible
to predict noise correlations between non-simultaneously recorded neuron pairs.

Introduction

The computation performed by a neural circuit is a product of the properties of single neurons in the
circuit and their connectivity. Simultaneous measurements of the collective dynamics of all neurons
in a neural circuit will help us understand their function and test theories of neural computation.
However  experimental limitations make it difﬁcult to measure the joint activity of large populations
of neurons. Recent progress in 2-photon calcium imaging now allows for recording of the activ-
ity of hundreds of neurons nearly simultaneously [1  2]. However  in neocortex where circuits or
subnetworks can span thousands of neurons  current imaging techniques are still inadequate.
We present a computational method to more effectively leverage currently available experimental
technology. To illustrate our method consider the following example: A whisker barrel in the mouse
somatosensory cortex consists of a few thousand neurons responding to stimuli from one whisker.
Modern microscopes can only image a small fraction—a few hundred neurons—of this circuit. But
since nearby neurons couple strongly to one another [3]  by moving the microscope to nearby loca-
tions  one can expect to image neurons which are directly coupled to the ﬁrst population of neurons.
In this paper we address the following question: Could we characterize the joint dynamics of the
ﬁrst and second populations of neurons  even though they were not imaged simultaneously? Can we
estimate correlations in variability across the two populations? Surprisingly  the answer is yes.
We propose a statistical tool for “stitching” together measurements from multiple partial observa-
tions of the same neural circuit. We show that we can predict the correlated dynamics of large

populations of neurons even if many of the neurons have not been imaged simultaneously. In sen-
sory cortical neurons  where large variability in the evoked response is observed [4  5]  our model
can successfully predict the magnitude of (so-called) noise correlations between non-simultaneously
recorded neurons. Our method can help us build data-driven models of large cortical circuits and
help test theories of circuit function.
Related recent research. Numerous studies have addressed the question of inferring functional
connectivity from 2-photon imaging data [6  7] or electrophysiological measurements [8  9  10  11].
These approaches include detailed models of the relationship between ﬂuorescence measure-
ments  calcium transients and spiking activity [6] as well as model-free information-theoretic ap-
proaches [7]. However  these studies do not attempt to infer functional connections between
non-simultaneously observed neurons. On the other hand  a few studies have presented statisti-
cal methods for dealing with sub-sampled observations of neural activity or connectivity  but these
approaches are not applicable to our problem: A recent study [12] presented a method for predict-
ing noise correlations between non-simultaneously recorded neurons  but this method requires the
strong assumption that noise correlations are monotonically related to stimulus correlations. [13]
presented an algorithm for latent GLMs  but this algorithm does not scale to the population sizes
of interest here. [14] presented a method for inferring synaptic connections on dendritic trees from
sub-sampled voltage observations. In this setting  one typically obtains a measurement from each
location every few imaging frames  and it is therefore possible to interpolate these observations.
In contrast  in our application  imaging sessions are of much longer duration than the time-scale
of neural dynamics. Finally  [15] presented a statistical framework for reconstructing anatomical
connectivity by superimposing partial connectivity matrices derived from ﬂuorescent markers.

2 Methods

Our goal is to estimate a joint model of the activity of a neural population which captures the corre-
lation structure and stimulus selectivity of the population from partial observations of the population
activity. We model the problem as ﬁtting a latent dynamical system with missing observations. In
principle  any latent dynamical system model [13] can be used—here we demonstrate our main point
using the simple linear gaussian dynamical system for its computational tractability.

Linear dynamics. We denote by xk the activity of N neurons in the population on recording session
k  and model its dynamics as linear with Gaussian innovations in discrete time

Here  the N × N coupling matrix A models correlations across neurons and time. An entry Aij
being non-zero implies that activity of neuron j at time t has a statistical inﬂuence on the activity of
neuron i on the next time-step t + 1  but does not necessarily imply a direct synaptic connection. For
this reason  entries of A are usually referred to as the ‘functional’ (rather than anatomical) couplings
or connectivity of the population. The entries of A also shape trial-to-trial variability which is
correlated across neurons  i.e. noise-correlations. Further  we include an external  observed stimulus
t (of dimension Nu) as well as receptive ﬁelds B (of size N × Nu) which model the stimulus

other inﬂuences not modeled explicitly) using zero-mean innovations ηt  which are Gaussian i.i.d.
with covariance matrix Q  assuming the latter to be diagonal (see below for how our framework also
can allow for correlated noise). The mean x0 and covariance Q0 of the initial state xk
0 were chosen
such that the system is stationary (apart from the stimulus contribution Buk
t )  i.e. x0 = 0 and Q0
satisﬁes the Lyapunov equation Q0 = AQ0A(cid:62) + Q.
For the sake of simplicity  we work directly in the space of continuous valued imaging measurements
(rather than on the underlying spiking activity)  i.e. xk
t models the relative calcium ﬂuorescence sig-
nal. While this model does not capture the nonlinear and non-Gaussian cascade of neural couplings 
calcium dynamics  ﬂuorescence measurements and imaging noise [16  6]  we will show that this
model nevertheless is able to predict correlations across non-simultaneously observed pairs of neu-
rons.
Incomplete observations. In each imaging session k we measure the activity of Nk neurons simul-
taneously  where Nk is smaller than the total number of neurons N. Since these measurements are
noisy and incomplete observations of the full state vector  the true underlying activity of all neurons
t is treated as a latent variable. The vector of the Nk measurements at time t in session k is denoted
xk
as yk

t and is related to the underlying population activity by

where the ‘measurement matrix’ C k is of size Nk × N. Further assuming that the recording sites
correspond to identiﬁed cells (which typically is the case for 2-photon calcium imaging)  we can
assume C k to be known and of the following form: The element C k
ij is 1 if neuron j of the population
is being recorded from on session k (as the i-th recording site); the remaining elements of C k are
0. The measurement noise is modeled as a Gaussian random variable t with covariance R  and
the parameter d captures a constant offset. One can also envisage using our model with dimensions
t which are never observed– such latent dimensions would then model correlated noise or the
of xk
input from unobserved neurons into the population [17  18].
Fitting the model. Our goal is to estimate the parameters (A  B  Q  R) of the latent linear dynamical
system (LDS) model described by equations (1) and (2) from experimental data. One can learn these
parameters using the standard expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that ﬁnds a local maximum
of the log-likelihood of the observed data [19]. The E-step can be performed via Kalman Smoothing
(with a different C k for each session). In the M-step  the updates for A  B and Q are as in standard
linear dynamical systems  and the updates for R and d are element-wise given by

2.2 Details of simulated and experimental data

Simulated data. We simulated a population of 60 neurons which were split into 3 pools (’cell
types’) of 20 neurons each  with both connection probability and strength being cell-type speciﬁc.
Within each pool  pairs were coupled with probability 50% and random weights  cell-types one and
two had excitatory connections onto the other cells  and type three had weak but dense inhibitory
couplings (see Figure 2a  top left). Coupling weights were truncated at ±0.2. The 4-dimensional ex-
ternal stimulus was delivered into the ﬁrst pool. On average  24% of the variance of each neuron was
noise  2% driven by the stimulus  25% by self-couplings and a further 49% by network-interactions.
After shufﬂing the ordering of neurons (resulting in the connectivity matrix displayed in Fig. 2a 
top middle)  we simulated K = 10 trials of length T = 1000 samples from the population. We
then pretended that the population was imaged in two sessions with non-overlapping subsets of 30
neurons each (Figure 2a  green outlined blocks) of K = 5 trials each  and that observation noise 
was uncorrelated and very small  std(ii) = 0.006.
Experimental data. We also applied the stitching method to two calcium imaging datasets recorded
in the somatosensory cortex of awake or anesthetized mice. We imaged calcium signals in the
superﬁcial layers of mouse barrel cortex (S1) in-vivo using 2-photon laser scanning microscopy [1].
A genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP6s) was virally expressed  driven pan-neuronally
by the human-synapsin promoter  in the C2 whisker barrel and the activity of about 100-200 neurons
was imaged simultaneously in-vivo at about 3Hz  compatible with the slow timescales of the calcium
dynamics revealed by GCaMP6s. The anesthetized dataset was collected during an experiment in
which the C2 whisker of an anesthetized mouse was repeatedly ﬂicked randomly in one of three
different directions (rostrally  caudally or ventrally). About 200 neurons were imaged for about
27min at a depth of 240µm in the C2 whisker barrel. The awake dataset was collected while an
awake animal was performing a whisker ﬂick detection task. In this session  about 80 neurons were
imaged for about 55min at a depth of 190µm  also in the C2 whisker barrel. Regions of interest
(ROI) corresponding to putative GCaMP expressing soma (and in some instances isolated neuropil)
were manually deﬁned and the time-series corresponding to the calcium signal for each such ROI
was extracted. The calcium time-series were high-pass ﬁltered with a time-constant of 1s.

2.3 Quantifying and comparing model performance

Fictional imaging scenario in experimental data. To evaluate how well stitching works on real
data  we created a ﬁctional imaging scenario. We pretended that the neurons  which were in reality
simultaneously imaged  were not imaged in one session but instead were ‘imaged’ in two subsets in
two different sessions. The subsets corresponding to different ‘sessions’ c = 60% of the neurons 
meaning that the subsets overlapped and a few neurons in common. We also experimented with
c = 50% as in our simulation above  but failed to get good performance without any overlapping
neurons. We imagined that we spent the ﬁrst 40% of the time ‘imaging’ subset 1 and the second 40%
of the time ‘imaging’ subset 2. The ﬁnal 20% of the data was withheld for use as the test set. We
then used our stitching method to predict pairwise correlations from the ﬁctional imaging session.
Upper and lower bounds on performance. We wanted to benchmark how well our method is doing
both compared to the theoretical optimum and to a conventional approach. On synthetic data  we
can use the ground-truth parameters as the optimal model. In lieu of ground-truth on the real data 
we ﬁt a ‘fully observed’ model to the simulatenous imaging data of all neurons (which would be
impossible of course in practice  but is possible in our ﬁctional imaging scenario). We also analyzed
the data using a conventional  ‘naive’ approach in which we separately ﬁt dynamical system models
to each of the two imaging sessions and then combined their parameters. We set coefﬁcients of non-
simultaneously recorded pairs to 0 and averaged coefﬁcients for neurons which were part of both
imaging sessions (in the c = 60% scenario). The “fully observed” and the “naive” models constitute
an upper and lower bound respectively on our performance. Certainly we can not expect to do better
at predicting correlations  than if we had observed all neurons simultaneously.

3 Results

We tested our ability to stitch multiple observations into one coherent model which is capable of
predicting statistics of the joint dynamics  such as correlations across non-simultaneously imaged

method. b) Noise correlations estimated by our stitching method match true noise correlations

neuron pairs. We ﬁrst apply our method to a synthetic dataset to explain its properties  and then
demonstrate that it works for real calcium imaging measurements from the mouse somatosensory
cortex.

3.1 Inferring correlations and model parameters in a simulated population

It might seem counterintuitive that one can infer the cross-couplings  and hence noise-correlations 
between neurons observed in separate sessions. An intuition for why this might work nevertheless
can gained by considering the artiﬁcial scenario of a network of linearly interacting neurons driven
by Gaussian noise: Suppose that during the ﬁrst recording session we image half of these neurons.
We can ﬁt a linear state-space model to the data in which the other  unobserved half of the population
constitutes the latent space. Given enough data  the maximum likelihood estimate of the model
parameters (which is consistent) lets us identify the true joint dynamics of the whole population up
to an invertible linear transformation of the unobserved dimensions [21]. After the second imaging
session  where we image the second (and previously unobserved) half of the population  we can
identify this linear transformation  and thus identify all model parameters uniquely  in particular the
cross-couplings. To demonstrate this intuition  we simulated such an artiﬁcial dataset (described in
2.2) and describe here the results of the stitching procedure.
Recovering the coupling matrix. Our stitching method was able to recover the true coupling
matrix  including the off-diagonal blocks which correspond to pairs of neurons that were not imaged
simultaneously (see red-outlined blocks in 2a  bottom middle). As expected  recovery was better for
couplings across observed pairs (correlation between true and estimated parameters 0.95  excluding
self-couplings) than for non-simultaneously recorded pairs (Figure 2c; correlation 0.73). With the
“naive” approach couplings between non-simultaneously observed pairs cannot be recovered  and
even for simultaneously observed pairs  the estimate of couplings is biased (correlation 0.75).
Recovering noise correlations. We also quantiﬁed the degree to which we are able to predict
statistics of the joint dynamics of the whole network  in particular noise correlations across pairs
of neurons that were never observed simultaneously. We calculated noise correlations by comput-
ing correlations in variability of neural activity after subtracting contributions due to the stimulus.
We found that the stitching method was able to accurately recover the noise-correlations of non-
simultaneously recorded pairs (correlation between predicted and true correlations was 0.92; Figure
2b). In fact  we generally found the prediction of correlations to be more accurate than prediction

of the underlying coupling parameters. In contrast  a naive approach would not be able to estimate
noise correlations between non-simultaneously observed pairs. (We note that  as the stimulus drive
in this simulation was very weak  inferring noise correlations from stimulus correlations [12] would
be impossible).
Predicting unobserved neural activity. Given activity measurements from a subset of neurons 
our method can predict the activity of neurons in the unobserved subset. This prediction can be
calculated by doing inference in the resulting LDS  i.e. by calculating the posterior mean µk
1:T =
1:T which correspond to unobserved neurons.

On our simulated data  we found that this prediction was strongly correlated with the underlying
ground-truth activity (average correlation 0.70 ± 0.01 s.e.m across neurons  using a separate test-
set which was not used for parameter ﬁtting.). The upper bound for this prediction metric can be
obtained by using the ground-truth parameters to calculate the posterior mean. Use of this ground-
truth model resulted in a performance of 0.82 ± 0.01. In contrast  the ’naive’ approach can only
utilize the stimulus  but not the activity of the observed population for prediction and therefore only
achieved a correlation of 0.23 ± 0.01.

Inferring correlations in mouse somatosensory cortex

Next  we applied our stitching method to two real datasets: anesthetized and awake (described in
Section 2.2). We demonstrate that it can predict correlations between non-simultaneously accessed
neuron pairs with accuracy approaching that of the upper bound (“fully observed” model trained on
all neurons)  and substantially better than the lower bound “naive” model.
Example results. Figure 3a displays coupling matrices of a population consisting of the 50 most
correlated neurons in the anesthetized dataset (see Section 2.2 for details) estimated using all three
methods. Our stitching method yielded a coupling matrix with structure similar to the fully ob-
served model (Figure 3a  central panel)  even in the off-diagonal blocks which correspond to non-
simultaneously recorded pairs. In contrast  the naive method  by deﬁnition  is unable to infer cou-
plings for non-simultaneously recorded pairs  and therefore over-estimates the magnitude of ob-
served couplings (Figure 3a  right panel). Even for non-simultaneously recorded pairs  the stitched
model predicted couplings which were correlated with the fully observed predictions (Figure 3b 
correlation 0.38).

mouse (bottom row). Random populations of these neurons  ranging in size from 10 to 100 were
chosen and split into two slightly overlapping sub-sets each containing 60% of the neurons. The
activity of these sub-sets were imagined to be “imaged” in two separate “imaging” sessions (see
Section 2.2). a) Pairwise correlations for “non-simultaneously imaged” neuron pairs estimated by

terms are unavailable here.

However  of greater interest is how well our model can recover pairwise correlations between non-
simultaneously measured neuron pairs. We found that our stitching method  but not the naive
method  was able to accurately reconstruct these correlations (Figure 3c). As expected  the naive
method strongly under-estimated correlations in the non-simultaneously recorded blocks  as it can
only model stimulus-correlations but not noise-correlations across neurons. 1 In contrast  our stitch-
ing method predicted correlations well  matching those of the fully observed model (correlation 0.84
for stitchLDS  0.15 for naiveLDS  ﬁgure 3d).
Summary results across multiple populations. Here  we investigate the robustness of our ﬁnd-
ings. We drew random neuronal populations of sizes ranging from 10 to 80 (for awake) or 100
(for anesthetized) from the full datasets. For each population  we ﬁt three models (fully observed 
stitch  naive) and compared their correlations  parameters and activity cross-prediction accuracy.
We repeated this process 20 times for each population size and dataset (anesthetized/awake) to char-
acterize the variability. We found that for both datasets  the correlations predicted by the stitching
method for non-simultaneously recorded pairs were similar to the fully observed ones  and that this
similarity is almost independent of population size (Figure 4a). In fact  for the awake data (in which
the overall level of correlation was higher)  the correlation matrices were extremely similar (lower
panel). The stitching method also substantially outperformed the naive approach  for which the
similarity was lower by a factor of about 2.
We compared the accuracy of the models at predicting the neural activity of one subset of neu-
rons given the stimulus and the activity of the other subset (Figure 4b). We ﬁnd that our model
makes signiﬁcantly better predictions than the lower bound naive model  whose performance comes
from modeling the stimulus and neurons in the overlap between both subsets. Indeed for the more
active and correlated awake dataset  predictions are nearly as good as those of the fully observed

1The naive approach also over-estimated correlations within each view. This is a consequence of biases
resulting from averaging couplings across views for neurons in the overlap between the two ﬁctional sessions.

We also found that prediction accuracy increased slightly with population size  perhaps
since a larger population provides more neurons from which the activity of the other subset can be
predicted. Apparently  this gain in accuracy from additional neurons outweighed any potential drop
in performance resulting from increased potential for over-ﬁtting on larger populations.
While we have no access to the true cross-couplings for the real data  we can nonetheless compare
the couplings from our stitched model to those estimated by the fully observed model. We ﬁnd
that the stitching model is indeed able to estimate couplings that correlate positively with the fully
observed couplings  even for non-simultaneously imaged neuron pairs. Interestingly  this correlation
drops with increasing population size  perhaps due to possible near degeneracy of parameters for
large systems.

4 Discussion

It has long been appreciated that a dynamical system can be reconstructed from observations of only
a subset of its variables [22  23  21]. These theoretical results suggest that while only measuring
the activity of one population of neurons  we can infer the activity of a second neural population
that strongly interacts with the ﬁrst  up to re-parametrization. Here  we go one step further. By later
measuring the activity of the second population  we recover the true parametrization allowing us to
predict aspects of the joint dynamics of the two populations  such as noise correlations.
Our essential ﬁnding is that we can put these theoretical insights to work using a simple linear
dynamical system model that “stitches” together data from non-simultaneously recorded but strongly
interacting populations of neurons. We applied our method to analyze 2-photon population calcium
imaging measurements from the superﬁcial layers of the somatosensory cortex of both anesthetized
and awake mice  and found that our method was able to successfully combine data not accessed
simultaneously. In particular  this approach allowed us to accurately predict correlations even for
pairs of non-simultaneously recorded neurons.
In this paper  we focused our demonstration to stitching together two populations of neurons. Our
framework can be generalized to more than two populations  however it remains to be empirically
seen how well larger numbers of populations can be combined. An experimental variable of interest
is the degree of overlap (shared neurons) between different populations of neurons. We found that
some overlap was critical for stitching to work  and increasing overlap improves stitching perfor-
mance. Given a ﬁxed imaging time budget  determining a good trade-off between overlap and total
coverage is an intriguing open problem in experimental design.
We emphasise that our linear gaussian dynamical system provides only a statistical description of the
observed data. However  even this simple model makes accurate predictions of correlations between
non-simultaneously observed neurons. Nevertheless  more realistic models [16  6] can help improve
the accuracy of these predictions and disentangle the contributions of spiking activity  calcium dy-
namics  ﬂuorescence measurements and imaging noise to the observed statistics. Similarly  better
priors on neural connectivity [24] might improve reconstruction performance. Indeed  we found
in unreported simulations that using a sparsifying penalty on the connectivity matrix [6] improves
parameter estimates slightly. We note that our model can easily be extended to model potential
common input from neurons which are never observed [13] as a low dimensional LDS [17  18].
The simultaneous measurement of the activity of all neurons in a neural circuit will shed much light
on the nature of neural computation. While there is much progress in developing faster imaging
modalities  there are fundamental physical limits to the number of neurons which can be simulta-
neously imaged. Our paper suggests a means for expanding our limited capabilities. With more
powerful algorithmic tools  we can imagine mapping population dynamics of all the neurons in an
entire neural circuit such as the zebraﬁsh larval olfactory bulb  or layers 2 & 3 of a whisker barrel—
an ambitious goal which has until now been out of reach.
