Abstract

We address the challenge of assessing conservation of gene expression in com-
plex  non-homogeneous datasets. Recent studies have demonstrated the success
of probabilistic models in studying the evolution of gene expression in simple
eukaryotic organisms such as yeast  for which measurements are typically scalar
and independent. Models capable of studying expression evolution in much more
complex organisms such as vertebrates are particularly important given the medi-
cal and scientiﬁc interest in species such as human and mouse. We present Brow-
nian Factor Phylogenetic Analysis  a statistical model that makes a number of
signiﬁcant extensions to previous models to enable characterization of changes
in expression among highly complex organisms. We demonstrate the efﬁcacy of
our method on a microarray dataset proﬁling diverse tissues from multiple verte-
brate species. We anticipate that the model will be invaluable in the study of gene
expression patterns in other diverse organisms as well  such as worms and insects.

1 Introduction

High-throughput functional data is emerging as an indispensible resource for generating a complete
picture of genome-wide gene and protein function. Currently  gene function is often inferred through
sequence comparisons with genes of known function in other species  though sequence similarity
is no guarantee of shared biological function. Gene duplication  one of the primary forces of ge-
nomic evolution  often gives rise to genes with high sequence similarity but distinct biological roles
[1]. Differences in temporal and spatial gene expression patterns have also been posited to explain
phenotypic differences among animals despite a surprisingly large degree of gene sequence simi-
larity [2]. This observation and the increasingly wide availability of genome-wide gene expression
proﬁles from related organisms has motivated us to develop statistical models to study the evolu-
tion of gene expression along phylogenies  in order to identify lineages where gene expression and
therefore gene function is likely to be conserved or diverged.

Comparing gene expression patterns between distantly related multi-cellular organisms is challeng-
ing because it is difﬁcult to collect a wide range of functionally matching tissue samples. In some
cases  matching samples simply may not exist because some organismal functions have been redis-
tributed among otherwise homologous organs. For example  processes such as B-cell development
are performed by both distinct and overlapping sets of tissues: primarily bone marrow in mammals;
Bursa of Fabricus and bone marrow in birds; and likely kidney  spleen  and/or thymus in teleost ﬁsh
(who lack bone marrow) [3]. Matching samples can also be hard to collect because anatomical ar-
rangements of some of the queried organisms make isolation of speciﬁc tissues virtually impossible.
For example  in frog  the kidneys are immediately adjacent to the ovaries and are typically covered in
oocytes. By allowing tissue samples to be mixed and heterogeneous  though functionally related  it

1

becomes possible to compare expression patterns describing a much larger range of functions across
a much larger range of organisms.

Current detailed statistical models of expression data assume measurements from matched samples
in each organism. As such  comparative studies of gene expression to date have either resorted to
simple  non-phylogenetic measures to compare expression patterns [4]  or restricted their compar-
isons to single-cellular organisms [5] or clearly homologous tissues in mammals [6].

Here  we present Brownian Factor Phylogenetic Analysis (BFPA)  a new model of gene expres-
sion evolution that removes the earlier limitations of matched samples  therefore allowing detailed
comparisons of expression patterns from the widely diverged multi-cellular organisms. Our model
takes as input expression proﬁles of orthologous genes in multiple present-day organisms and a phy-
logenetic tree connecting those organisms  and simultaneously reconstructs the expression proﬁles
for the ancestral nodes in the phylogenetic tree while detecting links in the phylogeny where rapid
change of the expression proﬁle has occurred.

We model the expression data from related organisms using a mixture of Gaussians model related
to a mixture of constrained factor analyzers [7]. In our model  each mixture component represents a
different pattern of conservation and divergence of gene expression along each link of the phyloge-
netic tree. We assume a constrained linear mapping between the heterogeneous samples in different
organisms and ﬁt this mapping using maximum likelihood. We show that by expanding the amount
of expression data that can be compared between species  our model generates more useful infor-
mation for predicting gene function and is also better able to reconstruct the evolutionary history of
gene expression as evidenced by its increased accuracy in reconstructing gene expression levels.

2 Previous work

Recent evolutionary models of gene expression treat it as a quantitative (i.e. real-valued) trait and
model evolutionary change in expression levels as a Brownian motion process [8  9]. Assuming
Brownian motion  a given gene’s expression level xs in a child species s after a divergence time ts
from an ancestral species π(s) is predicted to be Gaussian distributed with a mean xπ(s) equal to the
gene’s expression level in the ancestor and variance σ2ts:

xs ∼ N(xπ(s)  σ2ts)

(1)

where σ2 represents the expected rate of change per unit time. The ancestor-child relationships are
speciﬁed using a phylogeny  such as that shown in Figure 1a for the vertebrates. The leaves of the
phylogeny are associated with present-day species and the internal branch points with shared ances-
tors. The exact position of the root of the phylogeny (not shown in the ﬁgure  but somewhere along
branch ”T”) cannot be established without additional information  and the outgroup species ”T” is
often used in place of the root of the tree. Nonetheless  the rooted phylogeny can be interpreted as a
directed Gaussian graphical model  e.g. Figure 1b  whose nodes are variables representing expres-
sion levels in the corresponding species and whose directed edges point from immediate ancestors
to their children species. The conditional probability distribution (CPD) at each node is given by
Equation 1.

Typical uses of these evolutionary models are to compare different hypotheses about divergence
times [8] or the structure of the phylogeny [9] by calculating the likelihood of the present-day ex-
pression levels under various hypotheses. To avoid assigning this prior over the root node and
thus introducing bias [10]  Felsenstein developed a method called restricted maximum likelihood
(REML) [11]  which speciﬁes a distribution over the observed differences between present-day ex-
pression levels rather than the expression levels themselves.

3 Brownian Factor Phylogenetic Analysis: A model of expression evolution

In the following section  we propose changes to the Brownian motion model that not only allow
for unmatched tissue samples  but also leverage the change observed in expression levels across
multiple genes in order to classify genes into different patterns of expression evolution. We use xi
s
to indicate the hidden expression proﬁle of the i-th gene (out of N ortholog groups) in species s.

Modeling branch lengths. Equation 2 reﬂects the central assumption of Brownian motion models [8 
9  10] described in Equation 1  extended in two ways. BFPA extends this concept in two directions.
First  we constrain all variances Σs to be diagonal in order to estimate tissue-speciﬁc drift rates 
as tissues are known to vary widely in expression divergence rates [12]. Secondly  we note that in
studying a diverse lineage such as vertebrates  we expect to see large changes in expression for genes
that have diverged in function  as compared to genes of conserved function. We therefore model the
drift of a gene’s expression levels along each branch of the tree as following one of two rates: a
slow rate  reﬂecting a functional constraint  and a fast rate  reﬂecting neutral or selected change.
Correspondingly  for each branch of the phylogenetic tree above the species s  we deﬁne two rate

parameters  ρ2
s or ρ1
and initialize ρ1
s to a much larger value to maintain this relationship during learning  thus modeling
fast-moving genes as outliers. Our method of modelling constrained and unconstrained change as
scalar multiples of a common variance is similar to the discrete gamma method [13].

We model tissues of child species as linear
combinations of ancestral tissues. The matrix of coefﬁcients Λs that relate expression levels in
the child species’ tissues to that of its parent species is heavily constrained to leverage our prior
understanding of the relationships of speciﬁc tissues [14]. To construct Λs  pairs of tissues that were
the heart) had their corresponding entry in Λs ﬁxed at 1  and all other
clearly homologous (i.e.
entries in the same row set to zero. For the remaining tissues  literature searches were conducted
to determine which groups of tissues had broadly related function (i.e. immune tissues)  and those
entries were allowed to vary from zero. All other entries were constrained to be zero.

Distinguishing intra- and inter-species variation. Equation 3 relates the observed expression levels
of present-day species to the noiseless  inferred expression levels of the corresponding hidden nodes
of each observed species. The variance factor βs is an estimate of the variation expected due to
noise in the array measurements  and are estimated via maximum likelihood using multiple identical
probes present on each microarray.

Conservation pattern estimation. Our goal is to identify different types of expression evolution 
including punctuated evolution  fully conserved expression  or rapid change along all branches of
the phylogeny. We model the problem as a mixture model of conservation patterns  in which each
conservation pattern speciﬁes either constrained or fast change along each branch of the tree. Each
conservation pattern Kj ∈ {1  2}|P∪A| speciﬁes a conﬁguration of ρ1
s for each species s
(Kj s ∈ {1  2} speciﬁes ρKj s
). However  not all 2|P∪A| possible patterns of short and long branches
can be uniquely considered. In particular  a tree containing at least one ancestor incident to two long
branches and one short are ambiguous because this tree cannot be distinguished from the same tree
with that ancestor incident to three long branches. As a post-processing step  we consider short
branches in those cases to be long  and sum over such ambiguous trees  leaving a total of J possible
conservation patterns. Each pattern Kj is assigned a prior probability P (Kj) = γj that is learned 
as reﬂected in Equation 4.

Although we have rooted the phylogeny using a present-day species rather than place a hypothetical
root as has been done in previous Brownian motion models  these two models are related because
they are equivalent under the condition that all samples are matched. First  note that in traditional
Brownian motion models  the location of the root is arbitrary if one assumes a constant  improper
prior over the root expression levels  since any choice of root would give rise to the same probability
distribution over the expression levels. By using a present-day species with observed expression
levels as the root node  we avoid integrating over this improper prior. Because the root node prior
is constant  the likelihood of the other present-day species conditioned on this present-day root
expression level is a constant times the likelihood of all present-day species expression levels. Our
conditional model therefore assigns identical likelihoods and marginals as REML.

6 Results

We present the results of applying our model to a novel dataset consisting of gene expression mea-
surements of 4770 genes with unique  unambiguous orthology  i.e.  each of the 4770 genes is present
in only a single copy  across the following ﬁve present-day organisms: human  mouse  chicken  frog 
and tetraodon. The phylogeny related these species is shown in Figure 1 with nodes labelled by the
ﬁrst letter of the species name. We set Tetradon as the root  so o = T and P = {H  M  C  F}
and we label the internal ancestors by concatenating the labels of their present-day descendants  so
A = {HM  HM C  HM CF}.
Replicate microarray probe intensity measurements were taken for the 4770 genes across a total of
161 tissues (i.e.  322 microarrays in total) in the ﬁve organisms: 46 tissues from human  55 from
mouse  and 20 from each of the other three organisms. We applied a standard pre-processing pipeline
to the array set to remove experimental artifacts and to transform the probe intensity measurements
on each array to a common  variance-stabilized scale. Each array was ﬁrst spatially detrended as
described in [15]. Within a species  all arrays share the same probe set  so we applied VSN [16]
to the arrays from each species to estimate an array-speciﬁc afﬁne transform to transform the probe
intensities to species-speciﬁc units. We next applied an arcsinh transform to the probe intensities
to make the variance of the noise independent of the intensity measurement. For the ﬁnal two pre-
processing steps  we placed the transformed intensity measurements into a matrix for each species.
The rows of this matrix correspond to genes and the columns are the measured tissues. First  to re-
move probe bias in the transformed intensities  we subtracted the row median from each element and
then to attempt to transform measurements from different species to a common scale  we subtracted
the column means from each element and divided by the column length.

First  we investigate the stability of our conservation pattern estimates by using parameters trained on
different random subsamples of our genes. We then evaluate the predictive value of our algorithm
BFPA using two tasks: a) predicting gene expression proﬁles in a new species given expression
proﬁles in other species  and b) predicting Gene Ontology annotation using the conservation pattern
inferred by our model.

To perform the stability experiments  we ﬁrst randomly split the dataset into ﬁve subsets  and used
each subset individually to train the model using 100 iterations of EM. We then estimated P (ci|ˆxi
s  θ)
for the four other subsets of genes  and classiﬁed each gene into its most likely conservation pattern.
Hence  each gene is classiﬁed four times by non-overlapping training sets. Figure 2 shows that
the classiﬁcations are quite stable and that most genes are classiﬁed into few conservation patterns.
Most genes that were uniquely classiﬁed into a single conservation pattern either were classiﬁed as
fully (all) conserved or completely unconserved  resulting in relatively few high-conﬁdence lineage-
speciﬁc genes.

6.1 Functional associations of co-transcriptionally evolving genes

Pairs of genes exhibiting correlated expression also tend to perform similar function. This guilt-
by-association principle is often used to initially assign putative functions to genes. For example 
a popular method for analyzing gene expression datasets is to cluster genes based on the pairwise

5

Figure 2: Stability of conservation pattern assignments to genes. (left) Each gene was placed into
one of four bins  denoting the number of unique patterns it was classiﬁed into. Most genes were
consistently classiﬁed into one conservation pattern for all four of its independent classiﬁcations.
(right) For all genes uniquely classiﬁed into a single conservation pattern  the number of present-
day species adjacent to conserved links was computed. Most genes were either classiﬁed as fully
(all) conserved or completely unconserved.

Pearson correlation coefﬁcient (PCC)  then measure the enrichment of these clusters in Gene On-
tology (GO) function and process annotations [17]. In this section  we introduce the evolutionary
correlation coefﬁcient (ECC)  a simple modiﬁcation of PCC to integrate model predictions  and ex-
amine whether genes with the same annotated function are more similar in rank according the ECC
or PCC measures. ECC scales the positively-transformed PCC by the marginal probability of the
genes following the same expression evolution  assuming independent evolution.

ECC(ˆxi  ˆxk) = (cid:0)1 + P CC(ˆxi  ˆxk)(cid:1)X

j

P (ci = j|ˆxi  θ)P (ck = j|ˆxk  θ)

ECC can be applied using the output of either BFPA or the Brownian model. For the Brownian
model  we trained and made predictions using only those matched samples in all ﬁve species. Those
ten samples are the central nervous system (CNS)  intestine  heart  kidney  liver  eye  muscle  spleen 
stomach  and testis. We also introduce ECC-sequence  designed to measure the value of evolutionary
information derived from sequence. First  the protein sequences of each gene were aligned using
default parameters of MUSCLE [18]. These alignments were then inputted into PAML [19] together
with the species tree shown in Figure 1 to estimate branch lengths. The PCC measure for each pair
of genes was then scaled by the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient of the branch lengths estimated by
PAML to produce ECC-sequence.

For all models  we ﬁrst used the ECC/PCC similarity metric for each gene to rank all other genes
in order of expression similarity. We then apply the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test to evaluate whether
genes with the same GO annotations  as annotated for the mouse ortholog  are signiﬁcantly higher in
rank than all other genes. For this analysis  we only considered GO Process categories which have
at least one of the 4770 genes annotated in that category. We also removed all genes which were not
annotated in any category  resulting in a total of 3319 genes and 4246 categories.

Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of smallest p-values achieved by each gene over all of their anno-
tated functions. PCC is used as a baseline performance measure as it does not consider evolutionary
information. We see that all evolutionary-based models outperform PCC in ranking genes with sim-
ilar function much closer on average. ECC-sequence performs worse than PCC  suggesting that
expression-based evolutionary metrics may provide additional information compared to those based
on sequence. The relative performance of BFPA versus Brownian reﬂects an overall signiﬁcant per-
formance gap between our models and the existing ones. A control measure ECC-random is shown 
which is computed by randomizing the gene labels of the data in each of the ﬁve organisms before
learning. Finally  Brown+prior measures the performance of the Brownian model when the conser-
vation pattern priors are allowed to be estimated  and performs better than the Brownian model but
worse than BFPA  as expected. All differences between the distributions are statistically signiﬁcant 
as all pairwise p-values computed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test are less than 10−6.

6.2 Reconstruction of gene expression levels

Here we report the performance of our model in predicting the expression level of a gene in each
of human  mouse  chicken  and frog  given its expression levels in the other species. Tetraodon is
not predicted because it acts as an outgroup in our model. The model was trained using 100 EM
iterations on half of the dataset  which was then used to predict the expression levels for each gene
in each species in the other half of the dataset  and vice versa. To create a baseline performance
measure  we computed the error when using an average of the four other species to predict the
expression level of a gene in the ﬁfth species. We only compute predictions for the ten matched
samples across all species so that we can compare errors made by our model against those of Brow-
nian and the baseline  which require matched samples. Figure 3 shows that with the exception of
the comparison against Brownian in chicken  BFPA achieves lower error than both Brownian and
baseline in predicting expression measurements.

7 Discussion

We have presented a new model for the simultaneous evolution of gene expression levels across mul-
tiple tissues and organs. Given expression data from present-day species  our model can be used to
simultaneously infer the ancestral expression levels of orthologous genes as well as determine where
in the phylogeny the gene expression levels underwent substantial change. BFPA extends previous
Brownian models [8  9] by introducing a constrained factor analysis framework to account for com-
plex tissue relationships between different species and by adapting the discrete gamma method [13]
to model quantitative gene expression data. Our model performs better than other Brownian models
in functional association and expression prediction experiments  demonstrating that the evolution-
ary history we infer better recovers the function of the gene. We have shown that this is in large
part due to our ability to consider species-speciﬁc tissue measurements  a feature not implemented
in any existing model to the best of our knowledge. We also showed that gene expression-based
phylogenetic data may provide information not contained in sequence-based phylogenetic data in
terms of helping predict the functional association of genes.

Our model has a number of other applications outside of using it to study the evolutionary history of
gene expression. Our ability to identify genes with conserved expression across multiple species will
help in the inference of gene function from annotated to non-annotated species because unconserved
expression patterns indicate a likely change in the biological function of a gene. We also expect
that by identifying species that share a conserved expression pattern  our model will aid in the

those species identiﬁed as conserved in expression.

While we have taken different proﬁled samples as representing different tissues  our methodology
can be easily expanded to study evolutionary change in gene expression in response to different
growth conditions or environmental stresses  as with those studied in [5]. Our methodology is
also easily extendible to other model organisms for which there are genomes and expression data
for multiple closely related species (e.g. yeast  worm  ﬂy  plants). We anticipate that the results
obtained will be invaluable in the study of genome evolution and identiﬁcation of cis-regulatory
elements  whose phylogeny should reﬂect that of the gene expression patterns.
