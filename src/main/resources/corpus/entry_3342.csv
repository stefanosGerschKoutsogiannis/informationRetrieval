Abstract

A market scoring rule (MSR) – a popular tool for designing algorithmic prediction
markets – is an incentive-compatible mechanism for the aggregation of probabilis-
tic beliefs from myopic risk-neutral agents. In this paper  we add to a growing
body of research aimed at understanding the precise manner in which the price
process induced by a MSR incorporates private information from agents who de-
viate from the assumption of risk-neutrality. We ﬁrst establish that  for a myopic
trading agent with a risk-averse utility function  a MSR satisfying mild regular-
ity conditions elicits the agent’s risk-neutral probability conditional on the latest
market state rather than her true subjective probability. Hence  we show that a
MSR under these conditions effectively behaves like a more traditional method of
belief aggregation  namely an opinion pool  for agents’ true probabilities. In par-
ticular  the logarithmic market scoring rule acts as a logarithmic pool for constant
absolute risk aversion utility agents  and as a linear pool for an atypical budget-
constrained agent utility with decreasing absolute risk aversion. We also point out
the interpretation of a market maker under these conditions as a Bayesian learner
even when agent beliefs are static.

Introduction

How should we combine opinions (or beliefs) about hidden truths (or uncertain future events) fur-
nished by several individuals with potentially diverse information sets into a single group judgment
for decision or policy-making purposes? This has been a fundamental question across disciplines
for a long time (Surowiecki [2005]). One simple  principled approach towards achieving this end is
the opinion pool (OP) which directly solicits inputs from informants in the form of probabilities (or
distributions) and then maps this vector of inputs to a single probability (or distribution) based on
certain axioms (Genest and Zidek [1986]). However  this technique abstracts away from the issue
of providing proper incentives to a selﬁsh-rational agent to reveal her private information honestly.
Financial markets approach the problem differently  offering ﬁnancial incentives for traders to sup-
ply their information about valuations and aggregating this information into informative prices. A
prediction market is a relatively novel tool that builds upon this idea  offering trade in a ﬁnancial se-
curity whose ﬁnal monetary worth is tied to the future revelation of some currently unknown ground
truth. Hanson [2003] introduced a family of algorithms for designing automated prediction markets
called the market scoring rule (MSR) of which the Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LMSR) is
arguably the most widely used and well-studied. A MSR effectively acts as a cost function-based
market maker always willing to take the other side of a trade with any willing buyer or seller  and
re-adjusting its quoted price after every transaction.
One of the most attractive properties of a MSR is its incentive-compatibility for a myopic risk-neutral
trader. But this also means that  every time a MSR trades with such an agent  the updated market

1

price is reset to the subjective probability of that agent; the market mechanism itself does not play an
active role in unifying pieces of information gleaned from the entire trading history into its current
price. Ostrovsky [2012] and Iyer et al. [2014] have shown that  with differentially informed Bayesian
risk-neutral and risk-averse agents respectively  trading repeatedly  “information gets aggregated” in
a MSR-based market in a perfect Bayesian equilibrium. However  if agent beliefs themselves do not
converge  can the price process emerging out of their interaction with a MSR still be viewed as an
aggeragator of information in some sense? Intuitively  even if an agent does not revise her belief
based on her inference about her peers’ information from market history  her conservative attitude
towards risk should compel her to trade in such a way as to move the market price not all the way
to her private belief but to some function of her belief and the most recent price; thus  the evolving
price should always retain some memory of all agents’ information sequentially injected into the
market. Therefore  the assumption of belief-updating agents may not be indispensable for providing
theoretical guarantees on how the market incorporates agent beliefs. A few attempts in this vein
can be found in the literature  typically embedded in a broader context (Sethi and Vaughan [2015] 
Abernethy et al. [2014])  but there have been few general results; see Section 1.1 for a review.
In this paper  we develop a new uniﬁed understanding of the information aggregation characteristics
of a market with risk-averse agents mediated by a MSR  with no regard to how the agents’ beliefs are
formed. In fact  we demonstrate an equivalence between such MSR-mediated markets and opinion
pools. We do so by ﬁrst proving  in Section 3  that for any MSR interacting with myopic risk-averse
traders  the revised instantaneous price after every trade equals the latest trader’s risk-neutral proba-
bility conditional on the preceding market state. We then show that this price update rule satisﬁes an
axiomatic characterization of opinion pooling functions from the literature  establishing the equiva-
lence. In Sections 3.1  and 3.2  we focus on a speciﬁc MSR  the commonly used logarithmic variety
(LMSR). We demonstrate that a LMSR-mediated market with agents having constant absolute risk
aversion (CARA) utilities is equivalent to a logarithmic opinion pool  and that a LMSR-mediated
market with budget-constrained agents having a speciﬁc concave utility with decreasing absolute
risk aversion is equivalent to a linear opinion pool. We also demonstrate how the agents’ utility
function parameters acquire additional signiﬁcance with respect to this pooling operation  and that
in these two scenarios the market maker can be interpreted as a Bayesian learning algorithm even
if agents never update beliefs. Our results are reminiscent of similar ﬁndings about competitive
equilibrium prices in markets with rational  risk-averse agents (Pennock [1999]  Beygelzimer et al.
[2012]  Millin et al. [2012] etc.)  but those models require that agents learn from prices and also
abstract away from any consideration of microstructure and the dynamics of actual price formation
(how the agents would reach the equilibrium is left open). By contrast  our results do not presuppose
any kind of generative model for agent signals  and also do not involve an equilibrium analysis –
hence they can be used as tools to analyze the convergence characteristics of the market price in
non-equilibrium situations with potentially ﬁxed-belief or irrational agents.

1.1 Related Work

Given the plethora of experimental and empirical evidence that prediction markets are at least as ef-
fective as more traditional means of belief aggregation (Wolfers and Zitzewitz [2004]  Cowgill and
Zitzewitz [2013])  there has been considerable work on understanding how such a market formu-
lates its own consensus belief from individual signals. An important line of research (Beygelzimer
et al. [2012]  Millin et al. [2012]  Hu and Storkey [2014]  Storkey et al. [2015]) has focused on a
competitive equilibrium analysis of prediction markets under various trader models  and found an
equivalence between the market’s equilibrium price and the outcome of an opinion pool with the
same agents. Seminal work in this ﬁeld was done by Pennock [1999] who showed that linear and
logarithmic opinion pools arise as special cases of the equilibrium of his intuitive model of securities
markets when all agents have generalized logarithmic and negative exponential utilities respectively.
Unlike these analyses that abstract away from the microstructure  Ostrovsky [2012] and Iyer et al.
[2014] show that certain market structures (including market scoring rules) satisfying mild condi-
tions perform “information aggregation” (i.e. the market’s belief measure converges in probability
to the ground truth) for repeatedly trading and learning agents with risk-neutral and risk-averse util-
ities respectively. Our contribution  while drawing inspiration from these sources  differs in that
we delve into the characteristics of the evolution of the price rather than the properties of prices
in equilibrium  and examine the manner in which the microstructure induces aggregation even if
the agents are not Bayesian. While there has also been signiﬁcant work on market properties in

2

continuous double auctions or markets mediated by sophisticated market-making algorithms (e.g.
Cliff and Bruten [1997]  Farmer et al. [2005]  Brahma et al. [2012] and references therein) when the
agents are “zero intelligence” or derivatives thereof (and therefore deﬁnitely not Bayesian)  this line
of literature has not looked at market scoring rules in detail  and analytical results have been rare.
In recent years  the literature focusing on the market scoring rule (or  equivalently  the cost function-
based market maker) family has grown substantially. Chen and Vaughan [2010] and Frongillo et al.
[2012] have uncovered isomorphisms between this type of market structure and well-known ma-
chine learning algorithms. We  on the other hand  are concerned with the similarities between price
evolution in MSR-mediated markets and opinion pooling methods (see e.g. Garg et al. [2004]). Our
work comes close to that of Sethi and Vaughan [2015] who show analytically that the price sequence
of a cost function-based market maker with budget-limited risk-averse traders is “convergent under
general conditions”  and by simulation that the limiting price of LMSR with multi-shot but myopic
logarithmic utility agents is approximately a linear opinion pool of agent beliefs. Abernethy et al.
[2014] show that a risk-averse exponential utility agent with an exponential family belief distribu-
tion updates the state vector of a generalization of LMSR that they propose to a convex combination
of the current market state vector and the natural parameter vector of the agent’s own belief distri-
bution (see their Theorem 5.2  Corollary 5.3) – this reduces to a logarithmic opinion pool (LogOP)
for classical LMSR. The LMSR-LogOP connection was also noted by Pennock and Xia [2011] (in
their Theorem 1) but with respect to an artiﬁcial probability distribution based on an agent’s ob-
served trade that the authors deﬁned instead of considering traders’ belief structure or strategies. We
show how results of this type arise as special cases of a more general MSR-OP equivalence that we
establish in this paper.

2 Model and deﬁnitions

Consider a decision-maker or principal interested in the “opinions” / ”beliefs” / “forecasts” of a
group of n agents about an extraneous random binary event X ∈ {0  1}  expressed in the form of
point probabilities πi ∈ (0  1)  i = 1  2  . . .   n  i.e. πi is agent i’s subjective probability Pr(X = 1).
X can represent a proposition such as “A Republican will win the next U.S. presidential election”
or “The favorite will beat the underdog by more than a pre-determined point spread in a game of
football” or “The next Avengers movie will hit a certain box ofﬁce target in its opening week.” In this
section  we brieﬂy describe two approaches towards the aggregation of such private beliefs: (1) the
opinion pool  which disregards the problem of incentivizing truthful reports  and focuses simply on
unifying multiple probabilistic reports on a topic  and (2) the market scoring rule  an incentive-based
mechanism for extracting honest beliefs from selﬁsh-rational agents.

2.1 Opinion Pool (OP)
This family of methods takes as input the vector of probabilistic reports pi  i = 1  2 ···   n submitted
by n agents  also called experts in this context  and computes an aggregate or consensus operator

(cid:98)p = f (p1  p2 ···   pn) ∈ [0  1]. Garg et al. [2004] identiﬁed three desiderata for an opinion pool

(other criteria are also recognized in the literature  but the following are the most basic and natural):

1. Unanimity: If all experts agree  the aggregate also agrees with them.
2. Boundedness: The aggregate is bounded by the extremes of the inputs.
3. Monotonicity:

If one expert changes her opinion in a particular direction while all other

experts’ opinions remain unaltered  then the aggregate changes in the same direction.

Deﬁnition 1. We call (cid:98)p = f (p1  p2 ···   pn) a valid opinion pool for n probabilistic reports if it

possesses properties 1  2  and 3 listed above.

It is easy to derive the following result for recursively deﬁned pooling functions that will prove
useful for establishing an equivalence between market scoring rules and opinion pools. The proof is
in Section 1 of the Supplementary Material.
Lemma 1. For a two-outcome scenario  if f2(r1  r2) and fn−1(q1  q2  . . .   qn−1) are valid opinion
pools for two probabilistic reports r1  r2 and n−1 probabilistic reports q1  q2  . . .   qn−1 respectively 
then f (p1  p2  . . .   pn) = f2(fn−1(p1  p2  . . .   pn−1)  pn) is also a valid opinion pool for n reports.

2.2 Market Scoring Rule (MSR)
In general  a scoring rule is a function of two variables s(p  x) ∈ R ∪ {−∞ ∞}  where p is an
agent’s probabilistic prediction (density or mass function) about an uncertain event  x is the realized
or revealed outcome of that event after the prediction has been made  and the resulting value of s
is the agent’s ex post compensation for prediction. For a binary event X  a scoring rule can just be
represented by the pair (s1(p)  s0(p)) which is the vector of agent compensations for {X = 1} and
{X = 0} respectively  p ∈ [0  1] being the agent’s reported probability of {X = 1} which may or
may not be equal to her true subjective probability  say  π = Pr(X = 1). A scoring rule is deﬁned
to be strictly proper if it is incentive-compatible for a risk-neutral agent  i.e. an agent maximizes
her subjective expectation of her ex post compensation by reporting her true subjective probability:
π = arg maxp∈[0 1] [πs1(p) + (1 − π)s0(p)]  ∀π ∈ [0  1].
In addition  a two-outcome scoring rule is regular if sj(·) is real-valued except possibly that s0(1)
or s1(0) is −∞; any regular strictly proper scoring rule can written in the following form (Gneiting
and Raftery [2007]):

j ∈ {0  1}  p ∈ [0  1] 

sj(p) = G(p) + G(cid:48)(p)(j − p) 

(1)
G : [0  1] → R is a strictly convex function with G(cid:48)(·) as a sub-gradient which is real-valued expect
possibly that −G(cid:48)(0) or G(cid:48)(1) is ∞; if G(·) is differentiable in (0  1)  G(cid:48)(·) is simply its derivative.
A classic example of a regular strictly proper scoring rule is the logarithmic scoring rule:

s0(p) = b ln(1 − p)  where b > 0 is a free parameter.

(2)
Hanson [2003] introduced an extension of a scoring rule wherein the principal initiates the process
of information elicitation by making a baseline report p0  and then elicits publicly declared reports
pi sequentially from n agents; the ex post compensation cx(pi  pi−1) received by agent i from the
principal  where x is the realized outcome of event X  is the difference between the scores assigned
to the reports made by herself and her predecessor:

s1(p) = b ln p;

x ∈ {0  1}.

cx(pi  pi−1) (cid:44) sx(pi) − sx(pi−1) 

(3)
If each agent acts non-collusively  risk-neutrally  and myopically (as if her current interaction with
the principal is her last)  then the incentive compatibility property of a strictly proper score still holds
for the sequential version. Moreover  it is easy to show that the principal’s worst-case payout (loss)
is bounded regardless of agent behavior. In particular  for the binary-outcome logarithmic score  the
loss bound for p0 = 1/2 is b ln 2; b can be referred to as the principal’s loss parameter.
A sequentially shared strictly proper scoring rule of the above form can also be interpreted as a
cost function-based prediction market mechanism offering trade in an Arrow-Debreu (i.e. (0  1)-
valued) security written on the event X  hence the name “market scoring rule”. The cost function
is a strictly convex function of the total outstanding quantity of the security that determines all
execution costs; its ﬁrst derivative (the cost per share of buying or the proceeds per share from
selling an inﬁnitesimal quantity of the security) is called the market’s “instantaneous price”  and can
be interpreted as the market maker’s current risk-neutral probability (Chen and Pennock [2007]) for
{X = 1}  the starting price being equal to the principal’s baseline report p0. Trading occurs in
discrete episodes 1  2  . . .   n  in each of which an agent orders a quantity of the security to buy or
sell given the market’s cost function and the (publicly displayed) instantaneous price. Since there is
a one-to-one correspondence between agent i’s order size and pi  the market’s revised instantaneous
price after trading with agent i  an agent’s “action” or trading decision in this setting is identical to
making a probability report by selecting a pi ∈ [0  1]. If agent i is risk-neutral  then pi is  by design 
her subjective probability πi (see Hanson [2003]  Chen and Pennock [2007] for further details).

4

Deﬁnition 2. We call a market scoring rule well-behaved if the underlying scoring rule is regular
and strictly proper  and the associated convex function G(·) (as in (1)) is continuous and thrice-
differentiable  with 0 < G(cid:48)(cid:48)(p) < ∞ and |G(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48)(p)| < ∞ for 0 < p < 1.

3 MSR behavior with risk-averse myopic agents

We ﬁrst present general results on the connection between sequential trading in a MSR-mediated
market with risk-averse agents and opinion pooling  and then give a more detailed picture for two
representative utility functions without and with budget constraints respectively. Please refer to
Section 2 of the Supplementary Material for detailed proofs of all results in this section.
Suppose that  in addition to a belief πi = Pr(X = 1)  each agent i has a continuous utility function
of wealth ui(c)  where c ∈ [cmin
 ∞] denotes her (ex post) wealth  i.e. her net compensation from
∈ [−∞  0] is her minimum
the market mechanism after the realization of X deﬁned in (3)  and cmin
acceptable wealth (a negative value suggests tolerance of debt); ui(·) satisﬁes the usual criteria of
i(c) > 0 except possibly that u(cid:48)
non-satiation i.e. u(cid:48)
i (c) < 0
i (∞) = 0  through out its domain (Mas-Colell et al. [1995]); in other words
except possibly that u(cid:48)(cid:48)
ui(·) is strictly increasing and strictly concave. Additionally  we require its ﬁrst two derivatives to
) = −∞. Note
be ﬁnite and continuous on [cmin
on the agent’s wealth  we can account for any starting
that  by choosing a ﬁnite lower bound cmin
wealth or budget constraint that effectively restricts the agent’s action space.
Lemma 2. If |cmin
| < ∞  then there exist lower and upper bounds  pmin
∈
[pi−1  1] respectively  on the feasible values of the price pi to which agent i can drive the market
regardless of her belief πi  where pmin
i + s0(pi−1)).

Since the latest price pi−1 can be viewed as the market’s current “state” from myopic agent i’s
perspective  the agent’s ﬁnal utility depends not only on her own action pi and the extraneously
determined outcome x but also on the current market state pi−1 she encounters  her rational action
being given by pi = arg maxp∈[0 1] [πiui(c1(p  pi−1)) + (1 − πi)ui(c0(pi  pi−1))]. This leads us
to the main result of this section.
Theorem 1. If a well-behaved market scoring rule for an Arrow-Debreu security with a starting
instantaneous price p0 ∈ (0  1) trades with a sequence of n myopic agents with subjective probabil-
ities π1  . . .   πn ∈ (0  1) and risk-averse utility functions of wealth u1(·)  . . .   un(·) as above  then
the updated market price pi after every trading episode i ∈ {1  2  . . .   n} is equivalent to a valid
opinion pool for the market’s initial baseline report p0 and the subjective probabilities π1  π2  . . .   πi
of all agents who have traded up to (and including) that episode.

Proof sketch.
For every trading epsiode i  by setting the ﬁrst derivative of agent i’s expected
utility to zero  and analyzing the resulting equation  we can arrive at the following lemmas.
Lemma 3. Under the conditions of Theorem 1  if pi−1 ∈ (0  1)  then the revised price pi after agent
i trades is the unique solution in (0  1) to the ﬁxed-point equation:

pi =

πiu(cid:48)

i(c1(pi  pi−1))
i(c1(pi  pi−1)) + (1 − πi)u(cid:48)

πiu(cid:48)

i(c0(pi  pi−1))

.

(4)

Since p0 ∈ (0  1)  and πi ∈ (0  1) ∀i  pi is also conﬁned to (0  1) ∀i  by induction.
Lemma 4. The implicit function pi(pi−1  πi) described by (4) has the following properties:

1. pi = πi (or pi−1) if and only if πi = pi−1.
2. 0 < min{pi−1  πi} < pi < max{pi−1  πi} < 1 whenever πi (cid:54)= pi−1  0 < πi  pi−1 < 1.
3. For any given pi−1 (resp. πi)  pi is a strictly increasing function of πi (resp. pi−1).

Evidently  properties 1  2  and 3 above correspond to axioms of unanimity  boundedness  and mono-
tonicity respectively  deﬁned in Section 2. Hence  pi(pi−1  πi) is a valid opinion pooling function for
pi−1  πi. Finally  since (4) deﬁnes the opinion pool pi recursively in terms of pi−1 ∀i = 1  2  . . .   n 
(cid:3)
we can invoke Lemma 1 to obtain the desired result.

5

There are several points worth noting about this result. First  since the updated market price pi is
also equivalent to agent i’s action (Section 2.2)  the R.H.S. of (4) is agent i’s risk-neutral probability
(Pennock [1999]) of {X = 1}  given her utility function  her action  and the current market state.
Thus  Lemma 3 is a natural extension of the elicitation properties of a MSR. MSRs  by design  elicit
subjective probabilities from risk-neutral agents in an incentive compatible manner; we show that  in
general  they elicit risk-neutral probabilities when they interact with risk-averse agents. Lemma 3 is
also consistent with the observation of Pennock [1999] that  for all belief elicitation schemes based
on monetary incentives  an external observer can only assess a participant’s risk-neutral probability
uniquely; she cannot discern the participant’s belief and utility separately. Second  observe that
this pooling operation is accomplished by a MSR even without direct revelation. Finally  notice
the presence of the market maker’s own initial baseline p0 as a component in the ﬁnal aggregate;
however  for the examples we study below  the impact of p0 diminishes with the participation of
more and more informed agents  and we conjecture that this is a generic property.
In general  the exact form of this pooling function is determined by the complex interaction between
the MSR and agent utility  and a closed form of pi from (4) might not be attainable in many cases.
However  given a paticular MSR  we can venture to identify agent utility functions which give rise
to well-known opinion pools. Hence  for the rest of this paper  we focus on the logarithmic market
scoring rule (LMSR)  one of the most popular tools for implementing real-world prediction markets.

3.1 LMSR as LogOP for constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) utility
Theorem 2. If myopic agent i  having a subjective belief πi ∈ (0  1) and a risk-averse utility func-
tion satisfying our criteria  trades with a LMSR market with parameter b and current instantaneous
price pi−1  then the market’s updated price pi is identical to a logarithmic opinion pool between the
current price and the agent’s subjective belief  i.e.

i−1 + (1 − πi)αi(1 − pi−1)1−αi(cid:3)   αi ∈ (0  1) 

pi = παi

i p1−αi

if and only if agent i’s utility function is of the form

ui(c) = τi (1 − exp (−c/τi))  

c ∈ R ∪ {−∞ ∞} 

constant τi ∈ (0 ∞) 

the aggregation weight being given by αi = τi/b

1+τi/b .

(5)

(6)

The proof is in Section 2.1 of the Supplementary Material. Note that (6) is a standard formulation
of the CARA (or negative exponential) utility function with risk tolerance τi; smaller the value of
τi  higher is agent i’s aversion to risk. The unbounded domain of ui(·) indicates a lack of budget
constraints; risk aversion comes about from the fact that the range of the function is bounded above
(by its risk tolerance τi) but not bounded below.
Moreover  the LogOP equation (5) can alternatively be expressed as a linear update in terms of
log-odds ratios  another popular means of formulating one’s belief about a binary event:

l(p) = ln(cid:0) p

1−p

(cid:1) ∈ [−∞ ∞]

for p ∈ [0  1].

l(pi) = αil(πi) + (1 − αi)l(pi−1) 

(7)
Aggregation weight and risk tolerance: Since αi is an increasing function of an agent’s risk
tolerance relative to the market’s loss parameter (the latter being  in a way  a measure of how much
risk the market maker is willing to take)  identity (7) implies that the higher an agent’s risk tolerance 
the larger is the contribution of her belief towards the changed market price  which agrees with
intuition. Also note the interesting manner in which the market’s loss parameter effectively scales
down an agent’s risk tolerance  enhancing the inertia factor (1 − αi) of the price process.
Bayesian interpretation: The Bayesian interpretation of LogOP in general is well-known (Bordley
[1982]); we restate it here in a form that is more appropriate for our prediction market setting. We
can recast (5) as pi = pi−1
. This shows
that  over the ith trading episode ∀i  the LMSR-CARA agent market environment is equivalent
to a Bayesian learner performing inference on the point estimate of the probability of the forecast
event X  starting with the common-knowledge prior Pr(X = 1) = pi−1  and having direct access
to πi (which corresponds to the “observation” for the inference problem)  the likelihood function

associated with this observation being L (X = x|πi) ∝(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 1−x−πi

Sequence of one-shot traders:

n = αn. Interestingly  the weight of an
agent’s belief depends not only on her own risk tolerance but also on those of all agents succeeding
her in the trading sequence (lower weight for a more risk tolerant successor  ceteris paribus)  and is
independent of her predecessors’ utility parameters. This is sensible since  by the design of a MSR 
trader i’s belief-dependent action inﬂuences the action of each of (rational) traders i + 1  i + 2  . . .
so that the action of each of these successors  in turn  has a role to play in determining the market
impact of trader i’s belief. In particular  if τj = τ > 0 ∀j ≥ 1  then the aggregation weights satisfy
j = 1 + τ /b > 1 ∀j = 1 ···   n− 1  i.e. LMSR assigns progessively higher
weights to traders arriving later in the market’s lifetime when they all exhibit identical constant risk
aversion. This seems to be a reasonable aggregation principle in most scenarios wherein the amount
0 = τ /b which
indicates that the weight of the market’s baseline belief in the aggregate may be higher than those of
some of the trading agents if the market maker has a comparatively high loss parameter. This strong
effect of the trading sequence on the weights of agents’ beliefs is a signiﬁcant difference between the
one-shot trader setting and the market equilibrium setting where each agent’s weight is independent
of the utility function parameters of her peers.

3.2 LMSR as LinOP for an atypical utility with decreasing absolute risk aversion
Theorem 3. If myopic agent i  having a subjective belief πi ∈ (0  1) and a risk-averse utility func-
tion satisfying our criteria  trades with a LMSR market with parameter b and current instantaneous
price pi−1  then the market’s updated price pi is identical to a linear opinion pool between the
current price and the agent’s subjective belief  i.e.

pi = βiπi + (1 − βi)pi−1 

for some constant βi ∈ (0  1) 

if and only if agent i’s utility function is of the form

ui(c) = ln(exp((c + Bi)/b) − 1) 

c ≥ −Bi 

(8)

(9)

i (c)/u(cid:48)

where Bi > 0 represents agent i’s budget  the aggregation weight being βi = 1 − exp(−Bi/b).
The proof is in Section 2.2 of the Supplementary Material. The above atypical utility function has
its domain bounded below  and possesses a positive but strictly decreasing Arrow-Pratt absolute
risk aversion measure (Mas-Colell et al. [1995]) Ai(c) = −u(cid:48)(cid:48)
b(exp((c+Bi)/b)−1) for
any b  Bi > 0.
It shares these characteristics with the well-known logarithmic utility function.
Moreover  although this function is approximately linear for large (positive) values of the wealth c 
it is approximately logarithmic when (c + Bi) (cid:28) b.
Theorem 3 is somewhat surprising since it is logarithmic utility that has traditionally been found to
effect a LinOP in a market equilibrium (Pennock [1999]  Beygelzimer et al. [2012]  Storkey et al.
[2015]  etc.). Of course in this paper  we are not in an equilibrium / convergence setting  but in light
of the above similarities between utility function (9) and logarithmic utility  it is perhaps not unrea-
sonable to ask whether the logarithmic utility-LinOP connection is still maintained approximately
for LMSR price evolution under some conditions. We have extensively explored this idea  both an-
alytically and by simulations  and have found that a small agent budget compared to the LMSR loss
parameter b seems to produce the desired result (see Section 3 of the Supplementary Material).

i(c) =

i + (1 − πi)pmin

i

Note that  unlike in Theorem 2  the equivalence here requires the agent utility function to depend on
the market maker’s loss parameter b (the scaling factor in the exponential). Since the microstructure
is assumed to be common knowledge  as in traditional MSR settings  the consideration of an agent
utility that takes into account the market’s pricing function is not unreasonable.
Since the domain of utility function (9) is bounded below  we can derive πi-independent bounds on
= βi + (1 − βi)pi−1. Hence 
possible values of pi from Lemma 2: pmin
  i.e. the revised price is a linear interpolation
equation (8) becomes pi = πipmax
between the agent’s price bounds  her subjective probability itself acting as the interpolation factor.
Aggregation weight and budget constraint: Evidently  the aggregation weight of agent i’s be-
lief  βi = (1 − exp(−Bi/b))  is an increasing function of her budget normalized with respect to
the market’s loss parameter; it is  in a way  a measure of her relative risk tolerance. Thus  broad
characteristics analogous to the ones in Section 3.1 apply to these aggregation weights as well  with
the log-odds ratio replaced by the actual market price.
Bayesian interpretation: Under the mild technical assumption that agent i’s belief πi ∈ (0  1) is
rational  and her budget Bi > 0 is such that βi ∈ (0  1) is also rational  it is possible to obtain positive
integers ri  Ni and a positive rational number mi−1 such that πi = ri/Ni and βi = Ni/(mi−1+Ni).
Then  we can rewrite the LinOP equation (8) as pi = ri+pi−1mi−1
  which is equivalent to the poste-
mi−1+Ni
rior expectation of a beta-binomial Bayesian inference procedure described as follows: The forecast
event X is modeled as the (future) ﬁnal ﬂip of a biased coin with an unknown probability of heads.
In episode i  the principal (or aggregator) has a prior distribution BETA(µi−1  νi−1) over this prob-
ability  with µi−1 = pi−1mi−1  νi−1 = (1 − pi−1)mi−1. Thus  pi−1 is the prior mean and mi−1
the corresponding “pseudo-sample size” parameter. Agent i is non-Bayesian  and her subjective
probability πi  accessible to the aggregator  is her maximum likelihood estimate associated with the
(binomial) likelihood of observing ri heads out of a private sample of Ni independent ﬂips of the
above coin (Ni is common knowledge). Note that mi−1  Ni are measures of certainty of the aggre-
gator and the trading agent respectively  and the latter’s normalized budget Bi/b = ln(1+Ni/mi−1)
becomes a measure of her certainty relative to the aggregator’s current state in this interpretation.

4 Discussion and future work

We have established the correspondence of a well-known securities market microstructure to a class
of traditional belief aggregation methods and  by extension  Bayesian inference procedures in two
important cases. An obvious next step is the identiﬁcation of general conditions under which a MSR
and agent utility combination is equivalent to a given pooling operation. Another research direction
is extending our results to a sequence of agents who trade repeatedly until “convergence”  taking into
account issues such as the order in which agents trade when they return  the effects of the updated
wealth after the ﬁrst trade for agents with budgets  etc.
