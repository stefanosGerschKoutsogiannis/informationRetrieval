Abstract

Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder that has eluded a characterization
in terms of local abnormalities of brain activity  and is hypothesized to affect the
collective  “emergent” working of the brain. We propose a novel data-driven ap-
proach to capture emergent features using functional brain networks [4] extracted
from fMRI data  and demonstrate its advantage over traditional region-of-interest
(ROI) and local  task-speciﬁc linear activation analyzes. Our results suggest that
schizophrenia is indeed associated with disruption of global brain properties re-
lated to its functioning as a network  which cannot be explained by alteration of
local activation patterns. Moreover  further exploitation of interactions by sparse
Markov Random Field classiﬁers shows clear gain over linear methods  such as
Gaussian Naive Bayes and SVM  allowing to reach 86% accuracy (over 50% base-
line - random guess)  which is quite remarkable given that it is based on a single
fMRI experiment using a simple auditory task.

1 Introduction

It has been long recognized that extracting an informative set of application-speciﬁc features from
the raw data is essential in practical applications of machine learning  and often contributes even
more to the success of learning than the choice of a particular classiﬁer. In biological applications 
such as brain image analysis  proper feature extraction is particularly important since the primary
objective of such studies is to gain a scientiﬁc insight rather than to learn a “black-box” predictor;
thus  the focus shifts towards the discovery of predictive patterns  or “biomarkers”  forming a basis
for interpretable predictive models. Conversely  biological knowledge can drive the deﬁnition of
features and lead to more powerful classiﬁcation.
The objective of this work is to identify biomarkers predictive of schizophrenia based on fMRI
data collected for both schizophrenic and non-schizophrenic subjects performing a simple auditory
task in the scanner [14]. Unlike some other brain disorders (e.g.  stroke or Parkinsons disease) 
schizophrenia appears to be “delocalized”  i.e. difﬁcult to attribute to a dysfunction of some par-

1

ticular brain areas1. The failure to identify speciﬁc areas  as well as the controversy over which
localized mechanisms are responsible for the symptoms associated with schizophrenia  have led us
amongst others [7  1  10] to hypothesize that this disease may be better understood as a disruption of
the emergent  collective properties of normal brain states  which can be better captured by functional
networks [4]  based on inter-voxel correlation strength  as opposed (or limited) to activation failures
localized to speciﬁc  task-dependent areas.
To test this hypothesis  we measured diverse topological features of the functional networks and
compared them across the normal subjects and schizophrenic patients groups. Speciﬁcally  we
decided to ask the following questions: (1) What speciﬁc effects does schizophrenia have on the
functional connectivity of brain networks? (2) Does schizophrenia affect functional connectivity
in ways that are congruent with the effect it has on area-speciﬁc  task-dependent activations? (3)
Is it possible to use functional connectivity to improve the classiﬁcation accuracy of schizophrenic
patients?
In answer to these questions  we will show that degree maps  which assign to each voxel the number
of its neighbors in a network  identify spatially clustered groups of voxels with statistically signif-
icant group (i.e. normal vs. schizophrenic) differences; moreover  these highly signiﬁcant voxel
subsets are quite stable over different data subsets. In contrast  standard linear activation maps com-
monly used in fMRI analysis show much weaker group differences as well as stability. Moreover 
degree maps yield very informative features  allowing for up to 86% classiﬁcation accuracy (with
50% baseline)  as opposed to standard local voxel activations. The best accuracy is achieved by fur-
ther exploiting non-local interactions with probabilistic graphical models such as Markov Random
Fields  as opposed to linear classiﬁers.
Finally  we demonstrate that traditional approaches based on a direct comparison of the correlation
at the level of relevant regions of interest (ROIs) or using a functional parcellation technique [17] 
do not reveal any statistically signiﬁcant differences between the groups. Indeed  a more data-driven
approach that exploits properties of voxel-level networks appears to be necessary in order to achieve
high discriminative power.
2 Background and Related Work

In Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)  a MR scanner non-invasively records a sub-
ject’s blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal  known to be correlated with neural activ-
ity  as a subject performs a task of interest (e.g.  viewing a picture or reading a sentence). Such scans
produce a sequence of 3D images  where each image typically has on the order of 10 000-100 000
subvolumes  or voxels  and the sequence typically contains a few hundreds of time points  or TRs
(time repetitions). Standard fMRI analysis approaches  such as the General Linear Model (GLM)
[9]  examine mass-univariate relationships between each voxel and the stimulus in order to build
so-called statistical parametric maps that associate each voxel with some statistics that reﬂects its
relationship to the stimulus. Commonly used activation maps depict the “activity” level of each
voxel determined by the linear correlation of its time course with the stimulus (see Supplemental
Material for details).
Clearly  such univariate analysis can miss important information contained in the interactions among
voxels. Indeed  as it was shown in [8]  highly predictive models of mental states can be built from
voxels with sub-maximal activation. Recently  applying multivariate predictive methods to fMRI
became an active area of research  focused on predicting “mental states” from fMRI data [11  13  2].
However  our focus herein is not just predictive modeling  but rather discovery of interpretable
features with high discriminative power. Also  our problem is much more high-dimensional  since
each sample (e.g.  schizophrenic vs. non-schizophrenic) corresponds to a sequence of 3D images
over about 400 time points  rather than to a single 3D image as in [11  13  2].
While the importance of modeling brain connectivity and interactions became widely recognized in
the current fMRI-analysis literature [6  19  16]  practical applications of the proposed approaches
such as dynamic causal modeling [6]  dynamic Bays nets [19]  or structural equations [16] were

1This is often referred to as the disconnectionhypothesis[5  15]  and can be traced back to the early research
on schizophrenia: in 1906  Wernicke [18] was the ﬁrst one to postulate that anatomical disruption of association
ﬁber tracts is at the roots of psychosis; in fact  the term schizophrenia was introduced by Bleuler [3] in 1911 
and was meant to describe the separation (splitting) of different mental functions.

usually limited to interactions analysis among just a few (e.g.  less than 15) known brain regions
believed to be relevant to the task or phenomenon of interest. In this paper  we demonstrate that such
model-based region-of-interest (ROI) analysis may fail to reveal informative interactions which 
nevertheless  become visible at the ﬁner-grain voxel level when using a purely data-driven  network-
based approach [4]. Moreover  while recent publications have already indicated that functional
networks in the schizophrenic brain display disrupted topological properties  we demonstrate  for
the ﬁrst time  that (1) speciﬁc topological properties (e.g. voxel degrees) of functional networks can
help to construct highly-predictive schizophrenia classiﬁers that generalize well and (2) functional
network differences cannot be attributed to alteration of local activation patterns  a hypothesis that
was not ruled out by the results of [1  10] and similar work.
3 Experimental Setup
The present study is a reanalysis of image datasets previously acquired according to the method-
ology described in [14]. Two groups of 12 subjects each were submitted to the same experimental
paradigm involving language: schizophrenic patients and age-matched normal controls (same ex-
periment was performed with a third group of alcoholic patients  yielding similar results - see Suppl.
Materials for details). The studies had been performed after approval of the local ethics committee
and all subjects were studied after they gave written informed consent. The task is based on au-
ditory stimuli; subjects listen to emotionally neutral sentences either in native (French) or foreign
language. Average length (3.5 sec mean) or pitch of both kinds of sentences is normalized. In order
to catch attention of subjects  each trial begins with a short (200 ms) auditory tone  followed by
the actual sentence. The subject’s attention is asserted through a simple validation task: after each
played sentences  a short pause of 750 ms is followed by a 500 ms two-syllable auditory cue  which
belongs to the previous sentence or not  to which the subject must answer to by yes (the cue is part
of the previous sentence) or no with push-buttons  when the language of the sentence was his own.
For each subject  two fMRI acquisition runs are acquired  each of which consisted of 420-scans
(from which the ﬁrst 4 are discarded to eliminate T1 effect). A full fMRI run contains 96 trials  with
32 sentences in French (native)  32 sentences in foreign languages  and 32 silence interval controls.
Data were spatially realigned and warped into the MNI template and smoothed (FWHM of 5mm)
using SPM5 (www.ﬁl.ucl.ac.uk); also  standard SPM5 motion correction was performed. Several
subjects were excluded from the consideration due to excessive head motion in the scanner  leav-
ing us with 11 schizophrenic and 11 healthy subjects  i.e. the total of 44 samples (there were two
samples per subject  corresponding to the two runs of the experiment). Each sample associated with
roughly 53 000 voxels (after removing out-of-brain voxels from the original 53 × 63 × 46 image) 
over 420 time points (TRs)  i.e. with more than 22 000 000 voxels/variables. Thus  some kind of
dimensionality reduction and/or feature extraction is necessary prior to learning a predictive model.
4 Methods
We explored two different data analysis approaches aimed at discovery of discriminative patterns:
(1) model-driven approaches based on prior knowledge about the regions of interest (ROI) that are
believed to be relevant to schizophrenia  or model-based functional clustering  and (2) data-driven
approaches based on various features extracted from the fMRI data  such as standard activation maps
and a set of topological features derived from functional networks.
4.1 Model-Driven Approach using ROI
First  we decided to test whether the interactions between several known regions of interest (ROIs)
would contain enough discriminative information about schizophrenic versus normal subjects. Ten

3

regions of interests (ROI) were deﬁned using previous literature on schizophrenia and language
studies  including inferior  middle and superior left temporal cortex  left inferior temporal cortex 
left cuneus  left angular gyrus  right superior temporal  right angular gyrus  right posterior cingu-
lum  and anterior cingular cortex (Figure 1). Each region was deﬁned as a sphere of 12mm diameter
centered on the x y z coordinates of the corresponding ROI. Because predeﬁned regions of inter-
est may be based on too much a priori knowledge and miss important areas  we also ran a more
exploratory analysis. A second set of 600 ROI’s was deﬁned automatically using a parcellation al-
gorithm [17] that estimates  for each subject  a collection of regions based on task-based functional
signal similarity and position in the MNI space.
Time series were extracted as the spatial mean over each ROI  leading to 10 time series per subject
for the predeﬁned ROIs and 600 for the parcellation technique. The connectivity measures were
of two kinds. First  the correlation coefﬁcient was computed along time between ROIs blindly with
respect to the experimental paradigm. Additionally  we computed a psycho-physiological interaction
(PPI)  by contrasting the correlation coefﬁcient weighted by experimental conditions (i.e. correlation
weighted by the ”Language French” condition versus correlation weighted by ”Control” condition
after convolution with a standard hemodynamic response function). Those connectivity measures
were then tested for signiﬁcance using standards non parametric tests between groups (Wilcoxon
signed-rank test) with corrected p-values for multiple comparisons.
4.2 Data-driven Approach: Feature Extraction
Topological Features and Degree Maps. In order to continue investigating possible disruptions
of global brain functioning associated with schizophrenia  we decided to explore lower-level (as
compared to ROI-level) functional brain networks [4] constructed at the voxel level: (1) pair-wise
Pearson correlation coefﬁcients are computed among all pairs of time-series (vi(t)  vj(t)) where
vi(i) corresponds to the BOLD signal of i-th voxel; (2) an edge between a pair of voxels (i  j) is
included in the network if the correlation between vi and vj exceeds a speciﬁed threshold (herein 
we used the same threshold of c(Pearson)=0.7 for all voxel pairs).
For each subject  and each run  a separate functional network was constructed. Next  we measured
a number of its topological features  including the degree distribution  mean degree  the size of the
largest connected subgraph (giant component)  and so on (see the supplemental material for the full
list). Besides global topological features  we also computed a series of degree maps based on the
individual voxel degree in functional network: (1) full degree maps  where the value assigned to
each voxel is the total number of links in the corresponding network node  (2) long-distance degree
maps  where the value is the number of links making non-local connections (5 voxels apart or more) 
and (3) inter-hemispheric degree maps  where only links reaching across the brain hemispheres are
considered when computing each voxel’s degree.
Activation maps. To ﬁnd out whether local task-dependent linear activations alone could possibly
explain the differences between the schizophrenic and normal brains  we used as a baseline set of
features based on the standard voxel activation maps. For each subject  and for each run  activation
maps  as well as their differences  or activation contrast maps  were obtained using several regressors
based on the language task  as described in the supplemental material (for simplicity  we will refer
to all such maps as activation maps). The activation values of each voxel were subsequently used
as features in the classiﬁcation task. Similarly to degree maps  we also computed a global feature 
mean-activation (mean-t-val))  by taking the mean absolute value of the voxel’s t-statistics. Both
activation and degree maps for each sample were also normalized  i.e. divided by their maximal
value for the given sample.
4.3 Classiﬁcation Approaches
First  off-the-shelf methods such Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM)
were used in order to compare the discriminative power of different sets of features described above.
Moreover  we decided to further investigate our hypothesis that interactions among voxels contain
highly discriminative information  and compare those linear classiﬁers against probabilistic graph-
ical models that explicitly model such interactions. Speciﬁcally  we learn a classiﬁer based on a
sparse Gaussian Markov Random Field (MRF) model [12]  which leads to a convex problem with
unique optimal solution  and can be solved efﬁciently; herein  we used the COVSEL procedure [12].
The weight on the l1-regularization penalty serves as a tuning parameter of the classiﬁer  allowing
to control the sparsity of the model  as described below.

voxels)  and let G = (V  E) be an undirected graphical model (Markov Network  or MRF) rep-
resenting conditional independence structure of the joint distribution P (X). The set of vertices
V = {1  ...  p} is in the one-to-one correspondence with the set X. There is no edge between Xi
and Xj if and only if the two variables are conditionally independent given all remaining variables.
Let x = (x1  ...  xp) denote a random assignment to X. We will assume a multivariate Gaussian

Missing edges in the above graphical model correspond to zero entries in the inverse covariance ma-
trix C  and thus the problem of learning the structure for the above probabilistic graphical model is
equivalent to the problem of learning the zero-pattern of the inverse-covariance matrix 2. A popular
approach is to use l1-norm regularization that is known to promote sparse solutions  while still al-
lowing (unlike non-convex lq-norm regularization with 0 < q < 1) for efﬁcient optimization. From
the Bayesian point of view  this is equivalent to assuming that the parameters of the inverse covari-

where det(A) and tr(A) denote the determinant and the trace (the sum of the diagonal elements) of

the (inverse) covariance matrix parameter) for each class
Y = {0  1} (schizophrenic vs non-schizophrenic)  and then choose the most-likely class label
arg maxc p(x|c)P (c) for each unlabeled test sample x.
Variable Selection: We used variable selection as a preprocessing step before applying a partic-
ular classiﬁer  in order to (1) reduce the computational complexity of classiﬁcation (especially for
sparse MRF  which  unlike GNB and SVM  could not be directly applied to over 50 000 variables) 
(2) reduce noise and (3) identify relatively small predictive subsets of voxels. We applied a sim-
ple ﬁlter-based approach  selecting a subset of top-ranked voxels  where the ranking criterion used
p-values resulting from the paired t-test  with the null-hypothesis being that the voxel values cor-
responding to schizophrenic and non-schizophrenic subjects came from distributions with equal
means. The variables were ranked in the ascending order of their p-values (lower p = higher conﬁ-
dence in between-group differences)  and classiﬁcation results on top k voxels will be presented for
a range of k values.
Evaluation via Cross-validation. We used leave-one-subject-out rather than leave-one-sample-out
cross-validation  since the two runs (two samples) for each subject are clearly not i.i.d. and must be
handled together to avoid biases towards overly-optimistic results.
5 Results
Model-driven ROI analysis. First  we observed that correlations (blind to experimental paradigm)
between regions and within subjects were very strong and signiﬁcant (p-value of 0.05  corrected
for the number of comparisons) when tested against 0 for all subjects (mean correlation > 0.8 for
every group). However  these inter-region correlations do not seem to differ signiﬁcantly between
the groups. The parcellation technique led to some smaller p-values  but also to a stricter correction
for multiple comparison and no correlation was close to the corrected threshold. Concerning the
psycho-physiological interaction  results were closer to signiﬁcance  but did not survive multiple
comparisons. In conclusion  we could not detect signiﬁcant differences between the schizophrenic
patient data and normal subjects in either the BOLD signal correlation or the interaction between
the signal and the main experimental contrast (native language versus silence).

2Note that the inverse of the empirical covariance matrix  even if it exists  does not typically contain exact

zeros. Therefore  an explicit sparsity constraint is usually added to the estimation process.

voxels with p < α · k/N (α - false-positive rate  k - the index of a p-value in the sorted sequence  N - the total

inter-hemispheric degree maps  respectively) of highly-signiﬁcant (very low) p-values  staying far below the
FDR cut-off line  while only a few voxels survive FDR in case of activation maps: 7 and 2 voxels in activation
maps 1 (contrast “FrenchNative - Silence”) and 6 (“FrenchNative”)  respectively (the rest of the activation maps
do not survive the FDR correction at all).

Data-driven analysis: topological vs activation features. Empirical results are consistent with our
hypothesis that schizophrenia disrupts the normal structure of functional networks in a way that is
not derived from alterations in the activation; moreover  they demonstrate that topological properties
are highly predictive  consistently outperforming predictions based on activations.
1. Voxel-wise statistical analysis. Degree maps show much stronger statistical differences be-
tween the schizophrenic vs. non-schizophrenic groups than the activation maps. Figure 2 show
the 2-sample t-test results for the full degree map and the activation maps  after False-Discovery
Rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons (standard in fMRI analysis)  at α = 0.05 level
(i.e.  5% false-positive rate). While the degree map (Figure 2a) shows statistically signiﬁcant differ-
ences bilaterally in auditory areas (speciﬁcally  normal group has higher degrees than schizophrenic
group)  the activation maps show almost no signiﬁcant differences at all: practically no voxels there
survived the FDR correction (Figure 2b. This suggests that (a) the differences in the collective be-
havior cannot be explained by differences in the linear task-related response  and that (b) topology
of voxel-interaction networks is more informative than task-related activations  suggesting an ab-
normal degree distribution for schizophrenic patients that appear to lack hubs in auditory cortex 
i.e.  have signiﬁcantly lower (normalized) voxel degrees in that area than the normal group (possibly
due to a more even spread of degrees in schizophrenic vs. normal networks). Moreover  degree
maps demonstrate much higher stability than activation maps with respect to selecting a subset of
top ranked voxels over different subsets of data. Figure 3a shows that degree maps have up to
almost 70% top-ranked voxels in common over different training data sets when using the leave-
one-subject out cross-validation  while activation maps have below 50% voxels in common between
different selected subsets. This property of degree vs activation features is particularly important for
interpretability of predictive modeling.
2. Inter-hemispheric degree distributions. A closer look at the degree distributions reveals that a
large percentage of the differential connectivity appears to be due to long-distance  inter-hemispheric
links. Figure 3a compares (normalized) histograms  for schizophrenic (red) versus normal (blue)
groups  of the fraction of inter-hemispheric connections over the total number of connections  com-
puted for each subject within the group. The schizophrenic group shows a signiﬁcant bias towards
low relative inter-hemispheric connectivity. A t-test analysis of the distributions indicates that dif-
ferences are statistically signiﬁcant (p=2.5x10-2). Moreover  it is evident that a major contributor to
the high degree difference discussed before is the presence of a large number of inter-hemispheric
connections in the normal group  which is lacking in schizophrenic group. Furthermore  we selected

right ROIs was computed as the fraction of ROI-to-ROI connections over all connections; Figure
3c shows the normalized histograms. Clearly  the normal group displays a high density of inter-
hemispheric connections  which are signiﬁcantly disrupted in the schizophrenic group (p=3.7x10-
7). This provides a strong indication that the group differences in connectivity cannot be explained
by differences in local activation.
3. Global features. For each global feature (full list in Suppl. Mat.) we computed its mean for
each group and p-value produced by the t-test  as well as the classiﬁcation accuracies using our
classiﬁers. While more details are presented in the supplemental material  we outline here the main
observations: while mean activation (we used map 8  the best performer for SVM on the full set of
voxels - see Table1b) had an relatively low p-value of 5.5 × 10−4  as compared to less signiﬁcant
p = 5.3 × 10−2 for mean-degree  the predictive power of the latter  alone or in combination with
some other features  was the best among global features reaching 27.5% in schizophrenic vs normal
classiﬁcation (Table 1a)  while mean activation yielded more than 40% error with all classiﬁers.
4. Classiﬁcation results using degree vs. activation maps. While mean-degree indicates the
presence of discriminative information in voxel degrees  its generalization ability  though the best
among global features and their combinations  is relatively poor. However  voxel-level degree maps
turned out to be excellent predictive features  often outperforming activation features by far. Table
1b compares prediction made by SVM on complete maps (without voxel subset selection): both
full and long-distance degree maps greatly outperform all activation maps  achieving 16% error
vs. above 30% for even the best-performing activation map 8. Next  in Figure 4  we compare the
predictive power of different maps when using all three classiﬁers: Support Vector Machines (SVM) 
Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and sparse Gaussian Markov Random Field (MRF)  on the subsets
of k top-ranked voxels  for a variety of k values. We used the best-performing activation map 8
from the Table above  as well as maps 1 and 6 (that survived FDR); map 6 was also outperforming
other activation maps in low-voxel regime. To avoid clutter  we only plot the two best-performing
degree maps out of three (i.e.  full and long-distance ones). For sparse MRF  we experimented with
a variety of λ values  ranging from 0.0001 to 10  and present the best results. We can see that: (a)
Degree maps frequently outperform activation maps  for all classiﬁers we used; the differences are

particularly noticeable when the number of selected voxels is relatively low. The most signiﬁcant
differences are observed for SVM in low-voxel (approx. < 500) and full-map regimes  as well as
for MRF classiﬁers: it is remarkable that degree maps can achieve an impressively low error of
14% with only 100 most signiﬁcant voxels  while even the best activation map 6 requires more than
200-300 to get just below 30% error; the other activation maps perform much worse  often above
30-40% error  or even just at the chance level. (b) Full and long-distance degree maps perform quite
similarly  with long-distance map achieving the best result (14% error) using MRFs. (c) Among the
activation maps only  while the map 8 (“Silence”) outperforms others on the full set of voxels using
SVM  its behavior in low-voxel regime is quite poor (always above 30-35% error); instead  map
6 (“FrenchNative”) achieves best performance among activation maps in this regime3. (d) MRF
classiﬁers clearly outperform SVM and GNB  possibly due to their ability to capture inter-voxel
relationships that are highly discriminative between the two classes (see Figure 4d).
6 Summary
The contributions of this paper are two-fold. From a machine-learning and fMRI analysis perspec-
tive  we (a) introduced a novel feature-construction approach based on topological properties of
functional networks  that is generally applicable to any multivariate-timeseries classiﬁcation prob-
lems  and can outperform standard linear activation approaches in fMRI analysis ﬁeld  (b) demon-
strated advantages of this data-driven approach over prior-knowledge-based (ROI) approaches  and
(c) demonstrated advantages of network-based classiﬁers (Markov Random Fields) over linear mod-
els (SVM  Naive Bayes) on fMRI data  suggesting to exploit voxel interactions in fMRI analyzes
(i.e.  treat brain as a network). From neuroscience perspective  we provided strong support for the
hypothesis that schizophrenia is associated with the disruption of global  emergent brain properties
which cannot be explained just by alteration of local activation patterns. Moreover  while prior art
is mainly focused on exploring the differences between the functional and anatomical networks of
schizophrenic patients versus healthy subjects [10  1]  this work  to our knowledge  is the ﬁrst at-
tempt to explore the generalization ability of predictive models of schizophrenia built on network
features.
Finally  a word of caution. Note that the schizophrenia patients studied here have been selected for
their prominent  persistent  and pharmaco-resistant auditory hallucinations [14]  which might have
increased their clinical homogeneity. However  the patient group is not representative of the full
spectrum of the disease  and thus our conclusions may not necessarily apply to all schizophrenia
patients  due to the clinical characteristics and size of the studied samples.

3We also observed that performing normalization really helped activation maps  since otherwise their per-

formance could get much worse  especially with MRFs - we provide those results in supplemental material.
