Abstract

Bandpass ﬁltering  orientation selectivity  and contrast gain control are prominent
features of sensory coding at the level of V1 simple cells. While the effect of
bandpass ﬁltering and orientation selectivity can be assessed within a linear model 
contrast gain control is an inherently nonlinear computation. Here we employ the
class of Lp elliptically contoured distributions to investigate the extent to which
the two features—orientation selectivity and contrast gain control—are suited to
model the statistics of natural images. Within this framework we ﬁnd that contrast
gain control can play a signiﬁcant role for the removal of redundancies in natural
images. Orientation selectivity  in contrast  has only a very limited potential for
redundancy reduction.

1 Introduction

It is a long standing hypothesis that sensory systems are adapted to the statistics of their inputs.
These natural signals are by no means random  but exhibit plenty of regularities. Motivated by
information theoretic principles  Attneave and Barlow suggested that one important purpose of this
adaptation in sensory coding is to model and reduce the redundancies [4; 3] by transforming the
signal into a statistically independent representation.
The problem of redundancy reduction can be split into two parts: (i) ﬁnding a good statistical model
of the natural signals and (ii) a way to map them into a factorial representation. The ﬁrst part
is relevant not only to the study of biological systems  but also to technical applications such as
compression and denoising. The second part offers a way to link neural response properties to
computational principles  since neural representations of natural signals must be advantageous in
terms of redundancy reduction if the hypothesis were true. Both aspects have been extensively
studied for natural images [2; 5; 8; 19; 20; 21; 24]. In particular  it has been shown that applying
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to natural images consistently and robustly yields ﬁlters
that are localized  oriented and show bandpass characteristics [19; 5]. Since those features are also
ascribed to the receptive ﬁelds of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1)  it has been suggested
that the receptive ﬁelds of V1 neurons are shaped to form a minimally redundant representation of
natural images [5; 19].
From a redundancy reduction point of view  ICA offers a small but signiﬁcant advantage over other
linear representations [6]. In terms of density estimation  however  it is a poor model for natural
images since already a simple non-factorial spherically symmetric model yields a much better ﬁt to
the data [10].
Recently  Lyu and Simoncelli proposed a method that converts any spherically symmetric distribu-
tion into a (factorial) Gaussian (or Normal distribution) by using a non-linear transformation of the

1

norm of the image patches [17]. This yields a non-linear redundancy reduction mechanism  which
exploits the superiority of the spherically symmetric model over ICA. Interestingly  the non-linearity
of this Radial Gaussianization method closely resembles another feature of the early visual system 
known as contrast gain control [13] or divisive normalization [20]. However  since spherically sym-
metric models are invariant under orthogonal transformations  they are agnostic to the particular
choice of basis in the whitened space. Thus  there is no role for the shape of the ﬁlters in this model.
Combining the observations from the two models of natural images  we can draw two conclusions:
On the one hand  ICA is not a good model for natural images  because a simple spherically sym-
metric model yields a much better ﬁt [10]. On the other hand  the spherically symmetric model in
Radial Gaussianization cannot capture that ICA ﬁlters do yield a higher redundancy reduction than
other linear transformations. This leaves us with the questions whether we can understand the emer-
gence of oriented ﬁlters in a more general redundancy reduction framework  which also includes a
mechanism for contrast gain control.
In this work we address this question by using the more general class of Lp-spherically symmetric
models [23; 12; 15]. These models are quite similar to spherically symmetric models  but do depend
on the particular shape of the linear ﬁlters. Just like spherically symmetric models can be non-
linearly transformed into isotropic Gaussians  Lp-spherically symmetric models can be mapped into
a unique class of factorial distributions  called p-generalized Normal distributions [11]. Thus  we
are able to quantify the inﬂuence of orientation selective ﬁlters and contrast gain control on the
redundancy reduction of natural images in a joint model.

2 Models and Methods

2.1 Decorrelation and Filters

All probabilistic models in this paper are deﬁned on whitened natural images. Let C be the co-
variance matrix of the pixel intensities for an ensemble x1  ...  xm of image patches  then C− 1
2
constitutes the symmetric whitening transform. Note that all vectors y = V C− 1
2 x  with V being
an orthogonal matrix  have unit covariance. V C− 1
2 yield the linear ﬁlters that are applied to the raw
image patches before feeding them in the probabilistic models described below. Since any decorre-
lation transform can be written as V C− 1
2   the choice of V determines the shape of the linear ﬁlters.
In our experiments  we use three different kinds of V :
SYM The simplest choice is VSYM = I  i. e. y = C− 1
2 x contains the coefﬁcients in the symmetric
whitening basis. From a biological perspective  this case is interesting as the ﬁlters resemble recep-
tive ﬁelds of retinal ganglion cells with center-surround properties.
ICA The ﬁlters VICA of ICA are determined by maximizing the non-Gaussanity of the marginal
distributions. For natural image patches  ICA is known to yield orientation selective ﬁlters in resem-
blance to V1 simple cells. While other orientation selective bases are possible  the ﬁlters deﬁned
by VICA correspond to the optimal choice for redundancy reduction under the restriction to linear
models.
HAD The coefﬁcients in the basis VHAD = 1√
m HVICA  with H denoting an arbitrary Hadamard
matrix  correspond to a sum over the different ICA coefﬁcients  each possibly having a ﬂipped sign.
Hadamard matrices are deﬁned by the two properties Hij = ±1 and HH(cid:62) = mI. This case can
be seen as the opposite extreme to the case of ICA. Instead of running an independent search for the
most Gaussian marginals  the central limit theorem is used to produce the most Gaussian compo-
nents by using the Hadamard transformation to mix all ICA coefﬁcients with equal weight resorting
to the independence assumption underlying ICA.

2.2 Lp-spherically Symmetric Distributions

The contour lines of spherically symmetric distributions have constant Euclidean norm. Simi-
larly  the contour lines of Lp-spherically symmetric distributions have constant p-norm1 ||y||p :=
1Note that ||y||p is only a norm in the strict sense if p ≥ 1. However  since the following considerations also
hold for 0 < p < 1  we will employ the term “p-norm” and the notation “||y||p” for notational convenience.

coordinate axis of Figure 1. For p (cid:54)= 2 the distribution is not invariant under arbitrary orthogonal
transformations  which means that the choice of the basis V can make a difference in the likelihood
of the data.

Figure 1: The spherically symmetric distributions are a subset of the Lp-spherical symmetric distri-
butions. The right shapes indicate the iso-density lines for the different distributions. The Gaussian
is the only L2-spherically symmetric distribution with independent marginals. Like the Gaussian
distribution  all p-generalized Normal distributions have independent marginals. ICA  SYM  ... de-
note the models used in the experiments below.

A multivariate random variable Y is called Lp-spherically symmetric distributed if it can be written
as a product Y = RU  where U is uniformly distributed on Sn−1
(1) and R is a univariate non-
negative random variable with an arbitrary distribution [23; 12]. Intuitively  R corresponds to the
radial component  i. e. the length ||y||p measured with the p-norm. U describes the directional com-
ponents in a polar-like coordinate system (see Extra Material). It can be shown that this deﬁnition
is equivalent to the density (y) of Y having the form (y) = f(||y||p
p) [12]. This immediately
suggests two ways of constructing an Lp-spherically symmetric distribution. Most obviously  one
can specify a density (y) that has the form (y) = f(||y||p
p). An example is the p-generalized
Normal distribution (gN) [11]

Analogous to the Gaussian being the only factorial spherically symmetric distribution [1]  this dis-
tribution is the only Lp-spherically symmetric distribution with independent marginals [22]. For the
p-generalized Normal  the marginals are members of the exponential power family.
In our experiments  we will use the p-generalized Normal to model linear marginal independence by
ﬁtting it to the coefﬁcients of the various bases in whitened space. Since this distribution is sensitive
to the particular ﬁlter shapes for p (cid:54)= 2  we can assess how well the distribution of the linearly
transformed image patches is matched by a factorial model.
An alternative way of constructing an Lp-spherically symmetric distribution is to specify the radial
distribution r. One example  which will be used later  is obtained by choosing a mixture of Log-
Normal distributions (RMixLogN). In Cartesian coordinates  this yields the density

Factorial DistributionsLp Spherically Symmetric DistributionsNormal DistributionpICAcICASYMcSYMHADcHADp-generalized Normal Distributionsp=2: Spherically Symmetric DistributionsAn immediate consequence of any Lp-spherically symmetric distribution being speciﬁed by its ra-
dial density is the possibility to change between any two of those distributions by transforming the
radial component with (F−1
◦ F1)(||y||p)  where F1 and F2 are cumulative distribution functions
(cdf) of the source and the target density  respectively. In particular  for a ﬁxed p  any Lp-spherically

This transform closely resembles contrast gain control models for primary visual cortex [13; 20] 
which use a different gain function having the form ˜g(y) = 1
We will use the distribution of equation (2) to describe the joint model consisting of a linear ﬁltering
step followed by a contrast gain control mechanism. Once  the linear ﬁlter responses in whitened
space are ﬁtted with this distribution  we non-linearly transform it into a the factorial p-generalized
Normal by the transformation g(y) · y = (F−1
Finally  note that because a Lp-spherically symmetric distribution is speciﬁed by its univariate radial
distribution  ﬁtting it to data boils down to estimating the univariate density for R  which can be done

3 Experiments and Results

3.1 Dataset

We use the dataset from the Bristol Hyperspectral Images Database [7]  which was already used in
previous studies [25; 16]. All images had a resolution of 256×256 pixels and were converted to gray
level by averaging over the channels. From each image circa 5000 patches of size 15×15 pixels were
drawn at random locations for training (circa 40000 patches in total) as well as circa 6250 patches
per image for testing (circa 50000 patches in total). In total  we sampled ten pairs of training and
test sets in that way. All results below are averaged over those. Before computing the linear ﬁlters 
the DC component was projected out with an orthogonal transformation using a QR decomposition.
Afterwards  the data was rescaled in order to make whitening a volume conserving transformation
(a transformation with determinant one) since those transformations leave the entropy unchanged.

the negative mean log-likelihood of the model distribution under the true distribution. If the model
distribution matches the true one  the ALL equals the entropy. Otherwise  the difference between
the ALL and the entropy of the true distribution is exactly the Kullback-Leiber divergence between
the two. The difference between the ALLs of two models equals the reduction in multi-information
(see Extra Material) and can therefore be used to quantify the amount of redundancy reduction.

3.3 Experiments

We ﬁtted the Lp-spherically symmetric distributions from equations (1) and (2) to the image patches
in the bases HAD  SYM  and ICA by a maximum likelihood ﬁt on the radial component. For the
mixture of Log-Normal distributions  we used EM for a mixture of Gaussians on the logarithm of
the p-norm of the image patches.
For each model  we computed the maximum likelihood estimate of the model parameters and deter-
mined the best value for p according to the ALL in bits per component on a training set. The ﬁnal
ALL was computed on a separate test set.
For ICA  we performed a gradient descent over the orthogonal group on the log-likelihood of a
product of independent exponential power distributions  where we used the result of the FastICA
algorithm by Hyv¨arinen et al. as initial starting point [14]. All transforms were computed separately
for each training set.

the radial component modeled by a mixture of Log-Normal distributions (cHAD  cSYM  cICA).
Right: Bar plot for the different ALL indicated by horizontal lines in the left plot.

In order to compare the redundancy reduction of the different transforms with respect to the pixel
basis (PIX)  we computed a non-parametric estimate of the marginal entropies of the patches before
the DC component was projected out [6]. Since the estimation is not bound to a particular parametric
model  we used the mean of the marginal entropies as an estimate of the average log-loss in the pixel
representation.

3.4 Results

Figure 2 and Table 1 show the ALL for the bases HAD  SYM  and ICA as a function of p. The
upper curve bundle represents the factorial p-generalized Normal model  the lower bundle the non-
factorial model with the radial component modeled by a mixture of Log-Normal distributions with
ﬁve mixtures. The ALL for the factorial models always exceeds the ALL for the non-factorial
models. At p = 2  all curves intersect  because all models are invariant under a change of basis for
that value. Note that the smaller ALL of the non-factorial model cannot be attributed to the mixture
of Log-Normal distributions having more degrees of freedom. As mentioned in the introduction  the
p-generalized Normal is the only factorial Lp-spherically symmetric distribution [22]. Therefore 
marginal independence is such a rigid assumption that the output scale is the only degree of freedom
left.
From the left plot in Figure 2  we can assess the inﬂuence of the different ﬁlter shapes and contrast
gain control on the redundancy reduction of natural images. We used the best ALL of the HAD
basis under the p-generalized Normal as a baseline for a whitening transformation without contrast
gain control (HAD). Analogously  we used the best ALL of the HAD basis under the non-factorial
model as a baseline for a pure contrast gain control model (cHAD). We compared these values
to the best ALL obtained by using the SYM and the ICA basis under both models. Because the
ﬁlters of SYM and ICA resemble receptive ﬁeld properties of retinal ganglion cells and V1 simple
cells  respectively  we can assess their possible inﬂuence on the redundancy reduction with and
without contrast gain control. The factorial model corresponds to the case without contrast gain
control (SYM and ICA). Since we have shown that the non-factorial model can be transformed into
a factorial one by a p-norm based divisive normalization operation  these scores correspond to the
cases with contrast gain control (cSYM and cICA). The different cases are depicted by the horizontal
lines in Figure 2.
As already reported in other works  plain orientation selectivity adds only very little to the redun-
dancy reduction achieved by decorrelation and is less effective than the baseline contrast gain con-
trol model [10; 6; 17]. If both orientation selectivity and contrast gain control are combined (cICA)
it is possible to achieve about 9% extra redundancy reduction in addition to baseline whitening

(HAD). By setting the other models in relation to the best joint model (cICA:= 100%)  we are able
to tell apart the relative contributions of bandpass ﬁltering (HAD= 91%)  particular ﬁlter shapes
(SYM= 93%  ICA= 94%)  contrast gain control (cHAD= 98.6%) as well as combined models
(cSYM= 99%  cICA := 100%) to redundancy reduction (see Table 1). Thus  orientation selectivity
(ICA) contributes less to the overall redundancy reduction than any model with contrast gain control
(cHAD  cSYM  cICA). Additionally  the relative difference between the joint model (cICA) and
plain contrast gain control (cHAD) is only about 1.4%. For cSYM it is even less  about 0.7%. The
difference in redundancy reduction between center-surround ﬁlters and orientation selective ﬁlters
becomes even smaller in combination with contrast gain control (1.3% for ICA vs. SYM  0.7% for
cICA vs. cSYM). However  it is still signiﬁcant (t-test  p = 5.5217 · 10−9).
When examining the gain functions g(||y||p) = (F−1
resulting from the transforma-
tion of the radial components  we ﬁnd that they approximately exhibit the form g(||y||p) = c||y||κ
.
The inset in Figure 3 shows the gain control function g(||y||p) in a log-log plot. While standard con-
trast gain control models assume p = 2 and κ = 2  we ﬁnd that κ between 0.90 and 0.93 to be opti-
mal for redundancy reduction. p depends on the shape of the linear ﬁlters and ranges from approx-
imately 1.2 to 2. In addition  existing contrast gain models assume the form g(||y||2) =
 
σ+||y||2
2
while we ﬁnd that σ must be approximately zero.
In the results above  the ICA ﬁlters always achieve the lowest ALL under both p-spherically sym-
metric models. For examining whether these ﬁlters really represent the best choice  we also opti-
mized the ﬁlter shapes under the model of equation (2) via maximum likelihood estimation on the
orthogonal group in whitened space [9; 18]. Figure 4 shows the ﬁlter shapes for ICA and the ones
obtained from the optimization  where we used either the ICA solution or a random orthogonal ma-
trix as starting point. Qualitatively  the ﬁlters look exactly the same. The ALL also changed just

ICA ﬁlters are a stable and optimal solution under the model with contrast gain control  too.

4 Summary

In this report  we studied the conjoint effect of contrast gain control and orientation selectivity on
redundancy reduction for natural images. In particular  we showed how the Lp-spherically distribu-
tion can be used to tune a nonlinearity of contrast gain control to remove higher-order redundancies
in natural images.
The idea of using an Lp-spherically symmetric model for natural images has already been brought
up by Hyv¨arinen and K¨oster in the context of Independent Subspace Analysis [15]. However  they
do not use the Lp-distribution for contrast gain control  but apply a global contrast gain control ﬁlter
on the images before ﬁtting their model. They also use a less ﬂexible Lp-distribution since their goal
is to ﬁt an ISA model to natural images and not to carry out a quantitative comparison as we did.
In our work  we ﬁnd that the gain control function turns out to follow a power law  which parallels
the classical model of contrast gain control. In addition  we ﬁnd that edge ﬁlters also emerge in the
non-linear model which includes contrast gain control. The relevance of orientation selectivity for
redundancy reduction  however  is further reduced. In the linear framework (possibly endowed with
a point-wise nonlinearity for each neuron) the contribution of orientation selectivity to redundancy
reduction has been shown to be smaller than 5% relative to whitening (i. e. bandpass ﬁltering)
alone [6; 10]. Here  we found that the contribution of orientation selectivity is even smaller than two
percent relative to whitening plus gain control. Thus  this quantitative model comparison provides
further evidence that orientation selectivity is not critical for redundancy reduction  while contrast
gain control may play a more important role.
