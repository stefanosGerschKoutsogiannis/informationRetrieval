Abstract

Information diffusion in online social networks is affected by the underlying net-
work topology  but it also has the power to change it. Online users are constantly
creating new links when exposed to new information sources  and in turn these
links are alternating the way information spreads. However  these two highly in-
tertwined stochastic processes  information diffusion and network evolution  have
been predominantly studied separately  ignoring their co-evolutionary dynamics.
We propose a temporal point process model  COEVOLVE  for such joint dyna-
mics  allowing the intensity of one process to be modulated by that of the other.
This model allows us to efﬁciently simulate interleaved diffusion and network
events  and generate traces obeying common diffusion and network patterns ob-
served in real-world networks. Furthermore  we also develop a convex optimiza-
tion framework to learn the parameters of the model from historical diffusion and
network evolution traces. We experimented with both synthetic data and data ga-
thered from Twitter  and show that our model provides a good ﬁt to the data as
well as more accurate predictions than alternatives.

1 Introduction
Online social networks  such as Twitter or Weibo  have become large information networks where
people share  discuss and search for information of personal interest as well as breaking news [1].
In this context  users often forward to their followers information they are exposed to via their
followees  triggering the emergence of information cascades that travel through the network [2] 
and constantly create new links to information sources  triggering changes in the network itself
over time. Importantly  recent empirical studies with Twitter data have shown that both information
diffusion and network evolution are coupled and network changes are often triggered by information
diffusion [3  4  5].
While there have been many recent works on modeling information diffusion [2  6  7  8] and network
evolution [9  10  11]  most of them treat these two stochastic processes independently and separately 
ignoring the inﬂuence one may have on the other over time. Thus  to better understand information
diffusion and network evolution  there is an urgent need for joint probabilistic models of the two
processes  which are largely inexistent to date.
In this paper  we propose a probabilistic generative model  COEVOLVE  for the joint dynamics of
information diffusion and network evolution. Our model is based on the framework of temporal
point processes  which explicitly characterize the continuous time interval between events  and it
consists of two interwoven and interdependent components (refer to Appendix B for an illustration):
I. Information diffusion process. We design an “identity revealing” multivariate Hawkes pro-
cess [12] to capture the mutual excitation behavior of retweeting events  where the intensity of
such events in a user is boosted by previous events from her time-varying set of followees. Al-

though Hawkes processes have been used for information diffusion before [13  14  15  16  17  18 
19]  the key innovation of our approach is to explicitly model the excitation due to a particular
source node  hence revealing the identity of the source. Such design reﬂects the reality that infor-
mation sources are explicitly acknowledged  and it also allows a particular information source to
acquire new links in a rate according to her “informativeness”.

II. Network evolution process. We model link creation as an “information driven” survival process 
and couple the intensity of this process with retweeting events. Although survival processes have
been used for link creation before [20  21]  the key innovation in our model is to incorporate re-
tweeting events as the driving force for such processes. Since our model has captured the source
identity of each retweeting event  new links will be targeted toward the information sources  with
an intensity proportional to their degree of excitation and each source’s inﬂuence.

Our model is designed in such a way that it allows the two processes  information diffusion and
network evolution  unfold simultaneously in the same time scale and excise bidirectional inﬂuence
on each other  allowing sophisticated coevolutionary dynamics to be generated (e.g.  see Figure 5).
Importantly  the ﬂexibility of our model does not prevent us from efﬁciently simulating diffusion
and link events from the model and learning its parameters from real world data:
• Efﬁcient simulation. We design a scalable sampling procedure that exploits the sparsity of the
generated networks. Its complexity is O(nd log m)  where n is the number of samples  m is the
number of nodes and d is the maximum number of followees per user.
• Convex parameters learning. We show that the model parameters that maximize the joint like-
Finally  we experimentally verify that our model can produce coevolutionary dynamics of infor-
mation diffusion and network evolution  and generate retweet and link events that obey common
information diffusion patterns (e.g.  cascade structure  size and depth)  static network patterns (e.g. 
node degree) and temporal network patterns (e.g.  shrinking diameter) described in related litera-
ture [22  10  23]. Furthermore  we show that  by modeling the coevolutionary dynamics  our model
provide signiﬁcantly more accurate link and diffusion event predictions than alternatives in large
scale Twitter dataset [3].

lihood of observed diffusion and link creation events can be found via convex optimization.

2 Backgrounds on Temporal Point Processes
A temporal point process is a random process whose realization consists of a list of discrete events
localized in time  {ti} with ti ∈ R+ and i ∈ Z+. Many different types of data produced in online
social networks can be represented as temporal point processes  such as the times of retweets and
link creations. A temporal point process can be equivalently represented as a counting process  N (t) 
which records the number of events before time t. Let the history H(t) be the list of times of events
{t1  t2  . . .   tn} up to but not including time t. Then  the number of observed events in a small time
window dt between [t  t+dt) is dN (t) =!ti∈H(t) δ(t−ti) dt  and hence N (t) =" t
0 dN (s)  where
δ(t) is a Dirac delta function. More generally  given a function f (t)  we can deﬁne the convolution
with respect to dN (t) as

f (t) ⋆dN (t) :=# t

0

f (t − τ ) dN (τ ) =$ti∈H(t)

f (t − ti).

(1)

The point process representation of temporal data is fundamentally different from the discrete time
representation typically used in social network analysis. It directly models the time interval between
events as random variables  and avoid the need to pick a time window to aggregate events. It allows
temporal events to be modeled in a more ﬁne grained fashion  and has a remarkably rich theoretical
support [24].
An important way to characterize temporal point processes is via the conditional intensity function
— a stochastic model for the time of the next event given all the times of previous events. For-
mally  the conditional intensity function λ∗(t) (intensity  for short) is the conditional probability of
observing an event in a small window [t  t + dt) given the history H(t)  i.e. 

λ∗(t)dt := P{event in [t  t + dt)|H(t)} = E[dN (t)|H(t)] 

(2)
where one typically assumes that only one event can happen in a small window of size dt 
i.e.  dN (t) ∈{ 0  1}. Then  given a time t′ ! t  we can also characterize the conditional proba-
bility that no event happens during [t  t′) and the conditional density that an event occurs at time t′

2

as S∗(t′) = exp(−" t′
express the log-likelihood of a list of events {t1  t2  . . .   tn} in an observation window [0  T ) as

t λ∗(τ ) dτ ) and f∗(t′) = λ∗(t′) S∗(t′) respectively [24]. Furthermore  we can

λ∗(τ ) dτ  T ! tn.

L =

log λ∗(ti) −# T

n$i=1

This simple log-likelihood will later enable us to learn the parameters of our model from observed
data.
Finally  the functional form of the intensity λ∗(t) is often designed to capture the phenomena of
interests. Some useful functional forms we will use later are [24]:

(i) Poisson process. The intensity is assumed to be independent of the history H(t)  but it can be
a time-varying function  i.e.  λ∗(t) = g(t) ! 0;
(ii) Hawkes Process. The intensity models a mutual excitation between events  i.e. 

λ∗(t) = µ + ακω(t) ⋆dN (t) = µ + α$ti∈H(t)

(4)
where κω(t) := exp(−ωt)I[t ! 0] is an exponential triggering kernel  µ ! 0 is a baseline
intensity independent of the history. Here  the occurrence of each historical event increases the
intensity by a certain amount determined by the kernel and the weight α ! 0  making the intensity
history dependent and a stochastic process by itself. We will focus on the exponential kernel in
this paper. However  other functional forms for the triggering kernel  such as log-logistic function 
are possible  and our model does not depend on this particular choice; and 
(iii) Survival process. There is only one event for an instantiation of the process  i.e. 

κω(t − ti) 

λ∗(t) = g∗(t)(1 − N (t)) 
where λ∗(t) becomes 0 if an event already happened before t.

3 Generative Model of Information Diffusion and Network Co-evolution
In this section  we use the above background on temporal point processes to formulate our proba-
bilistic generative model for the joint dynamics of information diffusion and network evolution.

3.1 Event Representation
We model the generation of two types of events: tweet/retweet events  er  and link creation events 
el. Instead of just the time t  we record each event as a triplet
source
↓s 
destination

:= ( u
↑

er or el

t
).
↑time

(6)

 

For retweet event  the triplet means that the destination node u retweets at time t a tweet originally
posted by source node s. Recording the source node s reﬂects the real world scenario that infor-
mation sources are explicitly acknowledged. Note that the occurrence of event er does not mean
that u is directly retweeting from or is connected to s. This event can happen when u is retweeting
a message by another node u′ where the original information source s is acknowledged. Node u
will pass on the same source acknowledgement to its followers (e.g.  “I agree @a @b @c @s”).
Original tweets posted by node u are allowed in this notation. In this case  the event will simply be
er = (u  u  t). Given a list of retweet events up to but not including time t  the history Hr
us(t) of
i = (ui  si  ti)|ui = u and si = s} . The entire history
retweets by u due to source s is Hr
of retweet events is denoted as Hr(t) := ∪u s∈[m]Hr
For link creation event  the triplet means that destination node u creates at time t a link to source
node s  i.e.  from time t on  node u starts following node s. To ease the exposition  we restrict
ourselves to the case where links cannot be deleted and thus each (directed) link is created only
once. However  our model can be easily augmented to consider multiple link creations and deletions
per node pair  as discussed in Section 8. We denote the link creation history as Hl(t).
3.2 Joint Model with Two Interwoven Components
Given m users  we use two sets of counting processes to record the generated events  one for infor-
mation diffusion and the other for network evolution. More speciﬁcally 

us(t) = {er

us(t).

3

I. Retweet events are recorded using a matrix N (t) of size m × m for each ﬁxed time point t. The
(u  s)-th entry in the matrix  Nus(t) ∈{ 0}∪ Z+  counts the number of retweets of u due to
source s up to time t. These counting processes are “identity revealing”  since they keep track of
the source node that triggers each retweet. This matrix N (t) can be dense  since Nus(t) can be
nonzero even when node u does not directly follow s. We also let dN (t) := ( dNus(t) )u s∈[m].
II. Link events are recorded using an adjacency matrix A(t) of size m× m for each ﬁxed time point
t. The (u  s)-th entry in the matrix  Aus(t) ∈{ 0  1}  indicates whether u is directly following s.
That is Aus(t) = 1 means the directed link has been created before t. For simplicity of exposition 
we do not allow self-links. The matrix A(t) is typically sparse  but the number of nonzero entries
can change over time. We also deﬁne dA(t) := ( dAus(t) )u s∈[m].

Then the interwoven information diffusion and network evolution processes can be characterized
using their respective intensities E[dN (t)|Hr(t) ∪H l(t)] = Γ∗(t) dt and E[dA(t)|Hr(t) ∪
Hl(t)] = Λ∗(t) dt  where Γ∗(t) = ( γ∗us(t) )u s∈[m] and Λ∗(t) = ( λ∗us(t) )u s∈[m]. The sign
∗ means that the intensity matrices will depend on the joint history  Hr(t) ∪H l(t)  and hence their
evolution will be coupled. By this coupling  we make: (i) the counting processes for link creation to
be “information driven” and (ii) the evolution of the linking structure to change the information dif-
fusion process. Refer to Appendix B for an illustration of our joint model. In the next two sections 
we will specify the details of these two intensity matrices.

Information Diffusion Process

3.3
We model the intensity  Γ∗(t)  for retweeting events using multivariate Hawkes process [12]:

κω1(t) ⋆ (Auv(t) dNvs(t))  

γ∗us(t) = I[u = s] ηu + I[u ̸= s] βs$v∈Fu(t)

(7)
where I[·] is the indicator function and Fu(t) := {v ∈ [m] : Auv(t) = 1} is the current set of follo-
wees of u. The term ηu ! 0 is the intensity of original tweets by a user u on his own initiative 
becoming the source of a cascade and the term βs!v∈Fu(t) κω(t) ⋆ (Auv(t) dNvs(t)) models the

propagation of peer inﬂuence over the network  where the triggering kernel κω1(t) models the decay
of peer inﬂuence over time.
Note that the retweet intensity matrix Γ∗(t) is by itself a stochastic process that depends on the time-
varying network topology  the non-zero entries in A(t)  whose growth is controlled by the network
evolution process in Section 3.4. Hence the model design captures the inﬂuence of the network
topology and each source’s inﬂuence  βs  on the information diffusion process. More speciﬁcally 
to compute γ∗us(t)  one ﬁrst ﬁnds the current set Fu(t) of followees of u  and then aggregates
the retweets of these followees that are due to source s. Note that these followees may or may
not directly follow source s. Then  the more frequently node u is exposed to retweets of tweets
originated from source s via her followees  the more likely she will also retweet a tweet originated
from source s. Once node u retweets due to source s  the corresponding Nus(t) will be incremented 
and this in turn will increase the likelihood of triggering retweets due to source s among the followers
of u. Thus  the source does not simply broadcast the message to nodes directly following her but
her inﬂuence propagates through the network even to those nodes that do not directly follow her.
Finally  this information diffusion model allows a node to repeatedly generate events in a cascade 
and is very different from the independent cascade or linear threshold models [25] which allow at
most one event per node per cascade.

λ∗us(t) = (1 − Aus(t))(µu + αu κω2(t) ⋆dN us(t))

3.4 Network Evolution Process
We model the intensity  Λ∗(t)  for link creation using a combination of survival and Hawkes process:
(8)
where the term 1 − Aus(t) effectively ensures a link is created only once  and after that  the corre-
sponding intensity is set to zero. The term µu ! 0 denotes a baseline intensity  which models when a
node u decides to follow a source s spontaneously at her own initiative. The term αuκω2(t)⋆dNus(t)
corresponds to the retweets of node u due to tweets originally published by source s  where the trig-
gering kernel κω2(t) models the decay of interests over time. Here  the higher the corresponding
retweet intensity  the more likely u will ﬁnd information by source s useful and will create a direct
link to s.

4

The link creation intensity Λ∗(t) is also a stochastic process by itself  which depends on the retweet
events  and is driven by the retweet count increments dNus(t). It captures the inﬂuence of retweets
on the link creation  and closes the loop of mutual inﬂuence between information diffusion and
network topology.
Note that creating a link is more than just adding a path or allowing information sources to take
shortcuts during diffusion. The network evolution makes fundamental changes to the diffusion
dynamics and stationary distribution of the diffusion process in Section 3.3. As shown in [14] 
given a ﬁxed network structure A  the expected retweet intensity µs(t) at time t due to source
s will depend of the network structure in a highly nonlinear fashion  i.e.  µs(t) := E[Γ∗·s(t)] =
(e(A−ω1I)t + ω1(A − ω1I)−1(e(A−ω1I)t − I)) ηs  where ηs ∈ Rm has a single nonzero entry
with value ηs and e(A−ω1I)t is the matrix exponential. When t → ∞  the stationary intensity
¯µs = (I − A/ω)−1 ηs is also nonlinearly related to the network structure. Thus given two network
structures A(t) and A(t′) at two points in time  which are different by a few edges  the effect of
these edges on the information diffusion is not just simply an additive relation. Depending on how
these newly created edges modify the eigen-structure of the sparse matrix A(t)  their effect can be
drastic to the information diffusion.

Remark 1. In our model  each user is exposed to information through a time-varying set of neigh-
bors. By doing so  we couple information diffusion with the network evolution  increasing the
practical application of our model to real-network datasets. The particular deﬁnition of exposure
(e.g.  a retweet’s neighbor) will depend on the type of historical information that is available. Re-
markably  the ﬂexibility of our model allows for different types of diffusion events  which we can
broadly classify into two categories. In a ﬁrst category  events corresponds to the times when an
information cascade hits a person  for example  through a retweet from one of her neighbors  but
she does not explicitly like or forward the associated post. In a second category  the person decides
to explicitly like or forward the associated post and events corresponds to the times when she does
so. Intuitively  events in the latter category are more prone to trigger new connections but are also
less frequent. Therefore  it is mostly suitable to large event dataset for examples those ones gener-
ated synthetically. In contrast  the events in the former category are less likely to inspire new links
but found in abundance. Therefore  it is very suitable for real-world sparse data. Consequently  in
synthetic experiments we used the latter and in the real one we used the former. It’s noteworthy that
Eq. (8) is written based on the latter category  but  Fig. 7 in appendix is drawn based on the former.

4 Efﬁcient Simulation of Coevolutionary Dynamics
We can simulate samples (link creations  tweets and retweets) from our model by adapting Ogata’s
thinning algorithm [26]  originally designed for multidimensional Hawkes processes. However  a
naive implementation of Ogata’s algorithm would scale poorly  i.e.  for each sample  we would
need to re-evaluate Γ∗(t) and Λ∗(t)  thus  to draw n samples  we would need to perform O(m2n2)
operations  where m is the number of nodes.
We designed a sampling procedure that is especially well-ﬁtted for the structure of our model. The
algorithm is based on the following key idea: if we consider each intensity function in Γ∗(t) and
Λ∗(t) as a separate Hawkes process and draw a sample from each  it is easy to show that the mini-
mum among all these samples is a valid sample from the model [12]. However  by drawing samples
from all intensities  the computational complexity would not improve. However  when the network
is sparse  whenever we sample a new node (or link) event from the model  only a small number
of intensity functions  in the local neighborhood of the node (or the link)  will change. As a con-
sequence  we can reuse most of the samples from the intensity functions for the next new sample
and ﬁnd which intensity functions we need to change in O(log m) operations  using a heap. Fi-
nally  we exploit the properties of the exponential function to update individual intensities for each
new sample in O(1): let ti and ti+1 be two consecutive events  then  we can compute λ∗(ti+1) as
(λ∗(ti) − µ) exp(−ω(ti+1 − ti)) + µ without the need to compare all previous events.
The complete simulation algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 2 in Appendix C. By using Algo-
rithm 2  we reduce the complexity from O(n2m2) to O(nd log m)  where d is the maximum number
of followees per node. That means  our algorithm scales logarithmically with the number of nodes
and linearly with the number of edges at any point in time during the simulation. We also note that
the events for link creations  tweets and retweets are generated in a temporally intertwined and inter-

leaving fashion by Algorithm 2. This is because every new retweet event will modify the intensity
for link creation  and after each link creation we also need to update the retweet intensities.
5 Efﬁcient Parameter Estimation from Coevolutionary Events
Given a collection of retweet events E = {er
i} recorded within
i} and link creation events A = {el
a time window [0  T )  we can easily estimate the parameters needed in our model using maximum
likelihood estimation. Here  we compute the joint log-likelihood L({µu}  {αu}  {ηu}  {βs}) of
these events using Eq. (3)  i.e. 
$er
’

For the terms corresponding to retweets  the log term only sums over the actual observed events 
but the integral term actually sums over all possible combination of destination and source pairs 
even if there is no event between a particular pair of destination and source. For such pairs with
no observed events  the corresponding counting processes have essentially survived the observation
0 γ∗us(τ )dτ simply corresponds to the log survival probability.

log%λ∗uisi(ti)& − $u s∈[m]# T

log%γ∗uisi(ti)& − $u s∈[m]# T

Terms corresponding to links have a similar structure to those for retweet.
Since γ∗us(t) and λ∗us are linear in the parameters (ηu  βs) and (µu  αu) respectively  then log(γ∗us(t))
and log(λ∗us) are concave functions in these parameters. Integration of γ∗us(t) and λ∗us still results
in linear functions of the parameters. Thus the overall objective in Eq. (9) is concave  and the global
optimum can be found by many algorithms. In our experiments  we adapt the efﬁcient algorithm
developed in previous work [18  19]. Furthermore  the optimization problem decomposes in m
independent problems  one per node u  and can be readily parallelized.
6 Properties of Simulated Co-evolution  Networks and Cascades∗
In this section  we perform an empirical investigation of the properties of the networks and infor-
mation cascades generated by our model. In particular  we show that our model can generate co-
evolutionary retweet and link dynamics and a wide spectrum of static and temporal network patterns
and information cascades. Appendix D contains additional simulation results and visualizations.
Appendix E contains an evaluation of our model estimation method in synthetic data.
Retweet and link coevolution. Figures 1(a b) visualize the retweet and link events  aggregated
across different sources  and the corresponding intensities for one node and one realization  picked
at random. Here  it is already apparent that retweets and link creations are clustered in time and often
follow each other. Further  Figure 1(c) shows the cross-covariance of the retweet and link creation
intensity  computed across multiple realizations  for the same node  i.e.  if f (t) and g(t) are two

intensities  the cross-covariance is a function of the time lag τ deﬁned as h(τ ) =" f (t + τ )g(t) dt.

It can be seen that the cross-covariance has its peak around 0  i.e.  retweets and link creations are

one node  however  we found consistent results across nodes.
Degree distribution. Empirical studies have shown that the degree distribution of online social
networks and microblogging sites follow a power law [9  1]  and argued that it is a consequence of
the rich get richer phenomena. The degree distribution of a network is a power law if the expected
number of nodes md with degree d is given by md ∝ d−γ  where γ> 0. Intuitively  the higher the
values of the parameters α and β  the closer the resulting degree distribution follows a power-law;
the lower their values  the closer the distribution to an Erdos-Renyi random graph [27]. Figure 2
conﬁrms this intuition by showing the degree distribution for different values of β.
Small (shrinking) diameter. There is empirical evidence that the diameter of online social networks
and microblogging sites exhibit relatively small diameter and shrinks (or ﬂattens) as the network
grows [28  9  22]. Figures 3(a-b) show the diameter on the largest connected component (LCC)
against the sparsity of the network over time for different values of α and β. Although at the
beginning  there is a short increase in the diameter due to the merge of small connected components 
the diameter decreases as the network evolves. Here  nodes arrive to the network when they follow
(or are followed by) a node in the largest connected component.
Cascade patterns. Our model can produce the most commonly occurring cascades structures as
well as heavy-tailed cascade size and depth distributions  as observed in historical Twitter data [23].
Figure 4 summarizes the results. The higher the α value  the shallower and wider the cascades.

7 Experiments on Real Dataset
In this section  we validate our model using a large Twitter dataset containing nearly 550 000 tweet 
retweet and link events from more than 280 000 users [3]. We will show that our model can capture
the co-evolutionary dynamics and  by doing so  it predicts retweet and link creation events more
accurately than several alternatives. Appendix F contains detailed information about the dataset and
additional experiments.
Retweet and link coevolution. Figures 5(a  b) visualize the retweet and link events  aggregated
across different sources  and the corresponding intensities given by our trained model for one node 
picked at random. Here  it is already apparent that retweets and link creations are clustered in time
and often follow each other  and our ﬁtted model intensities successfully track such behavior. Fur-
ther  Figure 5(c) compares the cross-covariance between the empirical retweet and link creation
intensities and between the retweet and link creation intensities given by our trained model  com-
puted across multiple realizations  for the same node. The similarity between both cross-covariances
is striking and both has its peak around 0  i.e.  retweets and link creations are highly correlated and
co-evolve over time. For ease of exposition  as in Section 6  we illustrated co-evolution using one
node  however  we found consistent results across nodes (see Appendix F).
Link prediction. We use our model to predict the identity of the source for each test link event 
given the historical (link and retweet) events before the time of the prediction  and compare its
performance with two state of the art methods  denoted as TRF [3] and WENG [5]. TRF measures

the probability of creating a link from a source at a given time by simply computing the proportion
of new links created from the source with respect to the total number of links created up to the given
time. WENG considers different link creation strategies and makes a prediction by combining them.
We evaluate the performance by computing the probability of all potential links using different
methods  and then compute (i) the average rank of all true (test) events (AvgRank) and  (ii) the
success probability (SP) that the true (test) events rank among the top-1 potential events at each test
time (Top-1). We summarize the results in Fig. 6(a-b)  where we consider an increasing number of
training retweet/tweet events. Our model outperforms TRF and WENG consistently. For example 
for 8 · 104 training events  our model achieves a SP 2.5x times larger than TRF and WENG.
Activity prediction. We use our model to predict the identity of the node that is going to generate
each test diffusion event  given the historical events before the time of the prediction  and compare
its performance with a baseline consisting of a Hawkes process without network evolution. For
the Hawkes baseline  we take a snapshot of the network right before the prediction time  and use
all historical retweeting events to ﬁt the model. Here  we evaluate the performance the via the
same two measures as in the link prediction task and summarize the results in Figure 6(c-d) against
an increasing number of training events. The results show that  by modeling the co-evolutionary
dynamics  our model performs signiﬁcantly better than the baseline.
8 Discussion
We proposed a joint continuous-time model of information diffusion and network evolution  which
can capture the coevolutionary dynamics  mimics the most common static and temporal network
patterns observed in real-world networks and information diffusion data  and predicts the network
evolution and information diffusion more accurately than previous state-of-the-arts. Using point
processes to model intertwined events in information networks opens up many interesting future
modeling work. Our current model is just a show-case of a rich set of possibilities offered by a point
process framework  which have been rarely explored before in large scale social network mode-
ling. For example  we can generalize our model to support link deletion by introducing an intensity
matrix Ξ∗(t) modeling link deletions as survival processes  i.e.  Ξ∗(t) = (g∗us(t)Aus(t))u s∈[m] 
and then consider the counting process A(t) associated with the adjacency matrix to evolve as
E[dA(t)|Hr(t) ∪H l(t)] = Λ∗(t) dt − Ξ∗(t) dt. We also can consider the number of nodes vary-
ing over time. Furthermore  a large and diverse range of point processes can also be used in the
framework without changing the efﬁciency of the simulation and the convexity of the parameter
estimation  e.g.  condition the intensity on additional external features  such as node attributes.
