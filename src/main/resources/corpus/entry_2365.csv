Abstract

We propose a new approach to the analysis of Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) by
establishing a formula that connects the Hessian of the Bethe free energy with the
edge zeta function. The formula has a number of theoretical implications on LBP.
It is applied to give a sufﬁcient condition that the Hessian of the Bethe free energy
is positive deﬁnite  which shows non-convexity for graphs with multiple cycles.
The formula clariﬁes the relation between the local stability of a ﬁxed point of
LBP and local minima of the Bethe free energy. We also propose a new approach
to the uniqueness of LBP ﬁxed point  and show various conditions of uniqueness.

1 Introduction

Pearl’s belief propagation [1] provides an efﬁcient method for exact computation in the inference
with probabilistic models associated to trees. As an extension to general graphs allowing cycles 
Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) algorithm [2] has been proposed  showing successful performance
in various problems such as computer vision and error correcting codes.

One of the interesting theoretical aspects of LBP is its connection with the Bethe free energy [3]. It
is known  for example  the ﬁxed points of LBP correspond to the stationary points of the Bethe free
energy. Nonetheless  many of the properties of LBP such as exactness  convergence and stability are
still unclear  and further theoretical understanding is needed.

This paper theoretically analyzes LBP by establishing a formula asserting that the determinant of
the Hessian of the Bethe free energy equals the reciprocal of the edge zeta function up to a positive
factor. This formula derives a variety of results on the properties of LBP such as stability and
uniqueness  since the zeta function has a direct link with the dynamics of LBP as we show.

The ﬁrst application of the formula is the condition for the positive deﬁniteness of the Hessian of
the Bethe free energy. The Bethe free energy is not necessarily convex  which causes unfavorable
behaviors of LBP such as oscillation and multiple ﬁxed points. Thus  clarifying the region where
the Hessian is positive deﬁnite is an importance problem. Unlike the previous approaches which
consider the global structure of the Bethe free energy such as [4  5]  we focus the local structure.
Namely  we provide a simple sufﬁcient condition that determines the positive deﬁnite region: if all
the correlation coefﬁcients of the pseudomarginals are smaller than a value given by a characteristic
of the graph  the Hessian is positive deﬁnite. Additionally  we show that the Hessian always has a
negative eigenvalue around the boundary of the domain if the graph has at least two cycles.

Second  we clarify a relation between the local stability of a LBP ﬁxed point and the local structure
of the Bethe free energy. Such a relation is not necessarily obvious  since LBP is not the gradient
descent of the Bethe free energy. In this line of studies  Heskes [6] shows that a locally stable ﬁxed
point of LBP is a local minimum of the Bethe free energy. It is thus interesting to ask which local

1

minima of the Bethe free energy are stable or unstable ﬁxed points of LBP. We answer this question
by elucidating the conditions of the local stability of LBP and the positive deﬁniteness of the Bethe
free energy in terms of the eigenvalues of a matrix  which appears in the graph zeta function.

Finally  we discuss the uniqueness of LBP ﬁxed point by developing a differential topological result
on the Bethe free energy. The result shows that the determinant of the Hessian at the ﬁxed points 
which appears in the formula of zeta function  must satisfy a strong constraint. As a consequence 
in addition to the known result on the one-cycle case  we show that the LBP ﬁxed point is unique
for any unattractive connected graph with two cycles without restricting the strength of interactions.

2 Loopy belief propagation algorithm and the Bethe free energy

Throughout this paper  G = (V  E) is a connected undirected graph with V the vertices and E the
undirected edges. The cardinality of V and E are denoted by N and M respectively.
In this article we focus on binary variables  i.e.  xi ∈ {±1}. Suppose that the probability distribution
over the set of variables x = (xi)i∈V is given by the following factorization form with respect to G:

graphs. If the graph is a tree  they are efﬁciently computed by Pearl’s belief propagation algorithm
[1]. Even if the graph has cycles  it is empirically known that the direct application of this algorithm 
called Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP)  often gives good approximation.
LBP is a message passing algorithm. For each directed edge  a message vector µi→j(xj) is assigned
and initialized arbitrarily. The update rule of messages is given by

We introduce the Bethe free energy as a tractable approximation of the Gibbs free energy. The
exact distribution (1) is characterized by a variational problem p(x) = argmin ^p FGibbs(^p)  where
the minimum is taken over all probability distributions on (xi)i∈V and FGibbs(^p) is the Gibbs free
energy deﬁned by FGibbs(^p) = KL(^p||p) − log Z. Here KL(^p||p) =
^p log(^p/p) is the Kullback-
Leibler divergence from ^p to p. Note that FGibbs(^p) is a convex function of ^p.
In the Bethe approximation  we conﬁne the above minimization to the distribution of the form
i∈V bi(xi)1−di   where di := |Ni| is the degree and the constraints
bij(xi  xj) > 0 
bij(xi  xj) = bi(xi) are satisﬁed. A set
{bi(xi)  bij(xi  xj)} satisfying these constraints is called pseudomarginals. For computational
tractability  we modify the Gibbs free energy to the objective function called Bethe free energy:

The domain of the objective function F is the set of pseudomarginals. The function F does not
necessarily have a unique minimum. The outcome of this modiﬁed variational problem is the same
as that of LBP [3]. To put it more precisely  There is a one-to-one correspondence between the set
of stationary points of the Bethe free energy and the set of ﬁxed points of LBP.
It is more convenient if we work with minimal parameters  mean mi = Ebi [xi] and correlation
χij = Ebij [xixj]. Then we have an effective parametrization of pseudomarginals:

matrix of size N + M and denoted by ∇2F . This is considered to be a matrix-valued function on

3 Zeta function and Hessian of Bethe free energy

3.1 Zeta function and Ihara’s formula

For each undirected edge of G  we make a pair of oppositely directed edges  which form a set of
directed edges ⃗E. Thus | ⃗E| = 2M. For each directed edge e ∈ ⃗E  o(e) ∈ V is the origin of e and
t(e) ∈ V is the terminus of e. For e ∈ ⃗E  the inverse edge is denoted by (cid:22)e  and the corresponding
undirected edge by [e] = [(cid:22)e] ∈ E.
A closed geodesic in G is a sequence (e1  . . .   ek) of directed edges such that t(ei) =
o(ei+1) and ei ̸= (cid:22)ei+1 for i ∈ Z/kZ. Two closed geodesics are said to be equivalent if one is
obtained by cyclic permutation of the other. An equivalent class of closed geodesics is called a
prime cycle if it is not a repeated concatenation of a shorter closed geodesic. Let P be the set of
prime cycles of G. For given weights u = (ue)e∈ ⃗E  the edge zeta function [7  8] is deﬁned by

ζG(u) :=

(1 − g(p))

−1 

g(p) := ue1

··· uek

for p = (e1  . . .   ek) 

where ue ∈ C is assumed to be sufﬁciently small for convergence. This is an analogue of the
Riemann zeta function which is represented by the product over all the prime numbers.
∏
Example 1. If G is a tree  which has no prime cycles  ζG(u) = 1. For 1-cycle graph CN of
length N  the prime cycles are (e1  e2  . . .   eN ) and ((cid:22)eN   (cid:22)eN−1  . . .   (cid:22)e1)  and thus ζCN (u) = (1 −

It is known that the edge zeta function has the following simple determinant formula  which gives
analytical continuation to the whole C2M . Let C( ⃗E) be the set of functions on the directed edges.
We deﬁne a matrix on C( ⃗E)  which is determined by the graph G  by

the paper.

4 Application to positive deﬁniteness conditions

The convexity of the Bethe free energy is an important issue  as it guarantees uniqueness of the ﬁxed
point. Pakzad et al [11] and Heskes [5] derive sufﬁcient conditions of convexity and show that the
Bethe free energy is convex for trees and graphs with one cycle. In this section  instead of such
global structure  we shall focus the local structure of the Bethe free energy as an application of the
main formula.
For given square matrix X  Spec(X) ⊂ C denotes the set of eigenvalues (spectra)  and ρ(X) the
spectral radius of a matrix X  i.e.  the maximum of the modulus of the eigenvalues.
Theorem 4. Let M be the matrix given by (7). For given {mi  χij} ∈ L(G)  U is deﬁned by (13).
Then 
Proof. We deﬁne mi(t) := mi and χij(t) := tχij + (1 − t)mimj. Then {mi(t)  χij(t)} ∈ L(G)
and {mi(1)  χij(1)} = {mi  χij}. For t ∈ [0  1]  we deﬁne U(t) and ∇2F (t) in the same way by
{mi(t)  χij(t)}. We see that U(t) = tU. Since Spec(UM) ⊂ C\R≥1  we have det(I−tUM) ̸= 0
t ∈ [0  1]. From theorem 3  det(∇2F (t)) ̸= 0 holds on this interval. Using (14) and χij(0) =
∀
mi(0)mj(0)  we can check that ∇2F (0) is positive deﬁnite. Since the eigenvalues of ∇2F (t) are
real and continuous with respect t  the eigenvalues of ∇2F (1) must be positive reals.

Spec(UM) ⊂ C \ R≥1 =⇒ ∇2F is a positive deﬁnite matrix at {mi  χij}.

We deﬁne the symmetrization of ui→j and uj→i by

−1 for all e ∈ ⃗E}. Then  the Hessian ∇2F is positive deﬁnite on Lα−1 (G).

Thus  ui→juj→i = βi→jβj→i. Since βi→j = βj→i  we sometimes abbreviate βi→j as βij. From
the ﬁnal expression  we see that |βij| < 1. Deﬁne diagonal matrices Z and B by (Z)e e′
:=
δe e′ (1 − m2
t(e))1/2 and (B)e e′ := δe e′βe respectively. Then we have ZUMZ−1 = BM  because
(ZUMZ−1)e e′ = (1 − m2
Therefore Spec(UM) = Spec(BM).
The following corollary gives a more explicit condition of the region where the Hessian is positive
deﬁnite in terms of the correlation coefﬁcients of the pseudomarginals.
Corollary 1. Let α be the Perron Frobenius eigenvalue of M and deﬁne Lα−1(G) := {{mi  χij} ∈
L(G)||βe| < α
Proof. Since |βe| < α
Spec(BM) ∩ R≥1 = ϕ.
−1 is the distance from the origin to the nearest pole of Ihara’s zeta ζG(u).
As is seen from (11)  α
From example 1  we see that ζG(u) = 1 for a tree G and ζCN (u) = (1 − uN )
−2 for a 1-cycle graph
−1 is ∞ and 1 respectively. In these cases  Lα−1(G) = L(G) and F is a strictly
CN . Therefore α
convex function on L(G)  because |βe| < 1 always holds. This reproduces the results shown in [11].
In general  using theorem 8.1.22 of [12]  we have mini∈V di − 1 ≤ α ≤ maxi∈V di − 1.
Theorem 3 is also useful to show non-convexity.
Corollary 2. Let {mi(t) := 0  χij(t) := t} ∈ L(G) for t < 1. Then we have

−1M) = 1 ([12] Theorem 8.1.18). Therefore

−1  we have ρ(BM) < ρ(α

lim
t→1

det(∇2F (t))(1 − t)M +N−1 = −2

−M−N +1(M − N )κ(G) 
where κ(G) is the number of spanning trees in G. In particular  F is never convex on L(G) for any
connected graph with at least two linearly independent cycles  i.e. M − N ≥ 1.
Proof. The equation (16) is obtained by Hashimoto’s theorem [13]  which gives the u → 1 limit
of the Ihara zeta function. (See supplementary material for the detail.) If M − N ≥ 1  the right
hand side of (16) is negative. As approaches to {mi = 0  χij = 1} ∈ L(G)  the determinant of the
Hessian diverges to −∞. Therefore the Hessian is not positive deﬁnite near the point.

(16)

Summarizing the results in this section  we conclude that F is convex on L(G) if and only if G is a
tree or a graph with one cycle. To the best of our knowledge  this is the ﬁrst proof of this fact.

5 Application to stability analysis

In this section we discuss the local stability of LBP and the local structure of the Bethe free energy
around a LBP ﬁxed point. Heskes [6] shows that a locally stable ﬁxed point of sufﬁciently damped
LBP is a local minima of the Bethe free energy. The converse is not necessarily true in general  and
we will elucidate the gap between these two properties.

First  we regard the LBP update as a dynamical system. Since the model is binary  each message
µi→j(xj) is parametrized by one parameter  say ηi→j. The state of LBP algorithm is expressed
∈ C( ⃗E)  and the update rule (2) is identiﬁed with a transform T on C( ⃗E) 
by (cid:17) = (ηe)e∈ ⃗E
(cid:17)new = T ((cid:17)). Then  the set of ﬁxed points of LBP is {(cid:17)
A ﬁxed point (cid:17)
con-
verges to (cid:17)
around the ﬁxed point. As is
discussed in [14]  (cid:17)
To suppress oscillatory behaviors of LBP  damping of update Tϵ := (1 − ϵ)T + ϵI is sometimes
useful  where 0 ≤ ϵ < 1 is a damping strength and I is the identity. A ﬁxed point is locally stable
with some damping if and only if Spec(T

There are many representations of the linearization (derivative) of LBP update (see [14  15])  we

that a ﬁxed point of LBP is a local minimum of the Bethe free energy if Spec(T
It is now clear that the condition for positive deﬁniteness  local stability of damped LBP and local
stability of undamped LBP are given in terms of the set of eigenvalues  C \ R≥1  {λ ∈ C|Reλ < 1}
and {λ ∈ C||λ| < 1} respectively. A locally stable ﬁxed point of sufﬁciently damped LBP is a
local minimum of the Bethe free energy  because {λ ∈ C|Reλ < 1} is included in C \ R≥1. This
reproduces Heskes’s result [6]. Moreover  we see the gap between the locally stable ﬁxed points
with some damping and the local minima of the Bethe free energy: if Spec(T
)) is included in
C \ R≥1 but not in {λ ∈ C|Reλ < 1}  the ﬁxed point is a local minimum of the Bethe free energy
though it is not a locally stable ﬁxed point of LBP with any damping.

It is interesting to ask under which condition a local minimum of the Bethe free energy is a stable
ﬁxed point of (damped) LBP. While we do not know a complete answer  for an attractive model 
which is deﬁned by Jij ≥ 0  the following theorem implies that if a stable ﬁxed point becomes
unstable by changing Jij and hi  the corresponding local minimum also disappears.
Theorem 6. Let us consider continuously parametrized attractive models {ψij(t)  ψi(t)}  e.g. t
−1hixi). For given t  run LBP
is a temperature: ψij(t) = exp(t
algorithm and ﬁnd a (stable) ﬁxed point. If we continuously change t and see the LBP ﬁxed point
becomes unstable across t = t0  then the corresponding local minimum of the Bethe free energy
becomes a saddle point across t = t0.
Proof. From (3)  we see bij(xi  xj) ∝ exp(Jijxixj + θixi + θjxj) for some θi and θj. From
Jij ≥ 0  we have Covbij [xi  xj] = χij − mimj ≥ 0  and thus ui→j ≥ 0. When the LBP ﬁxed point
becomes unstable  the Perron Frobenius eigenvalue of UM goes over 1  which means det(I −UM)
crosses 0. From theorem 3 we see that det(∇2F ) becomes positive to negative at t = t0.

6 Application to uniqueness of LBP ﬁxed point

The uniqueness of LBP ﬁxed point is a concern of many studies  because the property guarantees that
LBP ﬁnds the global minimum of the Bethe free energy if it converges. The major approaches to the
uniqueness is to consider equivalent minimax problem [5]  contraction property of LBP dynamics
[17  18]  and to use the theory of Gibbs measure [19]. We will propose a different  differential
topological approach to this problem.

In our approach  in combination with theorem 3  the following theorem is the basic apparatus.
Theorem 7. If det∇2F (q) ̸= 0 for all q ∈ (∇F )

We call each summand  which is +1 or −1  the index of F at q.
Note that the set (∇F )
−1(0)  which is the stationary points of the Bethe free energy  coincides with
the ﬁxed points of LBP. The above theorem asserts that the sum of indexes of all the ﬁxed points
must be one. As a consequence  the number of the ﬁxed points of LBP is always odd. Note also that
the index is a local quantity  while the assertion expresses the global structure of the function F .

For the proof of theorem 7  we prepare two lemmas. The proof of lemma 1 is shown in the supple-
mentary material. Lemma 2 is a standard result in differential topology  and we refer [20] theorem
13.1.2 and comments in p.104 for the proof.
Lemma 1. If a sequence {qn} ⊂ L(G) converges to a point q∗ ∈ ∂L(G)  then ∥∇F (qn)∥ → ∞ 
where ∂L(G) is the boundary of L(G) ⊂ RN +M .

Lemma 2. Let M1 and M2 be compact  connected and orientable manifolds with boundaries.
Assume that the dimensions of M1 and M2 are the same. Let f : M1 → M2 be a smooth map
satisfying f (∂M1) ⊂ ∂M2. For a regular value of p ∈ M2  i.e. det(∇f (q)) ̸= 0 for all q ∈ f

q∈f−1(p) sgn(det∇f (q)). Then deg f does not

If we can guarantee that the index of every ﬁxed point is +1 in advance of running LBP  we conclude
that ﬁxed point of LBP is unique. We have the following a priori information for β.
Lemma 3. Let βij be given by (15) at any ﬁxed point of LBP. Then |βij| ≤ tanh(|Jij|) and
sgn(βij) = sgn(Jij) hold.
Proof. From (3)  we see that bij(xi  xj) ∝ exp(Jijxixj + θixi + θjxj) for some θi and
θj. With (15) and straightforward computation  we obtain βij = sinh(2Jij)(cosh(2θi) +
cosh(2Jij))

−1/2. The bound is attained when θi = 0 and θj = 0.

−1/2(cosh(2θj)+cosh(2Jij))

From theorem 7 and lemma 3  we can immediately obtain the uniqueness condition in [18]  though
the stronger contractive property is proved under the same condition in [18].

Corollary 3 ([18]). If ρ(J M) < 1  then the ﬁxed point of LBP is unique  where J is a diagonal
matrix deﬁned by Je e′ = tanh(|Je|)δe e′.
Proof. Since |βij| ≤ tanh(|Jij|)  we have ρ(BM) ≤ ρ(J M) < 1. ([12] Theorem 8.1.18.) Then
det(I − BM) = det(I − UM) > 0 implies that the index of any LBP ﬁxed point must be +1.

In the proof of the above corollary  we only used the bound of modulus. In the following case of
corollary 4  we can utilize the information of signs. To state the corollary  we need a terminology.
The interactions {Jij  hi} and {J
} are said to be equivalent if there exists (si) ∈ {±1}V such
′
i = hisi. Since an equivalent model is obtained by gauge transformation
that J
xi → xisi  the uniqueness property of LBP for equivalent models is unchanged.
Corollary 4. If the number of linearly independent cycle of G is two (i.e. M − N + 1 = 2)  and the
interaction is not equivalent to attractive model  then the LBP ﬁxed point is unique.

The proof is shown in the supplementary material. We give an example to illustrate the outline.
Example 2. Let V := {1  2  3  4} and E := {12  13  14  23  34}. The interactions are given by
arbitrary {hi} and {−J12  J13  J14  J23  J34} with Jij ≥ 0. See ﬁgure 1. It is enough to check that
det(I − BM) > 0 for arbitrary 0 ≤ β13  β23  β14  β34 < 1 and −1 < β12 ≤ 0. Since the prime
cycles of G bijectively correspond to those of ^G (in ﬁgure 2)  we have det(I−BM) = det(I− ^B ^M) 
where ^βe1 = β12β23  ^βe2 = β13  and ^βe3 = β34. We see that det(I − ^B ^M) = (1 − ^βe1
−
^βe3) > 0. In other cases 
^βe1
we can reduce to the graph ^G or the graphs in ﬁgure 3 similarly (see the supplementary material).

For attractive models  the ﬁxed point of the LBP is not necessarily unique.
For graphs with multiple cycles  all the existing results on uniqueness make assumptions that up-
perbound |Jij| essentially. In contrast  corollary 4 applies to arbitrary strength of interactions if the
graph has two cycles and the interactions are not attractive. It is noteworthy that  from corollary 2 
the Bethe free energy is non-convex in the situation of corollary 4  while the ﬁxed point is unique.

7 Concluding remarks

For binary pairwise models  we show the connection between the edge zeta function and the Bethe
free energy in theorem 3  in the proof of which the multi-variable version of Ihara’s formula (theorem
2) is essential. After the initial submission of this paper  we found that theorem 3 is extended to a
more general class of models including multinomial models and Gaussian models represented by
arbitrary factor graphs. We will discuss the extended formula and its applications in a future paper.

Some recent researches on LBP have suggested the importance of zeta function. In the context of the
LDPC code  which is an important application of LBP  Koetter et al [21  22] show the connection
between pseudo-codewords and the edge zeta function. On the LBP for the Gaussian graphical
model  Johnson et al [23] give zeta-like product formula of the partition function. While these are
not directly related to our work  pursuing covered connections is an interesting future research topic.
