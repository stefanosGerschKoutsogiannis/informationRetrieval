Abstract

The odor transduction process has a large time constant and is susceptible to vari-
ous types of noise. Therefore  the olfactory code at the sensor/receptor level is in
general a slow and highly variable indicator of the input odor in both natural and
artiﬁcial situations. Insects overcome this problem by using a neuronal device in
their Antennal Lobe (AL)  which transforms the identity code of olfactory recep-
tors to a spatio-temporal code. This transformation improves the decision of the
Mushroom Bodies (MBs)  the subsequent classiﬁer  in both speed and accuracy.
Here we propose a rate model based on two intrinsic mechanisms in the insect AL 
namely integration and inhibition. Then we present a MB classiﬁer model that re-
sembles the sparse and random structure of insect MB. A local Hebbian learning
procedure governs the plasticity in the model. These formulations not only help to
understand the signal conditioning and classiﬁcation methods of insect olfactory
systems  but also can be leveraged in synthetic problems. Among them  we con-
sider here the discrimination of odor mixtures from pure odors. We show on a set
of records from metal-oxide gas sensors that the cascade of these two new mod-
els facilitates fast and accurate discrimination of even highly imbalanced mixtures
from pure odors.

1 Introduction

Odor sensors are diverse in terms of their sensitivity to odor identity and concentrations. When
arranged in parallel arrays  they may provide a rich representation of the odor space. Biological
olfactory systems owe the bulk of their success to employing a large number of olfactory receptor
neurons (ORNs) of various phenotypes. However  chemo-diversity comes at the expense of two
pressing factors  namely response time and reproducibility  while fast and accurate processing of
chemo-sensory information is vital for survival not only in natural  but also in many artiﬁcial situa-
tions  including security applications.

Identifying and quantifying an odor accurately in a short time is an impressive characteristic of
insect olfaction. Given that there are approximately tens of thousands of ORNs sending slow and
noisy messages in parallel to downstream olfactory layers  in order to account for the observed
recognition performance  a computationally non-trivial process must be taking place along the insect
olfactory pathway following the transduction. The two stations responsible for this processing are
the Antennal Lobe (AL) and the Mushroom Bodies (MBs). The former acts as a signal conditioning
/ feature extraction device and the latter as an algebraic classiﬁer.

Our motivation in this study is the potential for skillful feature extraction and classiﬁcation methods
by insect olfactory systems in synthetic applications  which also deal with slow and noisy sensory
data. The particular problem we address is the discrimination of two-component odor mixtures from

pure odors in a three-class classiﬁcation setting. The problem is nontrivial when concentrations of
mixture components are imbalanced. It becomes particularly challenging when the overall mixture
concentration is small. We treat the problem on two mixture datasets recorded from metal-oxide gas
sensors (included in the supplementary material).

We propose in the next section a dynamical rate model mimicking the AL’s signal conditioning
function. By testing the model ﬁrst with a generic Support Vector Machine (SVM) classiﬁer  we
validate the substantial improvement that AL adds on the classiﬁcatory value of raw sensory signal
(Section 2). Then  we introduce a MB-like classiﬁer to substitute for the SVM and complete the
biomimetic framework  as outlined in Fig. 1. The model MB exploits the structural organization of
the insect MB. Its plasticity is adjusted by a local Hebbian learning procedure  which is gated by a
binary learning signal (Section 3). Some concluding remarks are given in Section 4.

Insect Antennal Lobe Outline

2 The Antennal Lobe
2.1
The Antennal Lobe is a spatio-temporal encoder for ORN signals that include time in coding space.
Some of its qualitative properties are apparent from the input-output perspective  without requiring
much insight into its physiology. A direct analysis of spiking rates in raw ORN responses and in
the AL output [1] shows that in fruit ﬂy AL maps ORN output to a low dimensional feature space
while providing lower variability in responses to the same odor type (reducing within-class scatter)
and longer average distance between responses for different odors (boosting between-class scatter).
These observations constitute sufﬁcient evidence that a realistic AL model should be sought within
the class of nonlinear ﬁlters.

Another remarkable achievement of the AL shows itself in terms of recognition time. When sub-
jected to a constant odor concentration  the settling time of ORN activity is on the order of hundreds
of milliseconds to seconds [3]  whereas recognition is known to occur earlier [7]. This is a clear
indicator that the AL makes extensive use of the ORN transient  since instantaneous activity is less
odor-speciﬁc in transient than it is in during the steady state. To provide high accuracy under such a
temporal constraint  the classiﬁcatory information during this period must be somehow accumulated 
which means that AL has to be a dynamical system  utilizing memory.

It is the cooperation of these ﬁltering and memory mechanisms in the AL that expedites and consol-
idates the decision made in the subsequent classiﬁer.

Strong experimental evidence suggests that the insect AL representation of odors is a transient 
yet reproducible  spatio-temporal encoding [8]. The AL is a dynamical network that is formed by
the coupling of an excitatory neuron population (projection neurons  PNs) with an inhibitory one

2

(local neurons  LNs). It receives input from glomeruli  junctions of synapses that group the ORNs
according to the receptor gene they express. The fruit ﬂy has about 50 glomeruli as chemotopic
clusters of synapses from nearly 50  000 ORNs. There is no consensus on the functional role of this
convergence beyond serving as an input terminal to AL  which is certainly an active processing layer.
In the analogy we are building here (c.f. Fig. 1)  the 16 artiﬁcial gas sensors actually correspond to
glomeruli (rather than individual ORNs) so that the AL has direct access to sensor resistances.

We suggest that the two key principles underlying the AL’s information processing are decorrelation
(ﬁltering) and integration (memory)  which can be uniﬁed on a dynamical system. The ﬁlter property
provides selectivity  while the integrator accumulates the reﬁned information on trajectories. This
setting is capable of evaluating the transient portion of the sensory signal effectively.

An instantaneous value read from a receptor early in the transduction process is considered as im-
mature  failing to convey a consistently high classiﬁcatory value by its own. Nevertheless  the ORN
transient as an interval indeed offers unique features to expedite the classiﬁcation. In particular 
the novelty gained due to observing consecutive samples during the transient is on average greater
than the informational gain obtained during the steady-state. Hence  newly observed samples of the
receptor transients are likely to contribute to the cumulative classiﬁcatory information base formed
so far  whereas the informational entropy vanishes as the signal reaches the steady-state. As a device
that extracts and integrates odor-speciﬁc information in ORN signals  the AL provides an enriched
transient to the subsequent MB so that it can achieve accurate classiﬁcation early in the odor period.

We also note that there have been efforts  e.g.  [9  10] to illustrate the sharpening effect of inhibition
in the olfactory system. However  to the best of our knowledge  the approach we present here is the
ﬁrst to formulate the temporal gain due to AL processing.
2.2 The Model
The model AL is comprised of a population of PNs that project from the AL to downstream pro-
cessing. The neural activity corresponding to the rate of action potential generation of the biological
neurons is given by xi(t)  i = 1  2  ...  NE  for the NE neurons in the PN population. There are also
NI interneurons or LNs whose activity is yi(t); i = 1  2  ...  NI.
The rate of change in these activities is stimulated by a weighted sum over both populations and a
set of input signals SE
i (t) indicating the activity in the glomeruli stimulating the PNs and
the LNs  respectively. In addition  each population receives noise from the AL environment. Our
formulation of these ideas is through a Wilson-Cowan-like population model [11]

resistance time series. This sensor is assigned randomly among all 16 available sensors  ensuring
that all sensors are covered1.

with λK = 7.5 and λβ = 0.5  respectively. Following construction  the initial condition of each
unit is taken as zero and µ is taken as a white noise process with variance 10−4 independently
for each unit. We perform the simulation of the 150-dimensional Wilson-Cowan dynamics by 5/6
Runge-Kutta integration with variable step size where the error tolerance is set to 10−15.
Although the considered network structure can accommodate limit cycles and strange attractors  the
selected range of parameters yield a ﬁxed point behavior. We conﬁrm this in all simulations with the
selected parameter values  both during and after the sensory input (odor) period (see Fig. 2(b)).
2.3 Validation
We consider the activity in PN population as the only piece of information regarding the input odor
that is passed on to higher-order layers of the olfactory system. Access to this activity by those
layers can be modeled as instantaneous sampling of a selected brief window of temporal behavior
of PNs [7]. Therefore  the recognition system in our model utilizes such snapshots from the spiking
activity in the excitatory population xi(t). A snapshot is passed as the feature vector to the classiﬁer;
it is comprised of an NE-dimensional ﬁxed vector taken as a sample from the states x1  . . .   xNE at
a particular time ts.
2.3.1 Dataset
The model is driven by responses recorded from 16 metal-oxide gas sensors in parallel. We have
made 80 recordings and grouped them into two sets based on vapor concentration: records for
100ppm vapor in Dataset 1 and 50ppm in Dataset 2. Each dataset contains 40 records from three
classes: 10 pure acetaldehyde  10 pure toluene  and 20 mixture records. The mixture class con-
tains records from imbalanced acetaldehyde-toluene mixtures with 96%-4%  98%-2%  2%-98% 
and 4%-96% partial concentrations  ﬁve from each. Hence  we have two instances of the mixture
identiﬁcation problem in the form of three-class classiﬁcation. See the supplementary material for
details on measurement process.

We removed the offset from each sensor record and scaled the odor period to 1s. This was done
by mapping the odor period  which has ﬁxed length of 100s in the original records  to 1s by re-
indexing the time series. These one-second long raw time series  included in the supplementary
material  constitute the pool of raw inputs to be applied to the AL network during the time interval
0.5 ≤ t ≤ 1.5s. The input is set to zero outside of this odor period. See Fig. 2 for a sample record
and the AL network’s response to it. Note that  although we apply the network to pre-recorded data
in simulations  the general scheme is causal  thus can be applied in real-time.

2.3.2 Adjustment of AL Network and Performance Evaluation
To reveal the signal conditioning performance of the stand-alone AL model  we ﬁrst interface it
with an established classiﬁer. We use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classiﬁer with linear kernel
to map the snapshots from PN activity to odor identity. This choice is due to the parameter-free
design that rules out the possibility of over-ﬁtting. The classiﬁer is realized by the publicly available
software LibSVM [2].

Due to the wide diversity of PNs and LNs in terms of their time scales β and gains K  the perfor-
mance of the network is highly sensitive to the agreement between the outcome of the generative
process and the choice of parameters gE and gI. Therefore  it is not possible to give a one-size-
ﬁts-all value for these. Instead  we have generated one sample network topology via the Bernoulli
process described above and customized gE and gI for it on each problem. For reproducibility  this
topology is provided in the supplementary material. Comparable results can be obtained with other
topologies but possibly with different gE  gI values than the ones reported below.
The validation is carried out in the following way: First we set the classiﬁcation problem (i.e. 
select Dataset 1 or 2) and ﬁx gE = gI = 0 (suppress the connectivity). We present each record
in the dataset to the network and then log the network response from excitatory population in the
form of NE simultaneous time series (see Fig. 2). Then  at each percentile of the odor period
k=0  we take a snapshot from each NE-dimensional time series and label it
ts ∈ {0.5 + k/100}100
by the odor identity (pure acetaldehyde  pure toluene  or mixture). We use randomly selected 80%
of the resulting data in training the SVM classiﬁer and keep the remaining 20% for testing it. We
record the rate of correct classiﬁcation on the test data. The train-test stage is repeated 1000 times
with different random splits of labelled data. The average correct classiﬁcation rate is assigned as
the performance of the AL model at that ts. The classiﬁcation proﬁle versus time is extracted when
the ts sweep through the odor period is complete.
To maximize the performance over conductances gE and gI  we further perform a sweep through
a range of these parameters by repeating the above procedure for each combination of gE  gI. Fig-

5

ure 3 (a) shows the classiﬁcation proﬁle for the best pair encountered along the parameter sweep
k=0. This pair is determined as the one maximizing classiﬁcation success rate
gE  gI ∈ {k/100}100
when samples from the end of odor period is used ts = 1.5. Note that these optimum values are
problem-speciﬁc. For the two instances considered in this work  we mark them by the peaks of the
surfaces in Fig. 3 (b) and (d).

Dataset 1 induces an easier instance of the identiﬁcation problem toward the end of odor period 
which can be resolved reasonably well using raw sensor data at the steady state. Therefore  the gain
over baseline due to AL processing is not so signiﬁcant in later portions of the odor period for Dataset
1. Also observe from panels (b) and (d) that  when dealing with Dataset 1  the conductance values are
less decisive than they are for Dataset 2. Again  this is because the former is an easier problem when
the sensors reach the steady-state at ts = 1.5s  where almost all conductance within the swept range
ensures > 95% performance. The relative difﬁculty of the problem in Dataset 2 manifests itself as
the ﬂuctuations in the baseline performance. We see in Fig. 3(c) that there are actually periods early
in the period where the raw sensor data can be fairly indicative of the class information; however  it
is not possible to predict these intervals in advance. It should also be noted that some of these peaks
in baseline performance  at least the very ﬁrst one near ts = 0.55s  are artifacts (due to classiﬁcation
of pure noise) since we know that there is hardly any vapor in the measurement chamber during that
period (see Fig. 2(a) and other records in supplementary material). In any case  in both problems 
the suggested AL dynamics (with adjusted parameters) contributes substantially to the classiﬁcation
performance during the transient of the sensory signal. This makes early decisions of the classiﬁer
substantially and consistently more accurate with respect to the baseline classiﬁcation.

Having established the contribution of the AL network to classiﬁcation  our goal in the remainder
of the paper is to replace the unbiased SVM classiﬁer by a biologically plausible MB model  while
preserving the performance gain seen in Fig. 3.
3 Mushroom Body Classiﬁer
The MBs of insects employ a large number of identical small intrinsic cells  the so-called Kenyon
cells  and fewer output neurons in the MB lobes. It has been observed that  unlike in the AL  the
activity in the KCs is very sparse  both across the population and for individual cells over time. The-
oretical work suggests that a large number of cells with sparse activity enables efﬁcient classiﬁcation
with random connectivity [4]. The power of this architecture lies in its versatility: The connectivity
is not optimized for any speciﬁc task and can  therefore  accommodate a variety of input types.
3.1 The Model
The insect MB consists of four crucial elements (see Fig. 4): i) a nonlinear expansion from the
AL representation at the ﬁnal stage  x  that resembles the connectivity from the Antennal Lobe to
the MBs  ii) a gain control in the MB to achieve a uniform level of sparse activity the KCs  y  iii)
a classiﬁcation phase  where the connections from the KCs to the output neurons  z  are modiﬁed
according to a Hebbian learning rule  and iv) a learning signal that determines when and which
output neuron’s synapses are reinforced.

It has been shown in locusts that the activity patterns in the AL are practically discretized by a
periodic feedforward inhibition onto the MB calyces and that the activity levels in KCs are very
low [7]. Based on the observed discrete and sparse activity pattern in insect MB  we choose to
represent KC units as simple algebraic McCulloch-Pitts ‘neurons.’ The neural activity values taken

i=1 cjixi − θKC(cid:17) j =

by this neural model are binary (0 = no spike and 1 = spike): µj = Φ(cid:16)PNE

1  2  ...  NKC. The vector x is the representation of the odor that is received as a snapshot from the
excitatory PN units of AL model. The components of the vector x = (x1  x2  ...  xNE ) are the direct
values obtained by integration of the ODE of the AL model described above. The KC layer vector µ
is NKC dimensional. cij ∈ {0  1} are the components of the connectivity matrix which is NE ×NKC
in size. The ﬁring threshold θKC is integer number and Φ(·) is the Heaviside function.
The connectivity matrix [cji] is determined randomly by an independent Bernoulli process. Since
the degree of connectivity from the input neurons to the KC neurons did not appear to be critical for
the performance of the system  we made it uniform by setting the connection probability as pc = 0.1.
It  nevertheless  seems advisable to ensure in the construction that the input-to-KC layer mapping is
bijective to avoid loss of information. We performed this check during network construction. All
other parameters of the KC layer are then assigned admissible values uniformly randomly and ﬁxed.

Although the basic system described so far implements the divergent (and static) input layer ob-
served in insect calyx  it is very unstable against ﬂuctuations in the total number of active input
neurons due to the divergence of connectivity. This is an obstacle for inducing sparse activity at KC
level. One mechanism suggested to remove this instability is gain control by feedforward inhibition.
For our purposes  we impose a number nKC of simultaneously active KCs  and admit the ﬁring of
only the top nKC = NKC/5 neurons that receive the most excitation in the ﬁrst layer.
The fan-in stage of projections from the KCs to the extrinsic MB cells in the MB lobes is the
hypothesized locus of learning. In our model  the output units in the MB lobes are again McCulloch-
l = 1  2  ...  NLB. Here  the index LB denotes the
MB lobes. The output vector z of the MB lobes has dimension NLB (equals 3 in our problem) and
θLB is the threshold for the decision neurons in the MB lobes. The NLB × NKC connectivity matrix
wlj has integer entries. Similar to the above-mentioned gain control  we allow only the decision
neuron that receives the highest synaptic input to ﬁre. These synaptic strengths wlj are subject to
changes during learning according to a Hebbian type plasticity rule described next.
3.2 Training
The hypothesis of locating reinforcement learning in mushroom bodies goes back to Montague and
collaborators [6]. Every odor class is associated with an output neuron of the MB  so there are three
output nodes ﬁring for either pure toluene  pure acetaldehyde  or mixture type of input. The plas-
ticity rule is applied on the connectivity matrix W   whose entries are randomly and independently
initialized within [0  10]. The exact initial distribution of weights have no signiﬁcant impact on the
resulting performance nor on the learning speed.

ℓ

During learning  the inputs are presented to the system in an arbitrary order. The entries of the
connectivity matrix at the time of the nth input are denoted by wlj(n). When the next training input
with label ℓ is applied  then the weight wℓj is updated by the rule wℓj(n + 1) = H (zℓ  µj  wℓj(n)) 
where H(z  µ  w) = w + 1 when z = 1  µ = 1; and 0  otherwise. This learning rule strenghtens
a synaptic connection with probability p+ if presynaptic activity is accompanied by postsynaptic
activity. To facilitate learning during the training phase  the ‘correct’ output neuron ℓ is forced to
ﬁre for an input with label ℓ  while the rest are kept silent. This is provided by pulling down the
threshold θLB
  unless neuron ℓ is already ﬁring for such input. Learning is terminated when the
performance (correct classiﬁcation rate) converges.
3.3 Validation
Using Dataset 2  we applied the proposed MB model with NKC = 10  000 KCs at the output of
the sample AL topology having the same parameters reported in Section 2. For p+ = p− = 1 
we trained the output layer of MB using the labelled AL outputs sampled at 10 points in the odor
period. The mean correct classiﬁcation rate over 20 splits of the labelled snapshots (ﬁve-fold cross-
validation) are shown in Fig.3(c) as blue dots. With respect to the red curve on the same panel  which
was obtained by the (maximum-margin) SVM classiﬁer  a slight reduction in the generalization
capability is visible. Nevertheless  the MB classiﬁer in its current form still exploits the superior
job of AL over baseline classiﬁcation during transient  while mimicking two essential features of
the biological MB  namely sparsity in KC-layer and incremental local learning in MB lobes. The
implementation details and parameters of the MB model are provided in the supplementary material.

4 Conclusions
We have presented a complete odor identiﬁcation scheme based on the key principles of insect
olfaction  and demonstrated its validity in discriminating mixtures of odors from pure odors using
actual records from metal-oxide gas sensors.

The bulk of the observed performance is due to the AL  which is a dynamical feature extractor for
slow and noisy chemo-sensory time series. The cooperation of integration (accumulation) mecha-
nism and sharpening ﬁlter enabled by inhibition leave an almost linearly separable problem for the
subsequent classiﬁer. The proposed signal conditioning scheme can be considered as a mathematical
image of reservior computing [5]. For this simpliﬁed classiﬁcation task  we have also suggested a
bio-inspired MB classiﬁer with local Hebbian plasticity. By exploiting the dynamical nature of the
AL stage and the sparsity in MB representation  the overall model provides an explanation for the
high speed and accuracy of odor identiﬁcation in insect olfactory processing.

For future study  we envision an improvement on the MB classiﬁcation performance  which has been
explored here to be slightly worse than linear SVM. We think that this can be done without compro-
mising biological plausibility  by imposing mild constraints on the KC-level generative process.

The mixture identiﬁcation problem investigated here is in general more difﬁcult than the traditional
problem of discriminating pure odors  since the mixture class can be made arbitrarily close to the
pure odor classes. The classiﬁcation performance attained here is promising for other mixture-
related problems that are among the hardest in the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial olfaction.
