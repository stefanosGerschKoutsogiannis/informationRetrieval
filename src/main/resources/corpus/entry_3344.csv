Abstract

3D object reconstruction from a single image is a highly under-determined prob-
lem  requiring strong prior knowledge of plausible 3D shapes. This introduces
challenges for learning-based approaches  as 3D object annotations are scarce in
real images. Previous work chose to train on synthetic data with ground truth 3D
information  but suffered from domain adaptation when tested on real data.
In this work  we propose MarrNet  an end-to-end trainable model that sequentially
estimates 2.5D sketches and 3D object shape. Our disentangled  two-step formula-
tion has three advantages. First  compared to full 3D shape  2.5D sketches are much
easier to be recovered from a 2D image; models that recover 2.5D sketches are also
more likely to transfer from synthetic to real data. Second  for 3D reconstruction
from 2.5D sketches  systems can learn purely from synthetic data. This is because
we can easily render realistic 2.5D sketches without modeling object appearance
variations in real images  including lighting  texture  etc. This further relieves the
domain adaptation problem. Third  we derive differentiable projective functions
from 3D shape to 2.5D sketches; the framework is therefore end-to-end trainable on
real images  requiring no human annotations. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance on 3D shape reconstruction.

Introduction

Humans quickly recognize 3D shapes from a single image. Figure 1a shows a number of images
of chairs; despite their drastic difference in object texture  material  environment lighting  and
background  humans easily recognize they have very similar 3D shapes. What is the most essential
information that makes this happen?
Researchers in human perception argued that our 3D perception could rely on recovering 2.5D
sketches [Marr  1982]  which include intrinsic images [Barrow and Tenenbaum  1978  Tappen et al. 
2003] like depth and surface normal maps (Figure 1b). Intrinsic images disentangle object appearance
variations in texture  albedo  lighting  etc.  with its shape  which retains all information from the
observed image for 3D reconstruction. Humans further combine 2.5D sketches and a shape prior
learned from past experience to reconstruct a full 3D shape (Figure 1c). In the ﬁeld of computer
vision  there have also been abundant works exploiting the idea for reconstruction 3D shapes of
faces [Kemelmacher-Shlizerman and Basri  2011]  objects [Tappen et al.  2003]  and scenes [Hoiem
et al.  2005  Saxena et al.  2009].
Recently  researchers attempted to tackle the problem of single-image 3D reconstruction with deep
learning. These approaches usually regress a 3D shape from a single RGB image directly [Tulsiani
et al.  2017  Choy et al.  2016  Wu et al.  2016b]. In contrast  we propose a two-step while end-to-end
trainable pipeline  sequentially recovering 2.5D sketches (depth and normal maps) and a 3D shape.

Figure 1: Objects in real images (a) are subject to appearance variations regarding color  texture 
lighting  material  background  etc. Despite this  their 2.5D sketches like surface normal and depth
maps remain constant (b). The 2.5D sketches can be seen as an abstraction of the image  retaining all
information about the 3D shape of the object inside. We combine the sketches with learned shape
priors to reconstruct the full 3D shape (c).

We use an encoder-decoder structure for each component of the framework  and also enforce the
reprojection consistency between the estimated sketch and the 3D shape. We name it MarrNet  for its
close resemblance to David Marr’s theory of perception [Marr  1982].
Our approach offers several unique advantages. First  the use of 2.5D sketches releases the burden on
domain transfer. As single-image 3D reconstruction is a highly under-constrained problem  strong
prior knowledge of object shapes is needed. This poses challenges to learning-based methods  as
accurate 3D object annotations in real images are rare. Most previous methods turned to training
purely on synthetic data [Tulsiani et al.  2017  Choy et al.  2016  Girdhar et al.  2016]. However  these
approaches often suffer from the domain adaption issue due to imperfect rendering. Learning 2.5D
sketches from images  in comparison  is much easier and more robust to transfer from synthetic to
real images  as shown in Section 4.
Further  as our second step recovers 3D shape from 2.5D sketches — an abstraction of the raw input
image  it can be trained purely relying on synthetic data. Though rendering diverse realistic images is
challenging  it is straightforward to obtain almost perfect object surface normals and depths from a
graphics engine. This further relieves the domain adaptation issue.
We also enforce differentiable constraints between 2.5D sketches and 3D shape  making our system
end-to-end trainable  even on real images without any annotations. Given a set of unlabeled images 
our algorithm  pre-trained on synthetic data  can infer the 2.5D sketches of objects in the image 
and use it to reﬁne its estimation of objects’ 3D shape. This self-supervised feature enhances its
performance on images from different domains.
We evaluate our framework on both synthetic images of objects from ShapeNet [Chang et al.  2015] 
and real images from the PASCAL 3D+ dataset [Xiang et al.  2014]. We demonstrate that our
framework performs well on 3D shape reconstruction  both qualitatively and quantitatively.
Our contributions are three-fold: inspired by visual cognition theory  we propose a two-step  dis-
entangled formulation for single-image 3D reconstruction via 2.5D sketches; we develop a novel 
end-to-end trainable model with a differentiable projection layer that ensures consistency between
3D shape and mid-level representations; we demonstrate its effectiveness on 2.5D sketch transfer and
3D shape reconstruction on both synthetic and real data.

2 Related Work

2.5D Sketch Recovery Estimating 2.5D sketches has been a long-standing problem in computer
vision. In the past  researchers have explored recovering 2.5D shape from shading  texture  or color
images [Horn and Brooks  1989  Zhang et al.  1999  Tappen et al.  2003  Barron and Malik  2015 
Weiss  2001  Bell et al.  2014]. With the development of depth sensors [Izadi et al.  2011] and larger
scale RGB-D datasets [Silberman et al.  2012  Song et al.  2017  McCormac et al.  2017]  there
have also been papers on estimating depth [Chen et al.  2016  Eigen and Fergus  2015]  surface
normals [Bansal and Russell  2016  Wang et al.  2015]  and other intrinsic images [Shi et al.  2017

Janner et al.  2017] with deep networks. Our method employs 2.5D estimation as a component  but
targets reconstructing full 3D shape of an object.

Single-Image 3D Reconstruction The problem of recovering object shape from a single image
is challenging  as it requires both powerful recognition systems and prior shape knowledge. With
the development of large-scale shape repository like ShapeNet [Chang et al.  2015]  researchers
developed models encoding shape prior for this task [Girdhar et al.  2016  Choy et al.  2016  Tulsiani
et al.  2017  Wu et al.  2016b  Kar et al.  2015  Kanazawa et al.  2016  Soltani et al.  2017]  with
extension to scenes [Song et al.  2017]. These methods typically regress a voxelized 3D shape
directly from an input image  and rely on synthetic data or 2D masks for training. In comparison  our
formulation tackles domain difference better  as it can be end-to-end ﬁne-tuned on images without
any annotations.

2D-3D Consistency It is intuitive and practically helpful to constrain the reconstructed 3D shape
to be consistent with 2D observations. Researchers have explored this idea for decades [Lowe  1987].
This idea is also widely used in 3D shape completion from depths or silhouettes [Firman et al. 
2016  Rock et al.  2015  Dai et al.  2017]. Recently  a few papers discussed enforcing differentiable
2D-3D constraints between shape and silhouettes  enabling joint training of deep networks for 3D
reconstruction [Wu et al.  2016a  Yan et al.  2016  Rezende et al.  2016  Tulsiani et al.  2017]. In our
paper  we exploit this idea to develop differentiable constraints on the consistency between various
2.5D sketches and 3D shape.

3 Approach

To recover the 3D structure from a single view RGB image  our MarrNet contains three parts: ﬁrst  a
2.5D sketch estimator  which predicts the depth  surface normal  and silhouette images of the object
(Figure 2a); second  a 3D shape estimator  which infers 3D object shape using a voxel representation
(Figure 2b); third  a reprojection consistency function  enforcing the alignment between the estimated
3D structure and inferred 2.5D sketches (Figure 2c).

3.1

2.5D Sketch Estimation

The ﬁrst component of our network (Figure 2a) takes a 2D RGB image as input  and predicts its 2.5D
sketch: surface normal  depth  and silhouette. The goal of the 2.5D sketch estimation step is to distill
intrinsic object properties from input images  while discarding properties that are non-essential for
the task of 3D reconstruction  such as object texture and lighting.
We use an encoder-decoder network architecture for 2.5D sketch estimation. Our encoder is a
ResNet-18 [He et al.  2015]  encoding a 256×256 RGB image into 512 feature maps of size 8×8.

criteria for depths and silhouettes; right: the criterion for surface normals. See Section 3.3 for details.

The decoder contains four sets of 5×5 fully convolutional and ReLU layers  followed by four sets
of 1×1 convolutional and ReLU layers. It outputs the corresponding depth  surface normal  and
silhouette images  also at the resolution of 256×256.

3.2

3D Shape Estimation

The second part of our framework (Figure 2b) infers 3D object shape from estimated 2.5D sketches.
Here  the network focuses on learning the shape prior that explains input well. As it takes only surface
normal and depth images as input  it can be trained on synthetic data  without suffering from the
domain adaption problem: it is straightforward to render nearly perfect 2.5D sketches  but much
harder to render realistic images.
The network architecture is inspired by the TL network [Girdhar et al.  2016]  and the 3D-VAE-
GAN [Wu et al.  2016b]  again with an encoding-decoding style. It takes a normal image and a depth
image as input (both masked by the estimated silhouette)  maps them to a 200-dim vector via ﬁve sets
of convolutional  ReLU  and pooling layers  followed by two fully connected layers. The detailed
encoder structure can be found in Girdhar et al. [2016]. The vector then goes through a decoder 
which consists of ﬁve fully convolutional and ReLU layers to output a 128×128×128 voxel-based
reconstruction of the input. The detailed encoder structure can be found in Wu et al. [2016b].

3.3 Reprojection Consistency

There have been works attempting to enforce the consistency between estimated 3D shape and 2D
representations in a neural network [Yan et al.  2016  Rezende et al.  2016  Wu et al.  2016a  Tulsiani
et al.  2017]. Here  we explore novel ways to include a reprojection consistency loss between the
predicted 3D shape and the estimated 2.5D sketch  consisting of a depth reprojection loss and a
surface normal reprojection loss.
We use vx y z to represent the value at position (x  y  z) in a 3D voxel grid  assuming that vx y z ∈
[0  1]  ∀x  y  z. We use dx y to denote the estimated depth at position (x  y)  and nx y = (na  nb  nc)
to denote the estimated surface normal. We assume orthographic projection in this work.
Depths The projected depth loss tries to guarantee that the voxel with depth vx y dx y should be 1 
and all voxels in front of it should be 0. This ensures the estimated 3D shape matches the estimated
depth values.
As illustrated in Figure 3a  we deﬁne projected depth loss as follows:

Ldepth(x  y  z) =

in Figure 3b  for a line that has no intersection with the shape  all voxels in it should be 0.

normal loss tries to guarantee that the voxels at (x  y  z) ± n(cid:48)
x and (x  y  z) ± n+y should be 1 to
match the estimated surface normals. These constraints only apply when the target voxels are inside
the estimated silhouette.

3.4 Training Paradigm

We employ a two-step training paradigm. We ﬁrst train the 2.5D sketch estimation and the 3D shape
estimation components separately on synthetic images; we then ﬁne-tune the network on real images.
For pre-training  we use synthetic images of ShapeNet objects. The 2.5D sketch estimator is trained
using the ground truth surface normal  depth  and silhouette images with a L2 loss. The 3D interpreter
is trained using ground truth voxels and a cross-entropy loss. Please see Section 4.1 for details on
data preparation.
The reprojection consistency loss is used to ﬁne-tune the 3D estimation component of our model on
real images  using the predicted normal  depth  and silhouette. We observe that a straightforward
implementation leads to shapes that explain 2.5D sketches well  but with unrealistic appearance. This
is because the 3D estimation module overﬁts the images without preserving the learned 3D shape
prior. See Figure 5 for examples  and Section 4.2 for more details.
We therefore choose to ﬁx the decoder of the 3D estimator and only ﬁne-tune the encoder. During
testing  our method can be self-supervised  i.e.  we can ﬁne-tune even on a single image without any
annotations. In practice  we ﬁne-tune our model separately on each image for 40 iterations. For each
test image  ﬁne-tuning takes up to 10 seconds on a modern GPU; without ﬁne-tuning  testing time
is around 100 milliseconds. We use SGD for optimization with a batch size of 4  a learning rate of
0.001  and a momentum of 0.9. We implemented our framework in Torch7 [Collobert et al.  2011].

4 Evaluation

In this section  we present both qualitative and quantitative results on single-image 3D reconstruction
using variants of our framework. We evaluate our entire framework on both synthetic and real-life
images on three datasets.

4.1

3D Reconstruction on ShapeNet

Data We start with experiments on synthesized images of ShapeNet chairs [Chang et al.  2015]. We
put objects in front of random backgrounds from the SUN database [Xiao et al.  2010]  and render the
corresponding RGB  depth  surface normal  and silhouette images. We use a physics-based renderer 
Mitsuba [Jakob  2010]  to obtain more realistic images. For each of the 6 778 ShapeNet chairs  we
render 20 images of random viewpoints.

input  estimated normal map  estimated depth map  our prediction  a baseline algorithm that predicts
3D shape directly from RGB input without modeling 2.5D sketch  and ground truth. Both normal and
depth maps are masked by predicted silhouettes. Our method is able to recover shapes with smoother
surfaces and ﬁner details.

Methods We follow the training paradigm described in Section 3.4  but without the ﬁnal ﬁne-tuning
stage  as ground truth 3D shapes are available on this synthetic dataset. Speciﬁcally  the 2.5D sketch
estimator is trained using ground truth depth  normal and silhouette images and a L2 reconstruction
loss. The 3D shape estimation module takes in the masked ground truth depth and normal images as
input  and predicts 3D voxels of size 128×128×128 with a binary cross entropy loss.
We compare MarrNet with a baseline that predicts 3D shape directly from an RGB image  without
modeling 2.5D sketches. The baseline employs the same architecture as our 3D shape estimator
(Section 3.2). We show qualitative results in Figure 4. Our estimated surface normal and depth images
abstract out non-essential information like textures and lighting in the RGB image  while preserving
intrinsic information about object shape. Compared with the direct prediction baseline  our model
outputs objects with more details and smoother surfaces. For quantitative evaluation  previous works
usually compute the Intersection-over-Union (IoU) [Tulsiani et al.  2017  Choy et al.  2016]. Our full
model achieves a higher IoU (0.57) than the direct prediction baseline (0.52).

4.2

3D Reconstruction on Pascal 3D+

Data PASCAL 3D+ dataset [Xiang et al.  2014] provides (rough) 3D models for objects in real-life
images. Here  we use the same test set of PASCAL 3D+ with earlier works [Tulsiani et al.  2017].

Methods We follow the paradigm described in Section 3.4: we ﬁrst train each module separately
on the ShapeNet dataset  and then ﬁne-tune them on the PASCAL 3D+ dataset. Unlike previous
works [Tulsiani et al.  2017]  our model requires no silhouettes as input during ﬁne-tuning; it instead
estimates silhouette jointly.
As an ablation study  we compare three variants of our model: ﬁrst  the model trained using ShapeNet
data only  without ﬁne-tuning; second  the ﬁne-tuned model whose decoder is not ﬁxed during

ﬁne-tuning; and third  the full model whose decoder is ﬁxed during ﬁne-tuning. We also compare
with the state-of-the-art method (DRC) [Tulsiani et al.  2017]  and the provided ground truth shapes.

Results The results of our ablation study are shown in Figure 5. The model trained on synthetic
data provides a reasonable shape estimate. If we ﬁne-tune the model on Pascal 3D+ without ﬁxing
the decoder  the output voxels explain the 2.5D sketch data well  but fail to preserve the learned shape
prior  leading to impossible shapes from certain views. Our ﬁnal model  ﬁne-tuned with the decoder
ﬁxed  keeps the shape prior and provides more details of the shape.
We show more results in Figure 6  where we compare with the state-of-the-art (DRC) [Tulsiani et al. 
2017]  and the provided ground truth shapes. Quantitatively  our algorithm achieves a higher IoU
over these methods (MarrNet 0.39 vs. DRC 0.34). However  we ﬁnd the IoU metric sub-optimal
for three reasons. First  measuring 3D shape similarity is a challenging yet unsolved problem  and
IoU prefers models that predict mean shapes consistently  with no emphasize on details. Second  as
object shape can only be reconstructed up to scale from a single image  it requires searching over all
possible scales during the computation of IoU  making it less efﬁcient. Third  as discussed in Tulsiani
et al. [2017]  PASCAL 3D+ has only rough 3D annotations (10 CAD chair models for all images).
Computing IoU with these shapes would thus not be the most informative evaluation metric.
We instead conduct human studies  where we show users the input image and two reconstructions 
and ask them to choose the one that looks closer to the shape in the image. We show each test image
to 10 human subjects. As shown in Table 1  our reconstruction is preferred 74% of the time to DRC 
and 42% of the time to ground truth  showing a clear advantage.
We present some failure cases in Figure 7. Our algorithm does not perform well on recovering
complex  thin structure  and sometimes fails when the estimated mask is very inaccurate. Also  while
DRC may beneﬁt from multi-view supervision  we have only evaluated MarrNet given a single view
of the shape  though adapting our formulation to multi-view data should be straightforward.

Data The IKEA dataset [Lim et al.  2013] contains images of IKEA furniture  along with accurate
3D shape and pose annotations. These images are challenging  as objects are often heavily occluded
or cropped. We also evaluate our model on the IKEA dataset.

Results We show qualitative results in Figure 8  where we compare with estimations by 3D-VAE-
GAN [Wu et al.  2016b] and the ground truth. As shown in the ﬁgure  our model can deal with mild
occlusions in real life scenarios. We also conduct human studies on the IKEA dataset. Results show
that 61% of the subjects prefer our reconstructions to those of 3D-VAE-GAN.

Figure 10. Our model successfully recovers shapes of different categories.

5 Conclusion

We proposed MarrNet  a novel model that explicitly models 2.5D sketches for single-image 3D
shape reconstruction. The use of 2.5D sketches enhanced the model’s performance  and made it
easily adaptive to images across domains or even categories. We also developed differentiable loss
functions for the consistency between 3D shape and 2.5D sketches  so that MarrNet can be end-to-end
ﬁne-tuned on real images without annotations. Experiments demonstrated that our model performs
well  and is preferred by human annotators over competitors.
