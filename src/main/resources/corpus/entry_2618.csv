Abstract 

Functional segregation and integration are fundamental characteristics of the 
human  brain.  Studying  the  connectivity  among  segregated  regions  and  the 
dynamics of integrated brain networks has drawn increasing interest . A very 
controversial  yet fundamental issue in these studies is how to determine the 
best  functional  brain  regions  or  ROIs  (regions  of  interests)  for  individuals. 
Essentially   the  computed  connectivity  patterns  and  dynamics  of  brain 
networks  are  very sensitive to the locations  sizes   and shapes of  the  ROIs. 
This  paper  presents  a  novel  methodology  to  optimize  the  locations  of  an 
individual's ROIs in the working memory system. Our strategy is to formulate 
the individual ROI optimization as a group variance minimization problem  
in  which  group-wise  functional  and  structural  connectivity  patterns   and 
anatomic profiles  are defined as optimization constraints. The optimization 
problem  is  solved  via  the  simulated  annealing  approach.  Our  experimental 
results  show 
improved 
consistency  in  structural  and  functional  profiles  across  subjects   and  have 
more  reasonable  localizations  and  more  consistent  morphological  and 
anatomic profiles.

The human brain’s function is segregated into distinct regions and integrated via axonal fibers 
[1].  Studying  the  connectivity  among  these  regions  and  modeling  their  dynamics  and 
interactions has drawn increasing interest and effort from the brain imaging and neuroscience 
communities [2-6]. For example  recently  the Human Connectome Project [7] and the 1000 
Functional  Connectomes  Project  [8]  have  embarked  to  elucidate  large-scale  connectivity 
patterns  in  the  human  brain.  For  traditional  connectivity  analysis   a  variety  of  models 
including  DCM  (dynamics  causal  modeling)   GCM  (Granger  causality  modeling)  and  MVA 
(multivariate autoregressive modeling) are proposed [6  9-10] to model the interactions of the 
ROIs. A fundamental issue in these studies is how to accurately identify the ROIs  which are 
the structural substrates for measuring connectivity. Currently  this is still an open  urgent  yet 
challenging  problem  in  many  brain  imaging  applications.  From  our  perspective   the  major 
challenges  come  from  uncertainties  in  ROI  boundary  definition   the  tremendous  variability 
across individuals  and high nonlinearities within and around ROIs.   

Current approaches for identifying brain ROIs can be broadly classified into four categories. 
The  first  is  manual  labeling  by  experts  using  their  domain  knowledge.  The  second  is  a 
data-driven clustering of ROIs from the brain image itself. For instance  the ReHo  (regional 
homogeneity) algorithm [11] has been used to identify regional homogeneous regions as ROIs. 
The third is to predefine ROIs in a template brain  and warp them back to  the individual space 
using image registration [12]. Lastly  ROIs can be defined from the activated regions observed 
during  a  task-based  fMRI  paradigm.  While  fruitful  results  have  been  achieved  using  these 
approaches   there  are  various  limitations.  For  instance   manual  labeling  is  difficult  to 
implement for large datasets and may be vulnerable to inter-subject and intra-subject variation; 

it  is  difficult  to  build  correspondence  across  subjects  using  data -driven  clustering  methods; 
warping  template  ROIs  back  to  individual  space  is  subject  to  the  accuracy  of  warping 
techniques and the anatomical variability across subjects. 

Even identifying ROIs using task-based  fMRI paradigms  which is  regarded as the standard 
approach  for  ROI identification   is  still  an open question.  It  was  reported  in  [13] that  many 
imaging-related  variables  including  scanner  vender   RF  coil  characteristics  (phase  array  vs. 
volume coil)  k-space acquisition trajectory  reconstruction algorithms  susceptibility -induced 
signal  dropout   as  well  as  field  strength  differences   contribute  to  variations  in  ROI 
identification.  Other  researchers  reported  that  spatial  smoothing   a  common  preprocessing 
technique in fMRI analysis to enhance SNR  may introduce artificial localization shift s (up to 
12.1mm  for  Gaussian  kernel  volumetric  smoothing)  [14]  or  generate  overly  smoothed 
activation maps that may obscure important details [15]. For example  as shown in Fig.1a  the 
local  maximum  of  the  ROI  was  shifted  by  4mm  due  to  the  spatial  smoothing  process. 
Additionally  
its  structural  profile  (Fig.1b)  was  significantly  altered.  Furthermore  
group-based activation maps may show different patterns from an individual's activation map; 
Fig.1c  depicts  such  differences.  The  top  panel  is  the  group  activation  map  from  a  working 
memory study  while the bottom panel is the activation map of one subject in the study. As we 
can  see  from  the  highlighted  boxes   the  subject  has  less  activated  regions  than  the  group 
analysis  result.  In  conclusion   standard  analysis  of  task-based  fMRI  paradigm  data  is 
inadequate to accurately localize ROIs for each individual.

volumetric smoothing. The top one was detected using unsmoothed data while the bottom one 
used smoothed data (FWHM: 6.875mm). (b): The corresponding fibers for the ROIs in (a). The 
ROIs are presented using a sphere (radius: 5mm). (c): Activation map differences between the 
group (top) and one subject (bottom). The highlighted boxes show two of the missing activated 
ROIs found from the group analysis.  

Without accurate and reliable individualized ROIs  the validity of brain connectivity analysis  
and  computational  modeling  of  dynamics  and  interactions  among  brain  networks    would  be 
questionable. In response to this fundamental issue  this paper presents a novel computational 
methodology  to  optimize  the  locations  of  an  individual's  ROIs  initialized  from  task-based 
fMRI. We use the ROIs identified in a block-based working memory paradigm as a test bed 
application to develop and evaluate our methodology. The optimization of ROI locations was 
formulated  as  an  energy  minimization  problem   with  the  goal  of  jointly  maximizing  the 
group-wise  consistency  of  functional  and  structural  connectivity  patterns  and  anatomic 
profiles.  The  optimization  problem  is  solved  via  the  well-established  simulated  annealing 
approach. Our experimental results show that the optimized ROIs achieved our optimization 
objectives and demonstrated promising results.

Twenty-five university students were recruited to participate in 
this study. Each participant performed an fMRI modified version 
of  the  OSPAN  task  (3  block  types:  OSPAN   Arithmetic   and 
Baseline)  while  fMRI  data  was  acquired.  DTI  scans  were  also 
acquired  for  each  participant.  FMRI  and  DTI  scans  were 
acquired on a 3T GE Signa scanner. Acquisition parameters were 
as follows : fMRI: 64x64 matrix  4mm slice  thickness  220mm 
FOV   30  slices   TR=1.5s   TE=25ms   ASSET=2;  DTI:  128x128

TR=15100ms   TE=  variable   ASSET=2   3  B0  images   30 
optimized gradient directions  b-value=1000). Each participant’s 
fMRI  data  was  analyzed  using  FSL.  Individual  activation  map 
reflecting the OSPAN (OSPAN > Baseline) contrast was used. In 
total  we identified the 16 highest activated ROIs  including left 
and right insula  left and right medial frontal gyrus  left and right 
precentral gyrus  left and right paracingulate gyrus  left and right 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  left and right inferior parietal lobule  left occipital pole  right 
frontal pole  right lateral occipital gyrus  and left and right precuneus. Fig.2 shows the 16 ROIs 
mapped  onto  a  WM(white  matter)/GM(gray  matter)  cortical  surface.  For  some  individuals  
there  may  be  missing  ROIs  on  their  activation  maps.  Under  such  condition   we  adapted  the 
group activation map as a guide to find these ROIs using linear registration.

DTI pre-processing consisted of skull removal  motion correction  and eddy current correction. 
After the pre-processing  fiber tracking was performed using MEDINRIA (FA threshold: 0.2; 
minimum fiber length: 20).  Fibers were extended along their tangent directions to reach into 
the gray matter when necessary. Brain tissue segmentation was conducted on DTI data by the 
method  in  [16]  and  the  cortical  surface  was  reconstructed  from  the  tissue  maps  using  the 
marching cubes algorithm. The cortical surface was parcellated into anatomical regions using 
the HAMMER tool [17]. DTI space was used as the standard space from which to generate the 
GM  (gray  matter)  segmentation  and  from  which  to  report  the  ROI  locations  on  the  cortical 
surface.  Since  the  fMRI  and  DTI  sequences  are  both  EPI  (echo  planar  imaging)  sequences  
their  distortions  tend  to  be  similar  and  the  misalignment  between  DTI  and  fMRI  images  is 
much less than that between T1 and fMRI images [18]. Co-registration between DTI and fMRI 
data was performed using FSL FLIRT [12]. The activated ROIs and tracked fibers  were then 
mapped onto the cortical surface for joint modeling.

Despite the high degree of variability across subjects  there are several aspects of regularity on 
which we base the proposed solution. Firstly  across subjects  the functional ROIs should have 
similar anatomical locations  e.g.  similar locations in the atlas space. Secondly  these  ROIs 
should  have  similar  structural  connectivity  profiles  across  subjects.  In  other  words   fibers 
penetrating the same functional ROIs should have at least similar target regions across subjects. 
Lastly   individual  networks  identified  by  task-based  paradigms   like  the  working  memory 
network  we  adapted  as  a  test  bed  in  this  paper   should  have  similar  functional  connectivity 
pattern across subjects.  The neuroscience bases of  the  above premises include: 1) structural 
and  functional  brain  connectivity  are  closely  related  [19]   and  cortical  gyrification  and 
axongenesis processes are closely coupled [20]; Hence  it is reasonable to put these three types 
of information in a joint modeling framework. 2) 
Extensive studies have already demonstrated the 
existence of a common structural and functional 
architecture of the human brain [21  22]  and it 
makes sense to assume that the working memory 
network  has  similar  structural  and  functional 
connectivity patterns across individuals.   

Based  on  these  premises   we  proposed  to 
optimize  the  locations  of  individual  functional 
ROIs  by  jointly  modeling  anatomic  profiles  
structural  connectivity  patterns   and  functional 
connectivity patterns  as illustrated in Fig 3. The

goal was to minimize the group-wise variance (or maximize group-wise consistency) of these 
jointly modeled profiles. Mathematically  we modeled the group-wise variance as energy 
 as 
follows.  A  ROI  from  fMRI  analysis  was  mapped  onto  the  surface   and  is  represented  by  a 
center vertex and its neighborhood. Suppose 𝑅𝑖𝑗 is the ROI region 
 on the cortical surface of 
 identified in Section 2.1; we find a corresponding surface ROI region 𝑆𝑖𝑗 so that the

is  defined  to  ensure  that  the 
optimized ROIs have similar anatomical locations in  the atlas 
space  (Fig.4  shows  an  example  of  ROIs  of  15  randomly 
selected subjects in the atlas space). We model the locations for 
all  ROIs  in  the  atlas  space  using  a  Gaussian  model  (mean:  
𝑀𝑋𝑗  and  standard  deviation: 
).  The  model 
parameters were estimated using the initial locations obtained

   the  anatomical  constraint  energy  will  always  be  one;  if  not   there  will  be  an 

exponential  increase  of  the  energy  which  punishes  the  possible  involvement  of  outliers.    In 
other words  this energy factor will ensure the optimized ROIs  will not significantly deviate 
away from the original ROIs.

The  minimization  of  the  energy  defined  in  Section  2.2  is  known  as  a  combinatorial 
optimization problem. Traditional optimization methods may not fit this problem  since there 
are two  noticeable  characteristics  in  this  application. First  we  do  not   know how  the energy 
changes  with  the  varying  locations  of  ROIs.  Therefore   techniques  like  Newton’s  method 
cannot  be  used.    Second   the  structure  of  search  space  is  not  smooth   which  may  lead  to 
multiple local minima during optimization. To address this p roblem  we adopt the simulated 
annealing (SA) algorithm [23] for the energy minimization. The idea of the SA algorithm is 
based  on  random  walk  through  the  space  for  lower  energies.  In  these  random  walks   the 
probability of taking a step is determined by the Boltzmann distribution

temperature. In other words  a step will be taken when a lower energy is found. A step will also 
be taken with probability 
if a higher energy is found. This helps avoid the local minima in 

the search space.

Compared  to  structural  and  functional  connectivity  patterns   anatomical  profiles  are  more

designed to provide constraint only to ROIs that are obviously far away from  reasonableness.  
The reasonable range was statistically modeled by the localizations of ROIs warped into the 
atlas space in Section 2.2.1. Our focus in this paper is the structural and functional profiles.

In this section  we use only anatomical and structural  connectivity profiles to optimize the 

locations of ROIs. The goal is to check whether the structural constraint energy 
 works as 
expected. Fig.6 shows the fibers penetrating the right precuneus for eight subjects before (top 
panel) and after optimization (bottom panel). The ROI is highlighted in a red sphere for each 
subject. As we can see from the figure (please refer to the highlighted yellow arrows)  after 
optimization  the third and sixth subjects have significantly improved consistency with the rest 
of the group than before optimization  which proves the validity of the energy function Eq.(4).

In this section  we  optimize the locations of ROIs using anatomical  and  functional profiles  
aiming to validate the definition of functional connectivity constraint energy
. If this energy 

constraint worked well  the functional connectivity variance of the working memory system 
across  subjects  would  decrease.  Fig.7  shows  the  comparison  of  the  standard  derivation  for 
functional connectivity before (left) and after (right) optimization. As we can see  the variance 
is significantly reduced after optimization. This demonstrated the effectiveness of the defined 
functional connectivity constraint energy.

times with random initial ROI locations that met the anatomical constraint.  

The  relationship  between  structure  and  function  has  been  extensively  studied  [24]   and  it  is 
widely believed that they are closely related. In this section  we study the relationship between 
functional profiles and structural profiles by looking at how the energy for one of them changes 
while the energy of the other decreases. The optimization processes in Section 3.1 and 3.2 were 
repeated  15  times  respectively  with  random  initial  ROI  locations  that  met  the  anatomical 
constraint. As shown in Fig.8  in general  the functional profile energies and structural profile 
energies are closely related in such a way that the functional profile energies tend to decrease 
along with the structural profile optimization process  while the structural profile energies also 
tend to decrease as the functional profile is optimized. This positively correlated decrease of 
functional profile energy and structural profile energy not only proves the close relationship 
between  functional  and  structural  profiles   but  also  demonstrates  the  consistency  between 
functional and structural optimization  laying down the foundation of the joint optimiza tion  
whose results are detailed in the following section.

In this section  we used all the constraints in Eq. (1) to optimize the individual locations of all 
ROIs  in  the  working  memory  system.  Ten  runs  of  the  optimization  were  performed  using 
random  initial  ROI  locations  that  met  the  anatomical  constraint.  Weighting  parameter 
 
equaled  0.5  for all these runs. Starting and ending temperatures  for the simulated annealing 
algorithm  are  8  and  0.05;  Boltzmann  constant
.  As  we  can  see  from  Fig.9   most  runs 
started  to  converge  at  step  24   and  the  convergence  energy  is  quite  close  for  all  runs.  This 
indicates that the simulated annealing algorithm provides a valid solution  to our problem.  

By visual inspection  most of the ROIs move to more reasonable and consistent locations after 
the joint optimization.  As an example  Fig.10 depicts the location movements of the ROI in 
Fig. 6 for eight subjects.  As we can see  the ROIs for these subjects share a similar anatomical 

1Klandmark  which appears to be the tip of the upper bank of the  parieto-occipital sulcus. If the 
initial ROI was not at this landmark  it  moved to the landmark after the optimization  which 
was the case for subjects 1  4 and 7. The structural profiles of these ROIs are very similar to 
Fig.6. The results in Fig. 10 indicate the significant improvement of ROI locations achieved by 
the joint optimization procedure.

This  paper  presented  a  novel  computational  approach  to  optimize  the  locations  of  ROIs 
identified  from  task-based  fMRI.  The  group-wise  consistency  of  functional  and  structural 
connectivity  patterns   and  anatomical  locations  are  jointly  modeled  and  formulated  in  an 
energy  function   which  is  minimized  by  the  simulated  annealing  optimization  algorithm. 
Experimental results demonstrate the optimized ROIs have more reasonable localizations  and 
have significantly improved the consistency of structural and functional connectivity profiles 
and morphological and anatomic profiles across subjects. Our future work includes extending 
this framework to optimize other parameters of ROIs such as size and shape  and applying and 
evaluating this methodology to the optimization of ROIs identified in other brain systems such
