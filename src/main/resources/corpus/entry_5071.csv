Abstract

Sodium entry during an action potential determines the energy efﬁciency of a
neuron. The classic Hodgkin-Huxley model of action potential generation is
notoriously inefﬁcient in that regard with about 4 times more charges ﬂowing
through the membrane than the theoretical minimum required to achieve the ob-
served depolarization. Yet  recent experimental results show that mammalian neu-
rons are close to the optimal metabolic efﬁciency and that the dynamics of their
voltage-gated channels is signiﬁcantly different than the one exhibited by the clas-
sic Hodgkin-Huxley model during the action potential. Nevertheless  the original
Hodgkin-Huxley model is still widely used and rarely to model the squid giant
axon from which it was extracted. Here  we introduce a novel family of Hodgkin-
Huxley models that correctly account for sodium entry  action potential width
and whose voltage-gated channels display a dynamics very similar to the most
recent experimental observations in mammalian neurons. We speak here about a
family of models because the model is parameterized by a unique parameter the
variations of which allow to reproduce the entire range of experimental observa-
tions from cortical pyramidal neurons to Purkinje cells  yielding a very economical
framework to model a wide range of different central neurons. The present paper
demonstrates the performances and discuss the properties of this new family of
models.

Introduction

Action potentials play the central role in neuron-to-neuron communication. At the onset of an action
potential  the change in the membrane potential leads to opening of voltage-gated sodium channels 
leading to inﬂux of sodium ions. Once the membrane is sufﬁciently depolarized  the opening of
voltage-gated potassium channels leads to an efﬂux of potassium ions and brings the membrane
back to the resting potential. During and after this process  the ionic gradients are restored by the
Na K-ATPase electrogenic pump which extrudes 3 sodium ions in exchange for 2 potassium ions
and requires 1 ATP molecule per cycle.

There is thus a metabolic cost in terms of ATP molecules to be spent associated with every action
potential. This metabolic cost can be roughly estimated to be 1/3 of the sodium entry into the
neuron. A metabolically efﬁcient action potential would have sodium entry restricted to the rising
phase of the action potential so that a minimal number of charges is transported to produce the
observed voltage change. This can be encapsulated into a measure called Sodium Entry Ratio (SER)
deﬁned as the integral of the sodium current during the action potential divided by the product of
the membrane capacitance by the observed change in membrane voltage. A metabolically optimally
efﬁcient neuron would have a SER of 1 or close to 1.
The metabolic efﬁciency critically depends on the gating kinetics of the voltage-dependent channels
and on their interaction during the action potential. All biophysical models of action potential gener-
ation rely on the framework originally established by Hodgkin and Huxley [1] and certain models in
use today still rely on their parameters for the voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels respon-
sible for the action potential generation  even though parameterization of the Hodgkin-Huxley model
optimized for certain mammalian neurons have been available and used for years [2 3]. Analyzing
the squid giant axon action potential  Hodgkin and Huxley established that the SER is approxi-
mately 4  owing to the fact that the sodium channels remain open during the falling phase of the
action potential [1]. This has led to the idea that action potentials are metabolically inefﬁcient and
these numbers were used as key input in a number of studies aiming at establishing an energy budget
for brain tissue (see e.g. [4]). However  two recent studies have demonstrated that mammalian neu-
rons  having fundamentally similar action potentials as the squid giant axon  are signiﬁcantly more
efﬁcient owing to lesser sodium entry during the falling phase of the action potential [5 6].
In the ﬁrst study  Alle and colleagues observed that action potentials in mossy ﬁber boutons of hip-
pocampal granule neurons have about 30% extra sodium entry than the theoretical minimum [5]
(SER (cid:39) 1.3). In the second study  Carter and Bean expanded this ﬁnding  showing that different
central neurons have different SERs [6]. More speciﬁcally  they measured that cortical pyramidal
neurons are the most efﬁcient with a SER (cid:39) 1.2 while pyramidal neurons from the CA1 hippocam-
pus region have a SER (cid:39) 1.6. On the other hand  inhibitory neurons were found to have less
efﬁcient action potentials with cerebellar Purkinje neurons having a SER (cid:39) 2 and cortical basket
cell interneurons having a SER (cid:39) 2.
Interestingly  this is postulated to originate in the type or
distribution of voltage-gated potassium channels present in each of these cell types. Even the less
efﬁcient neurons are twice more metabolically efﬁcient than the original Hodgkin-Huxley neuron.
These recent ﬁndings call for a revision of the original Hodgkin-Huxley model which fails on several
accounts to describe accurately central mammalian neurons.
The aim of the present work is to formulate an in silico model for an accurate description of the
sodium and potassium currents underlying the generation of action potentials in central mammalian
neurons. To this end  we introduce a novel family of Hodgkin-Huxley models HHξ parameterized
by a single parameter ξ. Varying ξ in a meaningful range allows reproducing the whole range of
observations of Carter and Bean [6] providing a very economic modeling strategy that can be used
to model a wide range of central neurons from cortical pyramidal neurons to Purkinje cells.
The next section provides a brief description of the model  of the strategy to design it as well as a
formal deﬁnition of the key parameters like the Sodium Entry Ratio against which the predictions
of our family of models is compared. The third section demonstrates the performances of the novel
family of models and characterize its properties. Finally the last section discusses the implications
of our results.

2 Model and methods

2.1 Hodgkin-Huxley model family

In order to develop a novel family of Hodgkin-Huxley models  we started from the original Hodgkin-
Huxley formalism [1]. In this formalism  the evolution of the membrane voltage V is governed by

C

dV
dt

Ik + Iext

(1)

= −(cid:88)

k

2

with C the membrane capacitance and Iext an externally applied current. The currents Ik are trans-
membrane ionic currents. Following the credo  they are described by

Ik = gNa m3 h (V − ENa) + gK n4 (V − EK) + gL (V − EL)

(2)

−(cid:88)

k

with gNa  gK and gL the ionic conductances and ENa  EK and EL the reversal potentials associated
with the sodium current iNa = gNa m3 h (V − ENa)  the potassium current iK = gK n4 (V − EK)
and the uncharacterized leak current iL = gL (V −EL). All three gating variables m  n and h follow
the generic equation

= αx(V ) (1 − x) − βx(V ) x

dx
dt

with x standing alternatively for m  n or h. The terms αx and βx are non-trivial functions of the
voltage V . It is sometimes useful to reformulate Eq. 3 as

dx
dt

= − 1

τx(V )

(x − x∞(V ))

(4)

in which the equilibrium value x∞ = αx/(αx +βx) is reached with the time constant τx = 1/(αx +
βx) which has units of [ms].
Speciﬁc values for the constants (C  gx and Ex) and for the functions αx and βx were originally
chosen to match those introduced in [7] with the exception that the model introduced in [7] includes
a secondary potassium channel that was abandoned here  thus retaining only the channels originally
described by Hodgkin and Huxley. The reversal potentials Ex were then adjusted to match known
concentrations of the respective ions in and around mammalian cells.
We then proceeded to explore the behavior of the model and observed that the speciﬁc dynamics of
iNa and iK during an action potential is critically dependent on the exact deﬁnition of αn. In our
case  αn is deﬁned by

αn(V ) =

p1 V − p2

1 − e−(p3 V −p4)/p5

(3)

(5)

with p1  . . .  p5 some parameters. More speciﬁcally  we observed that by varying p5 in a meaning-
ful range  we could reproduce qualitatively the observations of Carter and Bean [6] regarding the
dynamics of the sodium current iNa during individual action potentials.
Building on these premises  we set p5 = ξ with ξ varying in the range 10.5 ≤ ξ ≤ 16. These
boundary values were chosen relatively arbitrarily by exploring the range in which the models stay
close to experimental observations. All the other parameters appearing in the αx and βx functions
were then optimized using a standard optimization algorithm so that the model reproduces as closely
as possible the values characterizing action potential dynamics as reported in [6].
The ﬁnal values for parameters of the novel family of Hodgkin-Huxley models are reported in Table
1. The values of other parameters used in the model are: C = 1.0 µF/cm2  gL = 0.25 mS/cm2 
EL = −70 mV.

2.2 Sodium entry ratio and numerics

The relevant parameters to compare the novel family of Hodgkin-Huxley models HHξ to the exper-
imental dataset under consideration are: (i) the action potential peak  (ii) the action potential width
and (iii) the sodium entry ratio (SER). The action potential peak is simply deﬁned as the maximal
depolarization reached during the action potential. Following [6]  the action potential width is mea-
sured at half the action potential height  measured as the difference in membrane potential from the
peak to the resting potential. Finally  still following [6]  the SER is deﬁned for an isolated action
potential by

(cid:90)

SER =

iNa/C∆V

(6)

with ∆V the change in voltage during the action potential measured from the action potential thresh-
old ϑ to its peak. The action potential threshold ϑ was deﬁned as 1% of the maximal dV /dt.
All simulations were implemented in MATLAB (The Mathworks  Natick MA). The system of equa-
tions was integrated using a solver for stiff problems and a time step of 0.05 ms.

3 Results

Recent experimental results suggest that the dynamics of the action potential generating voltage-
gated channels in the classical Hodgkin-Huxley model do not correctly reproduce what is observed
in mammalian neurons [5 6]. More speciﬁcally  the Hodgkin-Huxley equations generate a sodium
current with a characteristic secondary peak during the action potential decaying phase  leading to
a very important inﬂux of sodium ions that counter the effect of potassium ions making the model
metabolically inefﬁcient [1]. Mammalian neurons display a sodium current with a unique sharp peak
or at most a low amplitude secondary peak [5 6].

between the action potential width and the SER. Experimental observations (red squares) are adapted
from [4]. Data were collected for (from left to right): Purkinje cells  cortical interneurons  CA1
pyramidal neurons and cortical pyramidal neurons. Error bars stand for the standard deviation. The
red line is a simple linear regression through the experimental data (R2 = 0.99). The predictions
of our model (black squares) are indicated for decreasing values of ξ from left (ξ = 16) to right
(ξ = 10.5).

In the precedent section  we have introduced a novel family of models HHξ parameterized by the
unique parameter ξ (see Table 1). We will now show how varying ξ allows reproducing the wide
range of dynamics observed experimentally. Figure 1 shows the behavior of HHξ during an isolated
action potential for three different values of ξ. In all three cases  the action potential is triggered
by the same unique square pulse of current generating an isolated action potential with roughly the
same latency about 4 s after the end of the stimulating pulse. Yet the behavior of the model is very
different in each case. For low values of ξ  the sodium current iNa exhibits a single very sharp
peak  being almost null after the action potential has peaked. At high values of ξ  iNa exhibits a
distinctive secondary peak after the action potential has peaked. The potassium current iK is also
much bigger in the latter case. As a consequence  the model has a low Sodium Entry Ratio (SER) at
low values of ξ and a high SER at high values of ξ (see Eq. 6). We also observe a negative correlation
between ξ and the width of the action potential. The width of action potentials decreases when ξ
increases. Finally action potentials generated at low ξ values return to the resting potential from
above while action potentials generated at high ξ values exhibit an after-hyperpolarization. These
different instances of our family of models HHξ cover all the experimentally observed behaviors as
reported in [6] (compare with Figures 1-3 therein).
Indeed  Carter and Bean observed neurons with low SER  broad action potentials and a single sharp
peak in the sodium current dynamics (cortical and CA1 pyramidal neurons). They also observed
neurons with high SER  narrow action potentials and a distinctive secondary peak in the sodium
current dynamics during the action potential decaying phase (cortical interneurons and cerebellar
Purkinje cells). Figure 2 compares the predictions of our model family with the observations re-
ported in [6]. It clearly demonstrates that by varying ξ  our model family is able to capture the
whole range of observed behaviors and quantitatively ﬁts the measured SER and action potential
widths. We also observe a faint positive correlation between the action potential width and its peak
like in [6] (not shown).
While the dynamics of gating variables is traditionally formulated in terms of αx and βx functions
(see Eq. 3)  it is convenient to reformulate the governing equation in the form of Eq. 4  yielding for

each gating variable an equilibrium value x∞(V ) and a time constant τx(V ). Figure 3 shows x∞ and
τx for all three gating variables of the model as a function of the membrane voltage V   the variable
opening the sodium channel m  the variable closing the sodium channel h and the variable associated
with the potassium channel n. With increment in the value of ξ  the asymptotic value n∞ shifts
towards lower membrane potentials  in other words for the same membrane voltage  the equilibrium
value is higher. On the opposite  with increment in the value of ξ  the time constant τx is reduced in
the range [−40; +40] mV. In summary  at low ξ values  the potassium current iK is only activated
when the membrane potential is high and it kicks in slowly. At high ξ values  iK is activated earlier
in the action potential and kicks in faster. This supports remarkably well the arguments of Carter
and Bean to explain the relative metabolic inefﬁciency of GABAergic neurons. Indeed  fast-spiking
neurons with narrow action potentials use fast-activating Kv3 channels to repolarize the membrane.
It is postulated that  in these cells  recovery begins sooner and from more hyperpolarized voltages
in remarkable agreement with the evolution of n∞ and τn in our modeling framework. It is also
interesting to note that Kv3 channels enable fast spiking [8]. This is supposedly due to incomplete
sodium channel inactivation and to earlier recovery  in effect speeding recovery and reducing the
refractory period.
Finally  Figure 4 shows the membrane voltage V when the model is subjected to a constant input
as well as the corresponding gain functions or frequency versus current curves. The f − I curve
has the typical saturating proﬁle observed for many neurons [9] and all the models start spiking at a
non-zero frequency. In line with the idea that neurons with a sharp action potential and incomplete
inactivation of sodium channels can spike faster  the discharge frequency increases with the value of
ξ for a given input current.

4 Discussion

Recent experimental results have highlighted that the original Hodgkin-Huxley model [1] is not
particularly well suited to describe the dynamics of sodium and potassium voltage-gated channels
during the course of an action potential in mammalian neurons. The Hodgkin-Huxley model is also a
poor foundation for studies dedicated to computing an energy budget for the mammalian brain since
it severely overestimates the metabolic cost associated with action potentials by at least a factor of
2. Despite that  the Hodgkin-Huxley model is still widely used and often for modeling projects
speciﬁcally targeting the mammalian brain.

Here we have introduced a novel instance of the Hodgkin-Huxley model aimed at correcting these
issues. The proposed family of models uses the original equations of Hodgkin and Huxley as they
were formulated originally but introduces new expressions for the functions αx and βx that char-
acterize the dynamics of the gating variables m  n and h. Moreover  the speciﬁc expression for
αn depends on an extra parameter ξ. By varying ξ in a speciﬁc range  our family of models is
able to quantitatively reproduce a wide range of dynamics for the voltage-gated sodium and potas-
sium channels during individual action potentials. Our family of models is able to generate broad 
metabolically efﬁcient action potentials with a sharp single peak dynamics of the sodium current as
well as narrow  metabolically inefﬁcient action potentials with incomplete inactivation of the sodium
channels during the decaying phase of the action potential. These different behaviors cover neuron
types as different as cortical pyramidal neurons  cortical interneurons or Purkinje cells.
For this study we chose a single-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley-type model because it is well suited
to compare with the experimental conditions of Carter and Bean [6]. However  when comparing the
particular parameterization of the model that is achieved here and experimental data (see Figure 2)  it
suggests that other changes  e.g. in sodium channel inactivation  may help to explain the differences
between different cell types. It should also be noted that action potentials as narrow as 250 µs can be
as energy-efﬁcient (SER = 1.3) [10] as the widest action potentials measured by Carter and Bean [6] 
suggesting that sodium channel kinetics  in addition to potassium channel kinetics  is also different
for different cell types and subcellular compartments.
Numerous studies have been dedicated to study the energy constraints of the brain from the coding
and network design perspective [4 11] or from the channel kinetic perspective [3 5 6 12]. Recently it
has been argued that energy minimization under functional constraints could be the unifying princi-
ple governing the speciﬁc combination of ion channels that each individual neuron expresses [12]. In
support of this hypothesis  it was demonstrated that some mammalian neurons generate their action
potentials with currents that almost reach optimal metabolic efﬁciency [5]. So far  these studies have
mostly addressed the question of metabolic efﬁciency considering isolated action potentials. More-
over  it can be difﬁcult to compare neurons with very different properties. Here  we have introduced
a new family of biophysical models able to reproduce different action potentials relevant to this de-
bate and their underlying currents [6]. We believe that our approach is very valuable in providing
mechanistic insights into the speciﬁc properties of different types of neurons. It also suggests that
it could be possible to design a generic Hodgkin-Huxley-type model family that could encompass
a very broad range of different observed behaviors in a similar way than the Izhikevich model does

are inhibitory neurons less metabolically efﬁcient than excitatory neurons?
