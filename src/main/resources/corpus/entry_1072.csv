Abstract

We analyze a reweighted version of the Kikuchi approximation for estimating the
log partition function of a product distribution deﬁned over a region graph. We
establish sufﬁcient conditions for the concavity of our reweighted objective func-
tion in terms of weight assignments in the Kikuchi expansion  and show that a
reweighted version of the sum product algorithm applied to the Kikuchi region
graph will produce global optima of the Kikuchi approximation whenever the al-
gorithm converges. When the region graph has two layers  corresponding to a
Bethe approximation  we show that our sufﬁcient conditions for concavity are
also necessary. Finally  we provide an explicit characterization of the polytope of
concavity in terms of the cycle structure of the region graph. We conclude with
simulations that demonstrate the advantages of the reweighted Kikuchi approach.

Introduction

1
Undirected graphical models are a familiar framework in diverse application domains such as com-
puter vision  statistical physics  coding theory  social science  and epidemiology. In certain settings
of interest  one is provided with potential functions deﬁned over nodes and (hyper)edges of the
graph. A crucial step in probabilistic inference is to compute the log partition function of the distri-
bution based on these potential functions for a given graph structure. However  computing the log
partition function either exactly or approximately is NP-hard in general [2  17]. An active area of re-
search involves ﬁnding accurate approximations of the log partition function and characterizing the
graph structures for which such approximations may be computed efﬁciently [29  22  7  19  25  18].
When the underlying graph is a tree  the log partition function may be computed exactly via the sum
product algorithm in time linear in the number of nodes [15]. However  when the graph contains
cycles  a generalized version of the sum product algorithm known as loopy belief propagation may
either fail to converge or terminate in local optima of a nonconvex objective function [26  20  8  13].
In this paper  we analyze the Kikuchi approximation method  which is constructed from a variational
representation of the log partition function by replacing the entropy with an expression that decom-
poses with respect to a region graph. Kikuchi approximations were previously introduced in the
physics literature [9] and reformalized by Yedidia et al. [28  29] and others [1  14] in the language of
graphical models. The Bethe approximation  which is a special case of the Kikuchi approximation
when the region graph has only two layers  has been studied by various authors [3  28  5  25]. In ad-
dition  a reweighted version of the Bethe approximation was proposed by Wainwright et al. [22  16].
As described in Vontobel [21]  computing the global optimum of the Bethe variational problem may
in turn be used to approximate the permanent of a nonnegative square matrix.
The particular objective function that we study generalizes the Kikuchi objective appearing in pre-
vious literature by assigning arbitrary weights to individual terms in the Kikuchi entropy expansion.
We establish necessary and sufﬁcient conditions under which this class of objective functions is
concave  so a global optimum may be found efﬁciently. Our theoretical results synthesize known re-
sults on Kikuchi and Bethe approximations  and our main theorem concerning concavity conditions
for the reweighted Kikuchi entropy recovers existing results when specialized to the unweighted

Kikuchi [14] or reweighted Bethe [22] case. Furthermore  we provide a valuable converse result
in the reweighted Bethe case  showing that when our concavity conditions are violated  the entropy
function cannot be concave over the whole feasible region. As demonstrated by our experiments 
a message-passing algorithm designed to optimize the Kikuchi objective may terminate in local
optima for weights outside the concave region. Watanabe and Fukumizu [24  25] provide a similar
converse in the unweighted Bethe case  but our proof is much simpler and our result is more general.
In the reweighted Bethe setting  we also present a useful characterization of the concave region of
the Bethe entropy function in terms of the geometry of the graph. Speciﬁcally  we show that if the
region graph consists of only singleton vertices and pairwise edges  then the region of concavity
coincides with the convex hull of incidence vectors of single-cycle forest subgraphs of the original
graph. When the region graph contains regions with cardinality greater than two  the latter region
may be strictly contained in the former; however  our result provides a useful way to generate weight
vectors within the region of concavity. Whereas Wainwright et al. [22] establish the concavity of
the reweighted Bethe objective on the spanning forest polytope  that region is contained within the
single-cycle forest polytope  and our simulations show that generating weight vectors in the latter
polytope may yield closer approximations to the log partition function.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2  we review background information
about the Kikuchi and Bethe approximations. In Section 3  we provide our main results on concavity
conditions for the reweighted Kikuchi approximation  including a geometric characterization of the
region of concavity in the Bethe case. Section 4 outlines the reweighted sum product algorithm
and proves that ﬁxed points correspond to global optima of the Kikuchi approximation. Section 5
presents experiments showing the improved accuracy of the reweighted Kikuchi approximation over
the region of concavity. Technical proofs and additional simulations are contained in the Appendix.
2 Background and problem setup
In this section  we review basic concepts of the Kikuchi approximation and establish some termi-
nology to be used in the paper.
Let G = (V  R) denote a region graph deﬁned over the vertex set V   where each region r 2 R is a
subset of V . Directed edges correspond to inclusion  so r ! s is an edge of G if s ✓ r. We use the
following notation  for r 2 R:

A(r) := {s 2 R : r ( s}
F(r) := {s 2 R : r ✓ s}
N (r) := {s 2 R : r ✓ s or s ✓ r}

(ancestors of r)
(forebears of r)
(neighbors of r).

Z(↵) Yr2R

For R0 ✓ R  we deﬁne A(R0) =Sr2R0 A(r)  and we deﬁne F(R0) and N (R0) similarly.

We consider joint distributions x = (xs)s2V that factorize over the region graph; i.e. 

p(x) =

↵r(xr) 

(1)

for potential functions ↵r > 0. Here  Z(↵) is the normalization factor  or partition function  which
is a function of the potential functions ↵r  and each variable xs takes values in a ﬁnite discrete
set X . One special case of the factorization (1) is the pairwise Ising model  deﬁned over a graph
G = (V  E)  where the distribution is given by

and X = {1  +1}. Our goal is to analyze the log partition function

log Z(↵) = logn Xx2X |V |Yr2R

2.1 Variational representation
It is known from the theory of graphical models [14] that the log partition function (3) may be
written in the variational form

log Z(↵) =

sup

{⌧r(xr)}2R nXr2RXxr

⌧r(xr) log(↵r(xr)) + H(p⌧ )o 

(4)

where p⌧ is the maximum entropy distribution with marginals {⌧r(xr)} and

H(p) := Xx

p(x) log p(x)

is the usual entropy. Here  R denotes the R-marginal polytope; i.e.  {⌧r(xr) : r 2 R} 2 R if
and only if there exists a distribution ⌧ (x) such that ⌧r(xr) =Px\r
⌧ (xr  x\r) for all r. For ease of
notation  we also write ⌧ ⌘ {⌧r(xr) : r 2 R}. Let ✓ ⌘ ✓(x) denote the collection of log potential
functions {log(↵r(xr)) : r 2 R}. Then equation (4) may be rewritten as
(5)
⌧2R {h✓  ⌧i + H(p⌧ )} .
µ2M{h  µi + H(pµ)}  

(6)
which appears in Wainwright and Jordan [23]. Here  M ⌘ M(G) denotes the marginal polytope 
corresponding to the collection of mean parameter vectors of the sufﬁcient statistics in the exponen-
tial family representation (2)  ranging over different values of   and pµ is the maximum entropy
distribution with mean parameters µ.

Specializing to the Ising model (2)  equation (5) gives the variational representation

log Z(✓) = sup

A() = sup

2.2 Reweighted Kikuchi approximation
Although the set R appearing in the variational representation (5) is a convex polytope  it may
have exponentially many facets [23]. Hence  we replace R with the set

K

R =n⌧ : 8t  u 2 R s.t. t ✓ u Xxu\t

⌧u(xt  xu\t) = ⌧t(xt) and 8u 2 R Xxu

⌧u(xu) = 1o

of locally consistent R-pseudomarginals. Note that R ✓ K
ally many facets  making optimization more tractable.
In the case of the pairwise Ising model (2)  we let L ⌘ L(G) denote the polytope K
the collection of nonnegative functions ⌧ = (⌧s  ⌧st) satisfying the marginalization constraints

R and the latter set has only polynomi-

R . Then L is

⌧s(xs) = 1 

Pxt

⌧st(xs  xt) = ⌧s(xs) and Pxs

Pxs

⌧st(xs  xt) = ⌧t(xt) 

8s 2 V 
8(s  t) 2 E.

Recall that M(G) ✓ L(G)  with equality achieved if and only if the underlying graph G is a tree. In
the general case  we have R = K
R when the Hasse diagram of the region graph admits a minimal
representation that is loop-free (cf. Theorem 2 of Pakzad and Anantharam [14]).
Given a collection of R-pseudomarginals ⌧  we also replace the entropy term H(p⌧ )  which is
difﬁcult to compute in general  by the approximation

H(p⌧ ) ⇡Xr2R

⇢rHr(⌧r) := H(⌧ ; ⇢) 

(7)

where Hr(⌧r) := Pxr

⌧r(xr) log ⌧r(xr) is the entropy computed over region r  and {⇢r : r 2 R}
are weights assigned to the regions. Note that in the pairwise Ising case (2)  with p := p  we have
the equality
H(p) =Xs2V

Hs(ps)  X(s t)2E

when G is a tree  where Ist(pst) = Hs(ps) + Ht(pt)  Hst(pst) denotes the mutual information
and ps and pst denote the node and edge marginals. Hence  the approximation (7) is exact with

Ist(pst)

⇢st = 1 

8(s  t) 2 E 

and

⇢s = 1  deg(s) 

8s 2 V.

Using the approximation (7)  we arrive at the following reweighted Kikuchi approximation:

3 Main results and consequences
In this section  we analyze the concavity of the Kikuchi variational problem (8). We derive a sufﬁ-
cient condition under which the function B✓ ⇢(⌧ ) is concave over the set K
R   so global optima of
the reweighted Kikuchi approximation may be found efﬁciently. In the Bethe case  we also show
that the condition is necessary for B✓ ⇢(⌧ ) to be concave over the entire region K
R   and we provide
a geometric characterization of K

R in terms of the edge and cycle structure of the graph.

3.1 Sufﬁcient conditions for concavity

We begin by establishing sufﬁcient conditions for the concavity of B✓ ⇢(⌧ ). Clearly  this is equiva-
lent to establishing conditions under which H(⌧ ; ⇢) is concave. Our main result is the following:
Theorem 1. If ⇢ 2 R|R| satisﬁes

⇢s  0 

8S ✓ R 

(10)

Xs2F(S)

then the Kikuchi entropy H(⌧ ; ⇢) is strictly concave on K
R .

The proof of Theorem 1 is contained in Appendix A.1  and makes use of a generalization of Hall’s
marriage lemma for weighted graphs (cf. Lemma 1 in Appendix A.2).
The condition (10) depends heavily on the structure of the region graph. For the sake of inter-
pretability  we now specialize to the case where the region graph has only two layers  with the ﬁrst
layer corresponding to vertices and the second layer corresponding to hyperedges. In other words 
for r  s 2 R  we have r ✓ s only if |r| = 1  and R = V [ F   where F is the set of hyperedges and
V denotes the set of singleton vertices. This is the Bethe case  and the entropy

H(⌧ ; ⇢) =Xs2V

⇢sHs(⌧s) +X↵2F

⇢↵H↵(⌧↵)

is consequently known as the Bethe entropy.
The following result is proved in Appendix A.3:
Corollary 1. Suppose ⇢↵  0 for all ↵ 2 F   and the following condition also holds:

Xs2U

⇢s + X↵2F : ↵\U6=;

⇢↵  0 

8U ✓ V.

(11)

(12)

Then the Bethe entropy H(⌧ ; ⇢) is strictly concave over K
R .

3.2 Necessary conditions for concavity

We now establish a converse to Corollary 1 in the Bethe case  showing that condition (12) is also
necessary for the concavity of the Bethe entropy. When ⇢↵ = 1 for ↵ 2 F and ⇢s = 1  |N (s)|
for s 2 V   we recover the result of Watanabe and Fukumizu [25] for the unweighted Bethe case.
However  our proof technique is signiﬁcantly simpler and avoids the complex machinery of graph
zeta functions. Our approach proceeds by considering the Bethe entropy H(⌧ ; ⇢) on appropriate
slices of the domain K
R so as to extract condition (12) for each U ✓ V . The full proof is provided
in Appendix B.1.
Theorem 2. If the Bethe entropy H(⌧ ; ⇢) is concave over K
R   then ⇢↵  0 for all ↵ 2 F   and
condition (12) holds.

Indeed  as demonstrated in the simulations of Section 5  the Bethe objective function B✓ ⇢(⌧ ) may
have multiple local optima if ⇢ does not satisfy condition (12).

3.3 Polytope of concavity

We now characterize the polytope deﬁned by the inequalities (12). We show that in the pairwise
Bethe case  the polytope may be expressed geometrically as the convex hull of single-cycle forests

4

formed by the edges of the graph. In the more general (non-pairwise) Bethe case  however  the
polytope of concavity may strictly contain the latter set.
Note that the Bethe entropy (11) may be written in the alternative form

H(⌧ ; ⇢) =Xs2V

⇢0sHs(⌧s) X↵2F

⇢↵eI↵(⌧↵) 

whereeI↵(⌧↵) := {Ps2↵ Hs(⌧s)}  H↵(⌧↵) is the KL divergence between the joint distribution ⌧↵
and the product distributionQs2↵ ⌧s  and the weights ⇢0s are deﬁned appropriately.
We show that the polytope of concavity has a nice geometric characterization when ⇢0s = 1 for
all s 2 V   and ⇢↵ 2 [0  1] for all ↵ 2 F . Note that this assignment produces the expression
for the reweighted Bethe entropy analyzed in Wainwright et al. [22] (when all elements of F have
cardinality two). Equation (13) then becomes

H(⌧ ; ⇢) =Xs2V⇣1  X↵2N (s)

and the inequalities (12) deﬁning the polytope of concavity are
(|↵ \ U|  1)⇢↵  |U| 

X↵2F : ↵\U6=;

Consequently  we deﬁne

8U ✓ V.

C :=n⇢ 2 [0  1]|F| : X↵2F : ↵\U6=;

(|↵ \ U|  1)⇢↵  |U| 

8U ✓ Vo.

By Theorem 2  the set C is the region of concavity for the Bethe entropy (14) within [0  1]|F|.
We also deﬁne the set

F := {1F 0 : F 0 ✓ F and F 0 [ N (F 0) is a single-cycle forest in G} ✓ {0  1}|F| 

where a single-cycle forest is deﬁned to be a subset of edges of a graph such that each connected
component contains at most one cycle. (We disregard the directions of edges in G.) The following
theorem gives our main result. The proof is contained in Appendix C.1.
Theorem 3. In the Bethe case (i.e.  the region graph G has two layers)  we have the containment
conv(F) ✓ C. If in addition |↵| = 2 for all ↵ 2 F   then conv(F) = C.
The signiﬁcance of Theorem 3 is that it provides us with a convenient graph-based method for
constructing vectors ⇢ 2 C. From the inequalities (15)  it is not even clear how to efﬁciently verify
whether a given ⇢ 2 [0  1]|F| lies in C  since it involves testing 2|V | inequalities.
Comparing Theorem 3 with known results  note that in the pairwise case (|↵| = 2 for all ↵ 2 F ) 
Theorem 1 of Wainwright et al. [22] states that the Bethe entropy is concave over conv(T)  where
T ✓ {0  1}|E| is the set of edge indicator vectors for spanning forests of the graph. It is trivial to
check that T ✓ F  since every spanning forest is also a single-cycle forest. Hence  Theorems 2
and 3 together imply a stronger result than in Wainwright et al. [22]  characterizing the precise
region of concavity for the Bethe entropy as a superset of the polytope conv(T) analyzed there. In
the unweighted Kikuchi case  it is also known [1  14] that the Kikuchi entropy is concave for the
assignment ⇢ = 1F when the region graph G is connected and has at most one cycle. Clearly 
1F 2 C in that case  so this result is a consequence of Theorems 2 and 3  as well. However  our
theorems show that a much more general statement is true.
It is tempting to posit that conv(F) = C holds more generally in the Bethe case. However  as the fol-
lowing example shows  settings arise where conv(F) ( C. Details are contained in Appendix C.2.
Example 1. Consider a two-layer region graph with vertices V = {1  2  3  4  5} and factors ↵1 =
{1  2  3}  ↵2 = {2  3  4}  and ↵3 = {3  4  5}. Then (1  1
In fact  Example 1 is a special case of a more general statement  which we state in the following
proposition. Here  F := {F 0 ✓ F : 1F 0 2 F}  and an element F ⇤ 2 F is maximal if it is not
contained in another element of F.

Proposition 1. Suppose (i) G is not a single-cycle forest  and (ii) there exists a maximal element
F ⇤ 2 F such that the induced subgraph F ⇤ [ N (F ⇤) is a forest. Then conv(F) ( C.
The proof of Proposition 1 is contained in Appendix C.3. Note that if |↵| = 2 for all ↵ 2 F   then
condition (ii) is violated whenever condition (i) holds  so Proposition 1 provides a partial converse
to Theorem 3.
4 Reweighted sum product algorithm
In this section  we provide an iterative message passing algorithm to optimize the Kikuchi varia-
tional problem (8). As in the case of the generalized belief propagation algorithm for the unweighted
Kikuchi approximation [28  29  11  14  12  27] and the reweighted sum product algorithm for the
Bethe approximation [22]  our message passing algorithm searches for stationary points of the La-
grangian version of the problem (8). When ⇢ satisﬁes condition (10)  Theorem 1 implies that the
problem (8) is strictly concave  so the unique ﬁxed point of the message passing algorithm globally
maximizes the Kikuchi approximation.
Let G = (V  R) be a region graph deﬁning our Kikuchi approximation. Following Pakzad and
Anantharam [14]  for r  s 2 R  we write r  s if r ( s and there does not exist t 2 R such that
r ( t ( s. For r 2 R  we deﬁne the parent set of r to be P(r) = {s 2 R : r  s} and the child set
of r to be C(r) = {s 2 R : s  r}. With this notation  ⌧ = {⌧r(xr) : r 2 R} belongs to the set K
if and only ifPxs\r
The message passing algorithm we propose is as follows: For each r 2 R and s 2 P(r)  let
Msr(xr) denote the message passed from s to r at assignment xr. Starting with an arbitrary positive
initialization of the messages  we repeatedly perform the following updates for all r 2 R  s 2 P(r):

⌧s(xr  xs\r) = ⌧r(xr) for all r 2 R  s 2 P(r).

Here  C > 0 may be chosen to ensure a convenient normalization condition;

e.g. 
Msr(xr) = 1. Upon convergence of the updates (16)  we compute the pseudomarginals ac-

and we obtain the corresponding Kikuchi approximation by computing the objective function (8)
with these pseudomarginals. We have the following result  which is proved in Appendix D:
Theorem 4. The pseudomarginals ⌧ speciﬁed by the ﬁxed points of the messages {Msr(xr)} via
the updates (16) and (17) correspond to the stationary points of the Lagrangian associated with the
Kikuchi approximation problem (8).

As with the standard belief propagation and reweighted sum product algorithms  we have several
options for implementing the above message passing algorithm in practice. For example  we may
perform the updates (16) using serial or parallel schedules. To improve the convergence of the
algorithm  we may damp the updates by taking a convex combination of new and previous messages
using an appropriately chosen step size. As noted by Pakzad and Anantharam [14]  we may also use
a minimal graphical representation of the Hasse diagram to lower the complexity of the algorithm.
Finally  we remark that although our message passing algorithm proceeds in the same spirit as clas-
sical belief propagation algorithms by operating on the Lagrangian of the objective function  our
algorithm as presented above does not immediately reduce to the generalized belief propagation
algorithm for unweighted Kikuchi approximations or the reweighted sum product algorithm for
tree-reweighted pairwise Bethe approximations. Previous authors use algebraic relations between
the overcounting numbers (9) in the Kikuchi case [28  29  11  14] and the two-layer structure of the
Hasse diagram in the Bethe case [22] to obtain a simpliﬁed form of the updates. Since the coefﬁ-
cients ⇢ in our problem lack the same algebraic relations  following the message-passing protocol
used in previous work [11  28] leads to more complicated updates  so we present a slightly different
algorithm that still optimizes the general reweighted Kikuchi objective.

5 Experiments
In this section  we present empirical results to demonstrate the advantages of the reweighted Kikuchi
approximation that support our theoretical results. For simplicity  we focus on the binary pairwise
Ising model given in equation (2). Without loss of generality  we may take the potentials to be
s(xs) = sxs and st(xs  xt) = stxsxt for some  = (s  st) 2 R|V |+|E|. We run our
experiments on two types of graphs: (1) Kn  the complete graph on n vertices  and (2) Tn  the
pn ⇥ pn toroidal grid graph where every vertex has degree four.
Bethe approximation. We consider the pairwise Bethe approximation of the log partition function
A() with weights ⇢st  0 and ⇢s = 1 Pt2N (s) ⇢st. Because of the regularity structure of Kn
and Tn  we take ⇢st = ⇢  0 for all (s  t) 2 E and study the behavior of the Bethe approximation
as ⇢ varies. For this particular choice of weight vector ~⇢ = ⇢1E  we deﬁne

⇢tree = max{⇢  0 : ~⇢ 2 conv(T)} 

and

⇢cycle = max{⇢  0 : ~⇢ 2 conv(F)}.

2n and ⇢cycle = 1

n and ⇢cycle = 2

n1; while for Tn  we have

It is easily veriﬁed that for Kn  we have ⇢tree = 2
⇢tree = n1
Our results in Section 3 imply that the Bethe objective function B ⇢(⌧ ) in equation (8) is concave
if and only if ⇢  ⇢cycle  and Wainwright et al. [22] show that we have the bound A()  B(; ⇢)
for ⇢  ⇢tree. Moreover  since the Bethe entropy may be written in terms of the edge mutual
information (13)  the function B(; ⇢) is decreasing in ⇢. In our results below  we observe that we
may obtain a tighter approximation to A() by moving from the upper bound region ⇢  ⇢tree to the
concavity region ⇢  ⇢cycle. In addition  for ⇢ > ⇢cycle  we observe multiple local optima of B ⇢(⌧ ).
Procedure. We generate a random potential  = (s  st) 2 R|V |+|E| for the Ising model (2) by
sampling each potential {s}s2V and {st}(s t)2E independently. We consider two types of models:

Attractive: st ⇠ Uniform[0  !st] 

and

Mixed: st ⇠ Uniform[!st  !st].

In each case  s ⇠ Uniform[0  !s]. We set !s = 0.1 and !st = 2. Intuitively  the attractive model
encourages variables in adjacent nodes to assume the same value  and it has been shown [18  19] that
the ordinary Bethe approximation (⇢st = 1) in an attractive model lower-bounds the log partition
function. For ⇢ 2 [0  2]  we compute stationary points of B ⇢(⌧ ) by running the reweighted sum
product algorithm of Wainwright et al. [22]. We use a damping factor of  = 0.5  convergence
threshold of 1010 for the average change of messages  and at most 2500 iterations. We repeat this
process with at least 8 random initializations for each value of ⇢. Figure 1 shows the scatter plots
of ⇢ and the Bethe approximation B ⇢(⌧ ). In each plot  the two vertical lines are the boundaries
⇢ = ⇢tree and ⇢ = ⇢cycle  and the horizontal line is the value of the true log partition function A().

Results. Figures 1(a)–1(d) show the results of our experiments on small graphs (K5 and T9) for
both attractive and mixed models. We see that the Bethe approximation with ⇢  ⇢cycle generally
provides a better approximation to A() than the Bethe approximation computed over ⇢  ⇢tree.
However  in general we cannot guarantee whether B(; ⇢) will give an upper or lower bound for
A() when ⇢  ⇢cycle. As noted above  we have B(; 1)  A() for attractive models.
We also observe from Figures 1(a)–1(d) that shortly after ⇢ leaves the concavity region {⇢  ⇢cycle} 
multiple local optima emerge for the Bethe objective function. The presence of the point clouds
near ⇢ = 1 in Figures 1(a) and 1(c) arises because the sum product algorithm has not converged
after 2500 iterations. Indeed  the same phenomenon is true for all our results: in the region where
multiple local optima begin to appear  it is more difﬁcult for the algorithm to converge. See Figure 2
and the accompanying text in Appendix E for a plot of the points (⇢  log10())  where  is the
ﬁnal average change in the messages at termination of the algorithm. From Figure 2  we see that the
values of  are signiﬁcantly higher for the values of ⇢ near where multiple local optima emerge. We
suspect that for these values of ⇢  the sum product algorithm fails to converge since distinct local
optima are close together  so messages oscillate between the optima. For larger values of ⇢  the local
optima become sufﬁciently separated and the algorithm converges to one of them. However  it is
interesting to note that this point cloud phenomenon does not appear for attractive models  despite
the presence of distinct local optima.
Simulations for larger graphs are shown in Figures 1(e)–1(h).
If we zoom into the region near

approximation than ⇢  ⇢tree. Moreover  the presence of the point clouds and multiple local optima
are more pronounced  and we see from Figures 1(c)  1(g)  and 1(h) that new local optima with even
worse Bethe values arise for larger values of ⇢. Finally  we note that the same qualitative behavior
also occurs in all the other graphs that we have tried (Kn for n 2 {5  10  15  20  25} and Tn for
n 2 {9  16  25  36  49  64})  with multiple random instances of the Ising model p.
6 Discussion
In this paper  we have analyzed the reweighted Kikuchi approximation method for estimating the log
partition function of a distribution that factorizes over a region graph. We have characterized nec-
essary and sufﬁcient conditions for the concavity of the variational objective function  generalizing
existing results in literature. Our simulations demonstrate the advantages of using the reweighted
Kikuchi approximation and show that multiple local optima may appear outside the region of con-
cavity.
An interesting future research direction is to obtain a better understanding of the approximation
guarantees of the reweighted Bethe and Kikuchi methods. In the Bethe case with attractive potentials
✓  several recent results [22  19  18] establish that the Bethe approximation B(✓; ⇢) is an upper bound
to the log partition function A(✓) when ⇢ lies in the spanning tree polytope  whereas B(✓; ⇢)  A(✓)
when ⇢ = 1F . By continuity  we must have B(✓; ⇢⇤) = A(✓) for some values of ⇢⇤  and it would
be interesting to characterize such values where the reweighted Bethe approximation is exact.
Another interesting direction is to extend our theoretical results on properties of the reweighted
Kikuchi approximation  which currently depend solely on the structure of the region graph and the
weights ⇢  to incorporate the effect of the model potentials ✓. For example  several authors [20  6]
present conditions under which loopy belief propagation applied to the unweighted Bethe approxi-
mation has a unique ﬁxed point. The conditions for uniqueness of ﬁxed points slightly generalize the
conditions for convexity  and they involve both the graph structure and the strength of the potentials.
We suspect that similar results would hold for the reweighted Kikuchi approximation.
