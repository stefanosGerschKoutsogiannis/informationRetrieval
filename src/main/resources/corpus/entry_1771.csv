Abstract

We take an unorthodox view of voting by expanding the design space to include
both the elicitation rule  whereby voters map their (cardinal) preferences to votes 
and the aggregation rule  which transforms the reported votes into collective
decisions. Intuitively  there is a tradeoff between the communication requirements
of the elicitation rule (i.e.  the number of bits of information that voters need to
provide about their preferences) and the efﬁciency of the outcome of the aggregation
rule  which we measure through distortion (i.e.  how well the utilitarian social
welfare of the outcome approximates the maximum social welfare in the worst case).
Our results chart the Pareto frontier of the communication-distortion tradeoff.

Introduction

AI systems are increasingly being used to make decisions that have an impact on people and society.
There is much discussion of ways to ensure that such systems reﬂect appropriate societal values  but
it is often unclear what the right choices are [1]. A promising direction is to design systems that
incorporate and aggregate people’s opinions  by building on work in social choice theory [2  3  4].
While the origins of the ﬁeld can be traced back to the contributions of Condorcet [5] and others in the
18th Century  it was founded in its modern form in the 20th Century. With his famous impossibility
result  Arrow [6] pioneered the axiomatic approach to voting  in which voting rules that aggregate
ranked preferences of individuals are compared qualitatively based on the axiomatic desiderata they
satisfy or violate. This approach underlies most of the work on voting in social choice theory [see 
e.g.  7  8].
By contrast  research in computational social choice [9] has put more emphasis on quantitative
evaluation of voting rules. In particular  Procaccia and Rosenschein [10] introduced the implicit
utilitarian voting framework  in which it is assumed that individuals (a.k.a. voters) have underlying
cardinal utilities for the different alternatives  and express ranked preferences that are consistent with
their utilities. The goal is to choose an alternative that maximizes (utilitarian) social welfare — the sum
of utilities — by relying on the reported rankings as a proxy for the latent utilities. Speciﬁcally  voting
rules are compared by their distortion  which is the worst-case ratio of the maximum social welfare to
the social welfare of the alternative they choose. The implicit utilitarian voting approach has received
signiﬁcant attention in the past decade [11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25]  and
voting rules based on it have been deployed on the online voting platform robovote.org.
Benadè et al. [13] observe that implicit utilitarian voting has another advantage: it allows comparing
not only voting rules that aggregate ranked preferences  but also voting rules that aggregate other
types of ballots  which they refer to as input formats. They further argue that we can associate each
input format with the best rule for aggregating votes in that format  and ultimately compare the

33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019)  Vancouver  Canada.

input formats themselves based on the lowest distortion they make possible. They also introduce a
new input format  threshold approval  whereby each voter is asked to report whether her utility for
each alternative is above or below a given threshold; this input format allows achieving logarithmic
distortion. The results of Benadè et al. [13] beg the question: why should we set only a single
threshold? What if we set two thresholds and ask each voter to report whether her utility for each
alternative is below the lower threshold  between the two thresholds  or above the higher threshold?
What if we set ﬁve thresholds? Or a million for that matter? Intuitively there is a tradeoff between the
number of thresholds and the distortion that can be achieved. However  perhaps adding thresholds is
not the most efﬁcient way to drive down distortion; there may be other input formats that encapsulate
more useful information. (Spoiler alert: this is indeed the case.)
Our goal in this paper is to characterize the optimal tradeoff between elicitation and distortion.
Ranking always asks voters to rank their alternatives and always asks for the same amount of
information from the voters. On the other hand  consider the input format threshold approval. The
larger the number of thresholds  the ﬁner the information we elicit about voter utilities  and the
lower the distortion. This is an example of a tradeoff between the amount of information voters are
required to report  and the distortion that can be achieved. As we elicit more information from voters
about their utilities  we should be able to achieve lower distortion. But exactly how low? To answer
this question  we need a precise way to reason about the complexity of vote elicitation. We use the
nomenclature of communication complexity [26]  and  in particular  examine the number of bits
needed to report a vote. Note that this is simply the logarithm of the number of possible votes that a
voter can provide in a given input format. Hence  plurality votes that ask a voter to report which of
the m alternatives is her top choice contain log m bits of information  while ranked preferences that
ask a voter to rank all m alternatives contain log m! = Θ(m log m) bits of information. Our main
research question is this:
For any k  given a budget of at most k bits per vote  what is the minimum distortion any voting rule
can achieve?

1.1 Our Results

Before outlining our results  we describe our framework in a bit more detail (a formal model is
presented in Section 2). A voting rule f is composed of two parts. Its elicitation rule Πf elicits
information from voters about their utilities. Essentially  it chooses a (possibly randomized) mapping
from utility functions to ﬁnitely many (say k) possible responses  and each voter uses this mapping
to cast her vote. The communication complexity of f  denoted C(f )  is then E[log k]  where the
expectation is due to random choices made by Πf . The aggregation rule Γf aggregates the votes cast
by voters to choose a single alternative (possibly in a randomized way). The distortion of f  denoted
dist(f )  is the worst-case ratio of the maximum social welfare to the (expected) social welfare of this
chosen alternative. The distortion is typically a function of the number of alternatives m. Our goal is
to study the tradeoff between C(f ) and dist(f ).
Figure 1 shows our results and positions them in the context of prior work. We note that any upper
bound with deterministic elicitation (resp. aggregation) also serves as an upper bound with randomized
elicitation (resp. aggregation)  and the converse holds for lower bounds. For deterministic elicitation 
it is known that plurality voting rule achieves Θ(m2) distortion with deterministic aggregation and
log m communication complexity  and that it is trivial to achieve Θ(m) distortion with randomized
aggregation and zero communication complexity [20]. Our lower bounds from Section 4 establish
that these are the best possible asymptotic bounds with communication complexity at most log m.
We show that these bounds do not hold for randomized elicitation by constructing a new voting rule
in Section 3  RANDSUBSET  which uses randomized elicitation and achieves o(m) distortion with
o(log m) communication complexity.
We also propose a family of voting rules  PREFTHRESHOLD  which use deterministic elicitation and
aggregation  and can achieve d distortion with O(m log(d log m)/d) communication complexity 
shown as the solid line in Figure 1. This is an improvement over bounds achievable by existing
deterministic elicitation methods (even with optimal randomized aggregation): threshold approval
√
voting has distortion Ω(
m) with communication complexity m [13]  and ranked voting has dis-
tortion Ω(
m) with communication complexity m log m [12]. In fact  this is also an improvement
over the randomized elicitation version of threshold approval voting  which still has distortion
Ω(log m/ log logm) with communication complexity m [13].

Figure 1: The ﬁgure depicts lower and upper bounds on distortion which can be achieved as a
function of communication complexity. We use the following abbreviation: det = deterministic 
rand = randomized  eli = elicitation  agg = aggregation. Red dashed lines show our lower bounds
(Theorems 4 and 6)  which apply to all voting rules using deterministic or randomized elicitation.
Red diamonds (solid line) and inverted triangle show some of the upper bounds achieved by two
families of rules we introduce — PREFTHRESHOLD (Theorem 1) and RANDSUBSET (Theorem 2) —
which use deterministic and randomized elicitation  respectively  and deterministic aggregation. We
obtain tradeoffs which Pareto-dominate the best possible tradeoffs that existing elicitation methods
(shown in blue) — such as threshold approval voting [13] and ranked voting [12] — allow even with
randomized aggregation.

In Section 5  we leverage tools from multi-party communication complexity to show that the bounds
achieved by PREFTHRESHOLD are nearly optimal: any voting rule with d distortion must have
Ω(m/d2) communication complexity with deterministic elicitation and Ω(m/d3) communication
complexity with randomized elicitation. These are presented as dashed lines in Figure 1. Note
that our upper and lower bounds differ by a factor that is almost linear or almost quadratic in d 
and sublogarithmic in m. This implies a surprising fact: when our goal is to achieve near-constant
distortion  randomization cannot signiﬁcantly help.

1.2 Related Work

There are two threads of research on implicit utilitarian voting. The ﬁrst thread does not make any
assumptions on utilities  other than that they are normalized [10  11  12  13  19  20  24  25]. The
second thread assumes that utilities are induced by a metric [14  15  16  17  18  21  22  23]; this
structure generally enables lower distortion. Our approach is consistent with the former thread.
In addition to the work of Benadè et al. [13]  discussed above  an especially relevant paper is that
of Caragiannis and Procaccia [11]. Their goal is also to achieve low distortion while keeping the
communication requirements low. To that end  they employ speciﬁc voting techniques such as
approving a single alternative (like plurality) or approving a subset of alternatives (like approval
voting) — these require log m and m bits per voter  respectively — but use what they call an
embedding to describe how voters translate their cardinal preferences into votes. However  the key
difference between the work of Caragiannis and Procaccia and our work is that our design space is
much larger: we simultaneously optimize both the embedding and the voting technique (together 
these form our elicitation rule)  as well as the aggregation rule.1

1That said  in this work we focus only on deterministic embeddings. That is  we study elicitation rules in
which voters deterministically translate their cardinal preferences into votes  and show that the foregoing result
is impossible to achieve in this case. We discuss implications of randomized embeddings in Section 6.

preferences has to be elicited in order to compute the outcome under a given voting rule. By contrast 
we are interested in designing the voting rule  and the very way in which preferences are represented 
in order to minimize distortion. In addition  the voting rules we design ask voters to report their
approximate utility for their top few choices or for a randomly chosen subset of alternatives. Related
ideas have been explored previously [28] or in parallel [29] in the computational social choice
literature  albeit in fundamentally different models.
Another loosely related line of work was initiated by Balcan and Harvey [30] and Badanidiyuru et al.
[31]. Their goal is to sketch combinatorial valuation functions  that is  to encode such functions using
a polynomial number of bits in a way that the value of each subset can be recovered approximately.
We deal with much simpler valuation functions  but  on the other hand  are looking to achieve much
lower communication complexity. We also note that in several query models it is standard to directly
query a real number [30  31  32  33  34]; by contrast  in our framework  asking for even a single real
number leads to inﬁnite communication complexity.

For k ∈ N  deﬁne [k] = {1  . . .   k}. Let x ∼ D denote that random variable x has distribution D. Let
log denote the logarithm to base 2  and ln denote the logarithm to base e. There is a set of alternatives
A with |A| = m  and a set of voters N = [n]. Each voter i ∈ N is endowed with a valuation
vi : A → R+  where vi(a) ≥ 0 represents the value of voter i for alternative a. Equivalently  we view
vi ∈ Rm
+ as a vector which contains the voter’s value for each alternative. We slightly abuse notation
a∈S vi(a) for S ⊆ A. Collectively  voter valuations are denoted (cid:126)v = (v1  . . .   vn).
i∈N vi(a). Our goal is to
a∈A vi(a) = 1 for each i ∈ N.
This can be thought of as a “one voter  one vote” principle for cardinal valuations as it prevents voters
from overshadowing other voters by expressing very high values. 2 Let ∆m denote the m-simplex 
+ whose coordinates sum to 1. Hence  we have that vi ∈ ∆m for each
i.e.  the set of all vectors in Rm
i ∈ N. Given such a vector vi ∈ ∆m  let supp(vi) ⊆ A denote the support of vi  i.e.  the set of
alternatives a for which vi(a) > 0.
Query space: Consider any interaction with voter i which elicits ﬁnitely many bits of information
and in which the voter responds deterministically. In this interaction  the voter must provide one of
ﬁnitely many (say k) possible responses. We say that this interaction elicits log k bits of information.3
It effectively partitions ∆m into k compartments  where the compartment corresponding to each
response is the set of all valuations which would result in the voter choosing that response. In other
words  any interaction which elicits log k bits of information is equivalent to a query which partitions
∆m into k compartments and asks the voter to pick the compartment in which her valuation belongs.
Let Q denote the set of all queries which partition ∆m into ﬁnitely many compartments. For a query
q ∈ Q  let k(q) denote the number of compartments created by q; the number of bits elicited is
log k(q).4 This query space incorporates traditional elicitation methods studied in the social choice
literature. For instance  plurality votes (which ask voters to report their favorite alternative) use m
compartments  k-approval votes (which ask voters to report the set of their k favorite alternatives)

use(cid:0)m

(cid:1) compartments  threshold approval votes (which ask voters to approve alternatives for which

their value is at least a given threshold) use 2m compartments  and ranked votes (which ask voters to
rank all alternatives) use m! compartments.
Voting Rule: A voting rule (or simply  a rule) f consists of two parts: an elicitation rule Πf and an
aggregation rule Γf . The (randomized) elicitation rule Πf is a distribution over Q  according to which
a query q is sampled. Each voter i provides a response ρi to this query  depending on her valuation

k

2Effectively  voters can only report the intensity of their relative preference for one alternative over another.
3For a multi-round interaction  we can concatenate the voter’s responses in different rounds. This is equivalent

to a single-round interaction in which the voter is asked to provide the entire string upfront.

4Note that the number of bits elicited may not be an integer  but 2 raised to the power of the number of
bits must be an integer. We could take the ceiling to enforce an integral number of bits  and this would only
minimally increase elicitation  but some of our lower bounds are sensitive to this non-integral formulation.

vi. We say that the elicitation rule is deterministic if it has singleton support (i.e.  it chooses a query
deterministically). The (randomized) aggregation rule Γf takes voter responses (cid:126)ρ = (ρ1  . . .   ρn) as
input  and returns a distribution over alternatives. We say that the aggregation rule is deterministic if
it always returns a distribution with singleton support. Slightly abusing notation  we denote by f ((cid:126)v)
the (randomized) alternative returned by f when voter valuations are (cid:126)v = (v1  . . .   vn). We measure
the performance of f via two metrics.

1. The communication complexity of f for m alternatives  denoted Cm(f ) = Eq∼Πf log k(q)  is
the expected number of bits of information elicited by f from each voter. We drop m from the
superscript when its value is clear from the context.

2. The distortion of f for m alternatives  denoted distm(f )  is the worst-case ratio of the optimal
social welfare to the expected social welfare achieved by f. Again  we drop m from the
superscript when its value is clear from the context. Formally

While it is desirable for a voting rule to have low communication complexity and low distortion 
typically eliciting more information from voters enables achieving low distortion. Our goal is to
understand the Pareto frontier of the tradeoff between communication complexity and distortion.

3 Upper Bounds

In this section  we derive upper bounds on the best distortion a voting rule can achieve given an
upper bound on its communication complexity (equivalently  this gives an upper bound on the
communication complexity required to achieve a given level of distortion). We construct two
families of voting rules: PREFTHRESHOLD  which use deterministic elicitation and aggregation  and
RANDSUBSET  which convert a given voting rule into one which uses randomized elicitation.

3.1 Deterministic Elicitation  Deterministic Aggregation

We begin by designing voting rules which use deterministic elicitation and deterministic aggregation —
the most practical combination. Caragiannis et al. [20] show that plurality achieves Θ(m2) distortion
with log m communication complexity  and even voting rules that elicit ranked preferences  and thus
have Θ(m log m) communication complexity  cannot achieve asymptotically better distortion.
We propose a novel voting rule PREFTHRESHOLDt (cid:96)  parametrized by t ∈ [m] and (cid:96) ∈ N. It is
presented as Algorithm 1. Its elicitation rule asks each voter to report the set of her t most preferred
alternatives  and for each alternative in this set  report her approximate value for it by picking one of
(cid:96) + 1 subintervals of [0  1]. Note that for t = 1  we use (cid:96) subintervals of [1/m  1]; this is valid because
a voter’s value for her most favorite alternative must be at least 1/m. The aggregation rule is also
intuitive: it uses the approximate values to compute an estimated social welfare of each alternative 
and picks an alternative with the highest estimated social welfare. The next theorem provides bounds
on the communication and distortion of PREFTHRESHOLDt (cid:96).5
Theorem 1. For t ∈ [m] \ {1} and (cid:96) ∈ N  we have
C(PREFTHRESHOLDt (cid:96)) = Θ
For t = 1 and (cid:96) ∈ N  we have

PREFTHRESHOLDt (cid:96) offers a tradeoff between two parameters  t and (cid:96). Increasing either parameter
increases the communication complexity but reduces the distortion. It is easy to see that there is no
(asymptotic) beneﬁt of choosing (cid:96) > log m. We make several observations.

m)  even with randomized aggregation [12].

3.2 Randomized Elicitation  Randomized Aggregation

We now present a generic approach to designing voting rules with randomized elicitation. Given
a voting rule f and an integer s ≤ m  instead of using f to select one alternative from A directly 
we sample S ⊆ A with |S| = s at random and use f to select one alternative from S. Recall
that for p ∈ N  Cp(f ) and distp(f ) denote the communication complexity and distortion of f for p
alternatives  respectively.
Clearly  this approach reduces the communication complexity from Cm(f ) to Cs(f ). Its effect on
distortion  however  is more subtle. On the one hand  selecting an alternative from S instead of A
results in an inevitable loss of welfare because we can only hope to do as well as the best alternative
in S. On the other hand  the welfare we achieve is related to the welfare of the best alternative in
S via the factor dists(f )  which can be signiﬁcantly lower than distm(f ). We show that in some
cases  this approach reduces distortion in addition to reducing communication complexity. The key
challenge in making this approach work is that we cannot apply f directly to select one alternative
from S  as the total value of the alternatives in S need not be 1. We circumvent this obstacle by
eliciting an approximate value of vi(S) from each voter i  making a number of copies of voter i that
is approximately proportional to vi(S) with each copy now having a total value of 1 for alternatives
in S  and running f on the resulting instance.

Theorem 2. For every voting rule f and s ∈ [m]  we have Cm(RANDSUBSET(f  s)) = Cs(f ) +
log(cid:100)log(4m)(cid:101) and distm(RANDSUBSET(f  s)) ≤ 4m
Using f = PREFTHRESHOLDt (cid:96) and Theorem 1  we obtain that for s ∈ [m]  t ∈ [s]  and (cid:96) ∈ N 
there is a new voting rule g = RANDSUBSET (PREFTHRESHOLDt (cid:96)  s) with

Setting (cid:96) = log s  we get O(m/t) distortion. Then  we set s = t to minimize communication
complexity to O(t log log t + log log m). This is slightly better than using PREFTHRESHOLDt log m 
which achieves O(m/t) distortion with O(t log m log m
) communication complexity. In particular 
for t = O(1) this reduces communication complexity by a factor of log m/ log log m.
An interesting choice is t = log m
log log m  which leads to distortion O (m log log m/ log m) = o(m) and
communication complexity O (t log log t + log log m) = o(log m). Note that this rule has random-
ized elicitation but deterministic aggregation. By contrast  we later show that with deterministic
elicitation  no voting rule can achieve o(m) distortion with communication complexity at most log m 
even when randomized aggregation is allowed (Theorem 4).

4 Direct Lower Bounds For Deterministic Elicitation

We now turn to deriving lower bounds on the distortion of a voting rule given an upper bound on its
communication complexity (equivalently  this gives a lower bound on the communication complexity
required to achieve a given level of distortion). In this section  we focus on deterministic elicitation.
Consider a voting rule f which uses deterministic elicitation and has communication complexity at
most log k. Hence  the (deterministic) query of f must partition ∆m into at most k compartments.
Wthout loss of generality  we can assume that f uses exactly k compartments. This is because if f
uses k(cid:48) compartments where k(cid:48) < k  then we can partition some of its compartments into smaller
compartments and derive a new voting rule g which uses exactly k compartments  receives at least
the information that f receives from the voters  and simulates the aggregation rule of f to achieve
the same distortion. Now  establishing a lower bound on the distortion of f requires analyzing the
following game between two players  the voting rule f and the adversary.

1. The voting rule f decides the partition of ∆m into k compartments.
2. The adversary decides the response of each voter.
3. The voting rule f picks a winning alternative (or a distribution over winning alternatives  if

its aggregation rule is randomized).

4. The adversary picks valuations of voters consistent with their responses in the second step.

We use this framework to derive lower bounds on the distortion of voting rules that use deterministic
elicitation. We ﬁrst focus on deterministic aggregation. Perhaps the simplest such voting rule is
plurality  which has log m communication complexity and achieves Θ(m2) distortion. This raises
an important question: What distortion can we achieve with deterministic elicitation  deterministic
aggregation  and communication complexity less than log m? The next lemma shows that the answer
turns out to be disappointing.
Theorem 3. Every voting rule that has deterministic elicitation  deterministic aggregation  and
communication complexity strictly less than log m has unbounded distortion.

Now  plurality has communication complexity log m and achieves Θ(m2) distortion. Can a dif-
ferent voting rule achieve better distortion using only log m communication complexity? Perhaps
unsurprisingly  we answer this in the negative. But the proof of this intuitive result is quite intricate.
Further  using randomized aggregation we can trivially achieve O(m) distortion with zero communi-
cation complexity (by returning the uniform distribution over alternatives). One may wonder: How
much information do we need from the voters to achieve sublinear distortion? It is easy to show that
eliciting plurality votes is not sufﬁcient. Surprisingly  we show that this holds for every log m-bit
elicitation. That is  even with randomized aggregation  eliciting log m bits per voter is asymptotically
no better than blindly selecting an alternative uniformly at random!

7

Theorem 4. Let f be a voting rule with deterministic elicitation and C(f ) ≤ log m. If f uses
deterministic (resp. randomized) aggregation  then dist(f ) = Ω(m2) (resp. Ω(m)).

For deterministic aggregation  Theorem 4 shows that eliciting log m bits per voter is not sufﬁcient to
achieve o(m2) distortion. By contrast  we know from Theorem 1 that we can achieve O(m) distortion
by eliciting O(log m) bits per voter. Similarly  for randomized aggregation  Theorem 4 shows that
eliciting log m bits per voter is not sufﬁcient to achieve o(m) distortion. However  we can achieve
o(m) distortion if we are willing to elicit ω(log m) bits per voter (Theorem 1) 6 or if we are willing
to use randomized elicitation (Theorem 2).

5 Lower Bounds Through Multi-Party Communication Complexity

In this section  we leverage tools from the literature on multi-party communication complexity to
derive lower bounds for both deterministic and randomized elicitation. Speciﬁcally  we derive lower
bounds on the communication complexity of voting rules that achieve a given level of distortion. We
begin by reviewing existing results on multi-party communication complexity  and then derive new
results  which help us prove the desired lower bounds in our voting context.

5.1 Setup

In multi-party communication complexity  there are t computationally omnipotent players. Each
player i holds a private input Xi ∈ Xi. The input proﬁle is the vector (X1  . . .   Xt). The goal is to
compute the output of a function f : X1 × X2 × . . . × Xt → {0  1} on the input proﬁle.
A shared protocol Π speciﬁes how the players exchange information among themselves and with the
center. We use the blackboard model  in which messages written by one player are visible to all other
players. Let Π(X1  . . .   Xt) be the random variable denoting the message transcript generated when
all players follow the protocol on input proﬁle (X1  . . .   Xt); here  the randomness is due to coin
tosses by the players or the protocol. The communication cost of Π  denoted |Π|  is the maximum
length of Π(X1  . . .   Xt) over all input proﬁles (X1  . . .   Xt) and all coin tosses. Given δ ≥ 0  we
say that Π is a δ-error protocol for f if there exists a function Πout such that for every input proﬁle
(X1  . . .   Xt)  Pr [Πout(Π(X1  . . .   Xt)) = f (X1  . . .   Xt)] ≥ 1 − δ. The δ-error communication
complexity of f  denoted Rδ(f )  is the communication cost of the best δ-error protocol for f.

5.2 Multi-Party Fixed-Size Set-Disjointness

The main ingredient of our proof is a standard problem in multi-party communication complexity
called the multi-party set-disjointness problem  denoted DISJm t. Here  each player i holds an
arbitrary set Si from a universe of size m. The goal is to distinguish between two types of inputs.

• NO inputs: The sets are pairwise disjoint  i.e.  Si ∩ Sj = ∅ for all i (cid:54)= j.
• YES inputs: The sets have a unique element in common  but are otherwise pairwise disjoint 
i.e.  there exists x such that Si ∩ Sj = {x} for all i (cid:54)= j.

It is promised that the input will be one of these two types (in other words  the protocol is free
to choose any output on an input that does not satisfy this promise). Following a series of results
[35  36  37]  Gronemeier [38] and Jayram [39] ﬁnally established the optimal lower bound of Ω(m/t).
We introduce a variant of this problem  which we call multi-party ﬁxed-size set-disjointness and
denote FDISJm s t. It is almost identical to DISJm t  except that we know each player i holds a set
Si of a given size s. Our goal is to still determine whether the sets are pairwise disjoint (Si ∩ Sj = ∅
for all i (cid:54)= j) or pairwise uniquely intersecting (there exists x such that Si ∩ Sj = {x} for all i (cid:54)= j).
We use the lower bound on Rδ(DISJm t) to derive the following lower bound on Rδ(FDISJm s t).
Theorem 5. For a sufﬁciently small constant δ > 0 and m ≥ (3/2)st  Rδ(FDISJm s t) = Ω(s).

6For t = ω(1)  PREFTHRESHOLDt log m has distortion O(m/t) = o(m) and communication O(t log m).

5.3 Lower Bounds on the Communication Complexity of Voting Rules

We now use our lower bound on the δ-error communication complexity of FDISJm s t to derive a
lower bound on the communication complexity of a voting rule in terms of its distortion. We derive
different bounds depending on whether the elicitation rule of f is deterministic or randomized. For
randomized elicitation  our bound is weaker.
The key insight in the proof is that we can use a voting rule f with dist(f ) ≤ t/2 to construct a
δ-error protocol for solving FDISJm s t  and hence we can use the lower bound on Rδ(FDISJm s t)
from Theorem 5 to derive a lower bound on C(f ). At a high level  consider an instance (S1  . . .   St)
of FDISJm s t. We ask each player i to respond to the query of f according to an artiﬁcial valuation
function constructed using Si. We then use these responses to create an input for the aggregation rule
of f. We show that by asking each player an additional question about the alternative returned by the
aggregation rule  and possibly running this process a number of times  we can solve FDISJm s t.
Theorem 6. Consider a voting rule f with elicitation rule Πf and dist(f ) = d. If Πf is deterministic 

then C(f ) ≥ Ω(cid:0)m/d2(cid:1)  and if Πf is randomized  then C(f ) ≥ Ω(cid:0)m/d3(cid:1).

Finally  Table 1 summarizes our upper and lower bounds for some special cases. Achieving sublinear
distortion makes polynomial communication complexity both necessary (even with randomized
aggregation) and sufﬁcient (even with deterministic aggregation). If dist(f ) = O(log m)  our upper
and lower bounds differ by only polylogarithmic factors. And for constant distortion  they differ by
only a sublogarithmic factor.

6 Discussion

We initiated a formal study of the communication-distortion tradeoff in voting  but our work leaves
many open questions. The most immediate direction is to close the gap between our upper and
lower bounds. Regarding our upper bounds  both families of voting rules that we introduce —
PREFTHRESHOLD and RANDSUBSET — use deterministic aggregation  and we do not have better
upper bounds using randomized aggregation. Our lower bounds from Theorem 6 are also identical
for deterministic and randomized aggregation. This raises an elegant question: Can randomized
aggregation help? Also  using randomized elicitation in RANDSUBSET  we can achieve sublinear
distortion with communication complexity at most log m; Theorem 4 shows that this is not possible
with deterministic elicitation. This raises another elegant question: What is the best possible distortion
with randomized elicitation and communication complexity at most log m? It would also be interesting
to improve upon our lower bounds in Section 5  potentially by using a different problem from the
multi-party communication complexity literature.
Taking a broader viewpoint  we can consider more general forms of elicitation  like non-uniform
questions across voters  and questions adaptive to past responses. One can also explore the effect
of imposing other restrictions on the voting rule such as truthfulness [25  40]. On a conceptual
level  perhaps the main take-away message of our paper is that it pays off to elicit and aggregate
preferences “by any means necessary ” that is  potentially through highly nonstandard aggregation
and  especially  elicitation rules. In the setting of Caragiannis and Procaccia [11]  voters are software
agents  and this is natural. But when voters are people  it is crucial to understand the implications of
such unconventional approaches  both in terms of how communication complexity corresponds to
cognitive burden  and in terms of the interpretability and transparency of aggregation rules.
