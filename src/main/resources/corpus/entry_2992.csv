Introduction

Nonlinear data-ﬁtting problems are fundamental to many supervised learning tasks in signal process-

ing and machine learning. Given training data consisting of n pairs of input features xi∈ Rd and
desired outputs yi∈ R we wish to infer a function that best explains the training data. In this paper
we focus on ﬁtting Rectiﬁed Linear Units (ReLUs) to the data which are functions φw∶ Rd→ R of

the form

A natural approach to ﬁtting ReLUs to data is via minimizing the least-squares misﬁt aggregated over
the data. This optimization problem takes the form

withR∶ Rd→ R denoting a regularization function that encodes prior information on the weight

vector.
Fitting nonlinear models such as ReLUs have a rich history in statistics and learning theory [12]
with interesting new developments emerging [6] (we shall discuss all these results in greater detail in
Section 5). Most recently  nonlinear data ﬁtting problems in the form of neural networks (a.k.a. deep
learning) have emerged as powerful tools for automatically extracting interpretable and actionable
information from raw forms of data  leading to striking breakthroughs in a multitude of applications
[13  15  4]. In these and many other empirical domains it is common to use local search heuristics
such as gradient or stochastic gradient descent for nonlinear data ﬁtting. These local search heuristics
are surprisingly effective on real or randomly generated data. However  despite their empirical success
the reasons for their effectiveness remains mysterious.

Focusing on ﬁtting ReLUs  a-priori it is completely unclear why local search heuristics such as
gradient descent should converge for problems of the form (1.1)  as not only the regularization
function maybe nonconvex but also the loss function! Efﬁcient ﬁtting of ReLUs in this high-
dimensional setting poses new challenges: When are the iterates able to escape local optima and
saddle points and converge to global optima? How many samples do we need? How does the number
of samples depend on the a-priori prior knowledge available about the weights? What regularizer
is best suited to utilizing a particular form of prior knowledge? How many passes (or iterations) of
the algorithm is required to get to an accurate solution? At the heart of answering these questions is
the ability to predict convergence behavior/rate of (non)convex constrained optimization algorithms.
In this paper we build up on a new framework developed in the context of phase retrieval [21] for
analyzing nonconvex optimization problems to address such challenges.

We wish to characterize the rates of convergence for the projected gradient updates (3.2) as a function
of the number of samples  the available prior knowledge and the choice of the regularizer. To make
these connections precise and quantitative we need a few deﬁnitions. Naturally the required number

properties of the weight vector w. For example  if we know that the weight vector is approximately
sparse  naturally using an (cid:96)1 norm for the regularizer is superior to using an (cid:96)2 regularizer. To quantify
this capability we ﬁrst need a couple of standard deﬁnitions which we adapt from [17  18  21].

of samples for reliable data ﬁtting depends on how well the regularization functionR can capture the
Deﬁnition 2.1 (Descent set and cone) The set of descent of a functionR at a point w∗ is deﬁned as
DR(w
The cone of descent is deﬁned as a closed coneCR(w∗) that contains the descent set  i.e.DR(w∗)⊂
CR(w∗). The tangent cone is the conic hull of the descent set. That is  the smallest closed cone
CR(w∗) obeyingDR(w∗)⊂CR(w∗).
We note that the capability of the regularizerR in capturing the properties of the unknown weight
vector w∗ depends on the size of the descent coneCR(w∗). The smaller this cone is the more suited
the functionR is at capturing the properties of w∗. To quantify the size of this set we shall use the
Deﬁnition 2.2 (Gaussian width) The Gaussian width of a setC∈ Rd is deﬁned as:
where the expectation is taken over g∼N(0  Ip). Throughout we useBd~Sd−1 to denote the the unit
We now have all the deﬁnitions in place to quantify the capability of the functionR in capturing the
properties of the unknown parameter w∗. This naturally leads us to the deﬁnition of the minimum
Deﬁnition 2.3 (minimal number of samples) LetCR(w∗) be a cone of descent ofR at w∗. We
deﬁne the minimal sample function asM(R  w
We shall often use the short hand n0=M(R  w∗) with the dependence onR  w∗ implied.

We note that n0 is exactly the minimum number of samples required for structured signal recovery

the form yi=ai  w∗ if and only if n≥ n0.1 While this result is only known to be true for convex
compared to linear observations) we can not hope to recover the weight vector from n≤ n0 when

regularization functions we believe that n0 also characterizes the minimal number of samples even for
nonconvex regularizers in (2.1). See [17] for some results in the nonconvex case as well as the role
this quantity plays in the computational complexity of projected gradient schemes for linear inverse
problems. Given that with nonlinear samples we have less information (we loose some information

using (1.1). Therefore  we can use n0 as a lower-bound on the minimum number of observations
required for projected gradient descent iterations (3.2) to succeed at ﬁnding the right model.

3 Theoretical results for learning ReLUs

A simple heuristic for optimizing (1.1) is to use gradient descent. One challenging aspect of the
above loss function is that it is not differentiable and it is not clear how to run projected gradient
descent. However  this does not pose a fundamental challenge as the loss function is differentiable
except for isolated points and we can use the notion of generalized gradients to deﬁne the gradient at
a non-differentiable point as one of the limit points of the gradient in a local neighborhood of the
non-differentiable point. For the loss in (1.1) the generalized gradient takes the form

∇L(w)∶= 1

(ReLU(w  xi)− yi)(1+ sgn(w  xi)) xi.

Therefore  projected gradient descent takes the form

Theorem 3.1 Let w∗ ∈ Rd be an arbitrary weight vector andR∶ Rd → R be a proper function
(convex or nonconvex). Suppose the feature vectors xi ∈ Rd are i.i.d. Gaussian random vectors
distributed asN(0  I) with the corresponding labels given by
yi= max(0 xi  w

To estimate w∗  we start from the initial point w0= 0 and apply the Projected Gradient Descent
wτ+1=PK(wτ− µτ∇L(wτ))  
withK∶={w∈ Rd∶ R(w)≤R(w∗)} and∇L deﬁned via (3.1). Also set the learning parameter
sequence to µ0= 2 and µτ = 1 for all τ= 1  2  . . . and let n0=M(R  w∗)  per Deﬁnition 2.3  be

The ﬁrst interesting and perhaps surprising aspect of this result is its generality: it applies not only to
convex regularization functions but also nonconvex ones! As we mentioned earlier the optimization
problem in (1.1) is not known to be tractable even for convex regularizers. Despite the nonconvexity
of both the objective and regularizer  the theorem above shows that with a near minimal number

more precise characterization is φ−1(ω2(CR(w∗)∩Bd))≈ ω2(CR(w∗)∩Bd) where φ(t)=√

In this section we carry out a simple numerical experiment to corroborate our theoretical results. For

this purpose we generate a unit norm sparse vector w∗∈ Rd of dimension d= 1000 containing s=
d~50 non-zero entries. We also generate a random feature matrix X∈ Rn×d with n=æ8s log(d~s)æ
and containing i.i.d.N(0  1) entries. We now take two sets of observations of size n from θ∗:

to the ground truth. This ﬁgure also clearly demonstrates that the behavior of the PGD iterates
applied to both models are similar  further corroborating the results of Theorem 3.1. We note that

the sample complexity used in this simulation is 8s log(n~s) which is a constant factor away from
n0∝ s log(n~s) conﬁrming our assertion that the required sample complexity is a constant factor

away from n0 (as predicted by Theorem 3.1).

5 Discussions and prior art

There is a large body of work on learning nonlinear models. A particular class of such problems
that have been studied are the so called idealized Single Index Models (SIMs) [9  10]. In these

problems the inputs are labeled examples{(xi  yi)}n
i=1∈ Rd× R which are guaranteed to satisfy
yi= f(w  xi) for some w∈ Rd and nondecreasing (Lipchitz continuous) f∶ R→ R. The goal in

this problem is to ﬁnd a (nearly) accurate such f and w. An interesting polynomial-time algorithm
called the Isotron exists for this problem [12  11]. In principle  this approach can also be used to
ﬁt ReLUs. However  these results differ from ours in term of both assumptions and results. On the
one had  the assumptions are slightly more restrictive as they require bounded features xi  outputs
yi and weights. On the other hand  these result hold for much more general distributions and more
general models than the realizable model studied in this paper. These results also do not apply in the
high dimensional regime where the number of observations is signiﬁcantly smaller than the number
of parameters (see [5] for some results in this direction). In the realizable case  the Isotron result

requireO( 1
) iterations to achieve  error in objective value. In comparison  our results guarantee
convergence to a solution with relative error  (wτ− w∗(cid:96)2~w∗(cid:96)2≤ ) after log(1~) iterations.
an accuracy of  the algorithm runs in poly(1~) time. In comparison  as mentioned earlier our result
rquires log(1~) iterations for reliable parameter estimation. We note however we study the problem
that with two hidden unites (k= 2) there are no critical points for conﬁgurations where both weight

in different settings and a direct comparison is not possible between the two results.
We would like to note that there is an interesting growing literature on learning shallow neural
networks with a single hidden layer with i.i.d. inputs  and under a realizable model (i.e. the labels are
generated from a network with planted weights) [23  2  25]. For isotropic Gaussian inputs  [23] shows

Focusing on the speciﬁc case of ReLU functions  an interesting recent result [6] shows that reliable
learning of ReLUs is possible under very general but bounded distributional assumptions. To achieve

vectors fall into (or outside) the cone of ground truth weights. With the same assumptions  [2] proves
that for a single-hidden ReLU network with a single non-overlapping convolutional ﬁlter  all local
minimizers of the population loss are global; they also give counter-examples in the overlapping case
and prove the problem is NP-hard when inputs are not Gaussian. [25] studies general single-hidden
layer networks and shows that a version of gradient descent which uses a fresh batch of samples in
each iteration converges to the planted model. This holds using an initialization obtained via a tensor
decomposition method. Our approach and convergence results differ from this literature in a variety
of different ways. First  we focus on zero hidden layers with a regularization term. Some of this
literature focuses on one-hidden layers without (or with speciﬁc) regularization. Second  unlike some
of these results such as [2  14]  we study the optimization properties of the empirical function  not its
expected value. Third  we initialize at zero in lieu of sophisticated initialization schemes. Finally 
our framework does not require a fresh batch of samples per new gradient iteration as in [25]. We
also note that several publications study the effect of over-parametrization on the training of neural
networks without any regularization [19  8  16  22]. Therefore  the global optima are not unique
and hence the solutions may not generalize. In comparison we study the problem with an arbitrary
regularization which allows for a unique global optima.
