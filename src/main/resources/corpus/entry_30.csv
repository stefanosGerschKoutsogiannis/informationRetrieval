Abstract 

Contrast statistics of the  majority  of natural  images  conform to  a Weibull  distri(cid:173)
bution.  This  property  of natural  images  may  facilitate  efficient  and  very  rapid 
extraction of a scene's visual gist.  Here we investigated whether a neural response 
model  based on  the Wei bull contrast distribution captures visual  information that 
humans  use  to  rapidly identify natural  scenes.  In a learning phase   we  measured 
EEG  activity  of 32  subjects  viewing  brief flashes  of 700 natural  scenes.  From 
these neural measurements and the contrast statistics of the natural image stimuli  
we derived an  across subject Wei bull response model.  We used this model to pre(cid:173)
dict the EEG responses to  100 new natural scenes and estimated which scene the 
subject viewed by  finding  the best match between the model  predictions  and the 
observed EEG responses.  In almost 90 percent of the cases our model accurately 
predicted the observed scene.  Moreover  in most failed cases  the scene mistaken 
for the observed scene was visually similar to the observed scene itself.  Similar re(cid:173)
sults were obtained in a separate experiment in which 16 other subjects where pre(cid:173)
sented with artificial  occlusion models of natural  images.  Together   these results 
suggest that Weibull  contrast statistics  of natural  images contain a  considerable 
amount of visual gist information to warrant rapid image identification. 

1  Introduction 

Natural images  although apparently diverse  have a surprisingly regular statistical regularity.  There 
is  a strong correlation between adjacent image points in terms of local features  such as  luminance 
[1].  These second-order correlations decrease with distance between image points  giving rise to the 
typical  1/12 power spectra of natural images.  On account of this power-law characteristic  natural 
images compromise a very small and distinguishable subset of the space of all possible images  with 
specific scene categories occupying different parts of this subspace. For example  white noise images 
can be distinguished from  natural images because of their deviation from  the power law statistics  
while street scenes  and beach scenes  can be separated from  each  other on  the basis  of differences 
in ensemble power spectra [2].  Thus  the power spectra of natural images contain an indeterminate 
amount of the visual gist of these images. 

The similarity structure among nearby image points  however  represents only part of the statistical 
structure in natural images.  There  are  also  higher-order correlations  which introduce structure in 
the phase spectra of natural images.  This structure is assumed to carry perceptually important image 
features  such  as  edges  and  has  been  measured  in  terms  of kurtosis  in  the  contrast distribution  of 
natural  images  [3   4   5].  Geusebroek  and  Smeulders  [6]  showed  that  the  two-parameter Weibull 
distribution adequately captures the variance and kurtosis in the contrast distribution of the majority 
of natural images.  In fact  the two parameters of the Weibull contrast distribution tum out to organize 
the space of all possible natural scenes in a perceptually meaningful manner [7]  and thus are likely 
to provide additional information about a scene's visual gist. 

Scholte et al.  [7]  have further  shown that the  two  parameters  of the  Weibull  contrast distribution 
match biologically realistic computations of Lateral  Geniculate Nucleus (LGN) cells.  Specifically  
they simulated X-cell responses by filtering images with a difference of Gaussians (DoG)  rectifying 
the  filtered  images  and  transforming  the  pixel  values  of the resulting  images  with  a contrast gain 
function adequate for P-cells.  To simulate Y-cell responses  the rectified images were passed through 
a  Gaussian  smoothing  function  and  resulting  pixel  values  were  subsequently  transformed  with  a 
contrast gain function  adequate for M-cells.  The sum of the resulting X-cell responses  turned out 
to  correlate  highly  with  one Wei bull  parameter (r=0.95)   whereas  the  sum  of the  resulting  Y-cell 
responses correlated highly  with  the  other Weibull  parameter (r=0.70).  Moreover  the two Wei bull 
parameters  correlated  highly  with  EEG  activity  (r2=0.5)  at  the  occipital  part  of the  brain.  The 
findings  of Scholte et al.  [7]  show  that our brain is  capable of approximating the Wei bull  contrast 
distribution of an image on the basis of filters  that are biologically realistic in  shape  sensitivity  and 
SIze. 

Here we hypothesized that if Wei bull contrast distributions of natural images carry perceptually im(cid:173)
portant information  a neural response model based on the Weibull contrast distribution will predict 
brain responses to brief flashes of natural images.  We tested this hypothesis with two experiments in 
which we rapidly presented a large set of natural or artificial images to multiple subjects while mea(cid:173)
suring EEG activity across the entire cortex.  In each experiment   we  constructed a neural response 
model from the Weibull statistics of the presented images  and corresponding EEG data   which we 
then  applied to  predict EEG  responses to  a new  collection of natural  or artificial  images.  To  vali(cid:173)
date the constructed neural response models  we used the approach of Kay et al.  [8]:  predicted and 
measured EEG responses  were compared to  determine  whether the  observed image was  correctly 
identified. 

2  Methods 

We  first  describe how  we  filter  images  locally  with  a set of biologically-realistic filters.  Then we 
address a local contrast response selection mechanism with which we construct a contrast magnitude 
map for  a given  input image (a detailed description is  in  submission  [12]).  Subsequently   Weibull 
contrast statistics are estimated from such maps and the relation between image statistics and neural 
activity  modeled.  The section ends with an explanation of a performance measure for EEG-based 
image identification. 

2.1  Local contrasts values in natural images 

As  in  [7]   we  use  contrast filters  that have  spatial  characteristics  and contrast response properties 
closely  mirroring well-known  characteristic receptive-fields  of LGN neurons  [9].  Specifically   we 
use  a  bank of second-order Gaussian  derivative  filters  that  span  multiple  octaves  in  spatial  scale  
that have peak sensitivity approximately inverse to  filter  size and that have contrast gain properties 
independent of size.  We represent contrast gain using an established non-linear response model that 
divides input contrast by the sum of the input and a semi-saturation constant [10].  In this model a low 
value of the semi-saturation parameter indicates high non-linear contrast gain whereas higher values 
result in  a linear mapping  and  thus  will  not  lead to  saturation.  Given  an  image   we  process  each 
image location with a bank of 5 contrast filters covering 5 octaves in spatial scale and  subsequently  
subject the  output of each scale-tuned filter  to  5 different gain controls  (5  semi-saturation values). 
This results  for each image location  in 25 contrast response values. 

We  applied each  of the 5 scale-specific filters   combined with  each of the 5 contrast gain controls  
to  800 natural images.  Figure  1 shows average responses over all image locations.  Contrast is  high 
at  small  scale  and  low  semi-saturation.  It decreases  exponentially  with  scale  owing  to  the  peak 
sensitivity of the filters   which is inversely related to spatial scale.  That contrast also decreases with 
semi-saturation is  explained by  the  fact  that the amount of contrast suppression is  proportional  to 
the  semi-saturation  value.  From  these  summary  statistics  it  follows  that   although  natural  image 
contrast varies  considerable within  and  across  scale and contrast gain   the fast  majority  of natural 
image contrasts  falls  above  a lower threshold.  It is  reasonable  to  assume  that the  LGN considers 
contrast below  this  statistical  threshold  as  noise  and  only  processes  contrasts  above  it   i.e.  only 
processes reliable contrast outputs.

blue-yellow (middle) and red-green  (right) color components of 800 natural images. 

2.2  Natural image statistics-based selection of unique local image contrast values 

What spatial scale and contrast gain does the LGN use to process local image contrast? It is unlikely 
that the LGN (linearly)  integrates the  output of a population  of spatially  overlapping  filters  to  de(cid:173)
termine local image contrast as  this would make it sensitive to receptive field  clutter [II].  Here we 
depart from the view that LGN aims to minimize receptive clutter by selecting a single output from a 
population of scale and gain specific contrast filters  [12].  Specifically  in order to determine contrast 
at  an  image location  we  apply  the  smallest filter  with  boosted  contrast output above  what can  be 
expected to be noise for that particular filter.  We define local contrast as  the amount of contrast ex(cid:173)
ceeding the noise threshold  which for a given scale and gain is set here to half standard deviation of 
contrasts in 800 natural images (see figure  1).  This contrast response selection mechanism produces 
a contrast magnitude map in ways similar to the scale selection model in  [13]. 

We  apply  the local contrast selection mechanism separately  to  the individual color components of 
an  image.  From  a single color image  the three color components are extracted using the Gaussian 
color model  [14]   resulting in a gray-scale  blue-yellow and red-green image representations.  Each 
of these representations is convolved with the  25  scale and gain specific contrast filters  and subse(cid:173)
quently subjected to our local contrast selection mechanism. For each color component a dedicated 
scale and gain dependent noise threshold is used (see figure  I).  As a result  for each color image we 
get three contrast magnitude maps   which we  linearly sum to  arrive  at a single contrast magnitude 
map. 

2.3  Weibull statistics of local image contrast 

The contrast magnitude map of an image is summarized in a histogram  representing the distribution 
of local contrast values of that image.  Note that the histogram does not preserve information about 
spatial structure in the contrast magnitude map:  a scrambling the contrast magnitude map will not 
affect  the  histogram.  We  subsequently  fit  a  three-parameter  Weibull  distribution  to  the  contrast 
histogram.  The three-parameter Wei bull distribution is given by 

f(x) = cexpc';tY 

(I) 

The  parameters  of this  distribution  are  indicative  for  the  spatial  structure  in  a  natural  scene  (see 
figure 2) and can be put in a biologically plausible framework [7].  The scale parameter f3  describes 
the width of the histogram.  Hence  it varies roughly with the variation in local image contrasts. The 
shape parameter y  describes the shape of the histogram.  It varies  with the amount of scene clutter. 
The  J1  parameter   represents  the  origin  of the  distribution.  Its  position  is  influenced  by  uneven 
illumination.  The  three  Weibull  parameters  are  estimated  using  a  maximum  likelihood estimator 
(MLE). To achieve illumination invariance  the J1  parameter is normalized out.

the eagle  against a highly  uniform background.  The image gradient at each image location shows the contrast 
strength.  All  gradients  accumulated  in  a histogram  reveal  the  distribution  of local  contrasts.  The  scale  and 
shape parameters of the Weibull distribution are estimated from the fit to the histogram by maximum likelihood 
estimation. 

2.4  Model Estimation 

We  use  EEG response  signals  from  C  channels  (electrodes)  covering the entire cortex   to develop 
a  Wei bull  response  model  that  predicts  neuronal  responses  to  natural  images.  EEG  signals  are 
measured for S  subjects  watching N  natural images.  We  average  these  signals  across  subjects  to 
obtain  a more robust response signal  per channel  and per image.  This results  in  an  N  x C  matrix 
F(t)  of response  signals  fne(t).  We  construct  a  linear  Wei bull  response  model  for  each  channel 
separately.  Our rationale for combining the two Weibull parameters in a linear fashion is that these 
two  parameters can  be  suitably extracted from  the X  and Y  units  in  the LGN model  (as  shown in 
Scholte et al  [7]) and as such the linear combination reflects linear pooling at the LGN level. 

Functional data analysis [15] provides a natural framework for modeling continuous stochastic brain 
processes. We use a point-wise multivariate functional linear model to establish the relation between 
Weibull  parameters  X  =  [ 81   ...  i3N;YI  ··· YNf and the EEG response  feCt)  =  Line  ...  jNeF.  The

Image Identification 

How  well  does the Wei bull  response model  predict EEG responses  to  natural  images?  We  answer 
this question in terms of EEG-based identification of individual images.  Given a set of M  new im(cid:173)
ages and their Weibull parameters Y  the Weibull response model provides the EEG prediction ge(t). 
The match  between  prediction  ge(t)  and  true   measured EEG  activity  ge(t)  =  [gl  ...  gM] provides 
a means for image identification.  More specifically   an  M  X  M  similarity matrix S is constructed  
where each  element contains  the  Pearson's correlation  coefficient R  between  measured gem(t)  and 
predicted  gcm(t)  response.  The  similarity  matrix  shows  for  each  individual  image   the  amount  of 
EEG correlation with  the  other images.  The image whose predicted activity pattern is most corre(cid:173)
lated  with  the  measured  activity  pattern  is  selected.  A  similarity  matrix  is  constructed separately 
for  each  of the  C  channels.  These  similarity  matrices  are  squared  in  order to  allow  averaging  of 
similarity matrices across channels.  Hence  the square of the correlation coefficient r2  rather than r 
itself is used as  a measure of similarity between true and predicted response. 

3  Experiments and Results 

3.1  Stimulus and EEG Data 

In  our experiments  we  used  800  color images  with  a resolution  345  x  217  pixels  and  a bit-depth 
of 24.  Of these   400  were pictures  of animals  in  their natural  habitat and  400 pictures  of natural 
landscapes   city  scenes   indoor  scenes  and  man-made  objects.  These  images  were  taken  from  a 
larger set of images  used  in  Fabre-Thorpe [16].  This  subset of images was  reasonably  balanced in 
terms of Michelson contrast  spatial frequency and orientation properties.  The Weibull properties of 
these images nevertheless covered a wide range of real-world images.  The data set did not contain 
near duplicates. 

The images  were presented to  32 subjects on  a  19" I1yama  monitor with  a resolution of 1024*768 
pixels  and  a frame-rate  of 100  Hz.  Subjects  were  seated 90  cm from  the  monitor.  During  EEG 
acquisition  a  stimulus  was  presented   on  average  every  1500  ms  (range  1000-2000  ms)  for  100 
ms.  Each  stimulus was  presented 2 times for a total  of 1600 presentations.  Recordings were  made 
with a Biosemi 52-channel Active Two EEG system (Biosemi Instrumentation BV  Amsterdam  The 
Netherlands).  Data was  sampled at 256 Hz.  Data analysis was identical to  [17]  with the exception 
that the high-pass  filter  was  placed at 0.1  Hz  (12  db/octave)  and  the pre-stimulus baseline activity 
was taken between -100 and 0 ms with regard to  stimulus onset.  Trials were averaged over subject 
per individual stimulus resulting in 800 averages of 20 to  32 averages per individual image. 

3.2  Experiments 

The experiments  were  carried  out with  the  following  parameters settings.  Two  banks  of Gaussian 
second-order derivative filters  were used to  determine image contrast for each image location.  The 
first  set consisted of filters  with octave spatial  scales  1.5   3   6   12   24  (std.  in  pixels).  This  set was 
used  to  determine  the  Wei bull  scale  parameter [3.  The  other filter  bank   with  scales  3   6   12   24  
48   was  used  for  the  estimation  of Wei bull  shape  parameter y.  The  spatial  properties  of the  two 
sets were determined experimentally and roughly correspond to receptive field sizes of small X and 
large Y Ganglion cells in the early visual system of the human brain [18].  We used 5 semi-saturation 
constants between 0.15 and  1.6 to cover the spectrum from linear to non-linear contrast gain control 
in the LGN. 

A cross validation study was performed to obtain reliable performance measurements.  We repeated 
the same experiment 50 times  each time randomly  selecting 700 images for model estimation and 
100 images for image identification.  Performance was measured in terms of the percentage of cor(cid:173)
rectly  identified  images  for  each  of the  50  experiments.  The 50 measures  were  then  averaged  to

Figure  3:  Total  explained  variance  in  ERP  signals  by  the  two  Wei bull  parameters.  The  peak  of 
the  total  explained variance is  highest  (75  percent)  for  the  IZ electrode  overlying  the  early  visual

arrive  at  a  single  performance  outcome.  Hence   accuracy  was  defined  as  the  fraction  of images 
for  which  the predicted activity  pattern  and measured activity  pattern produced the  highest r2.  As 
accuracy  does  not reflect how  close  the  correct image  was  to  being  selected   we  also  ranked  the 
correlation coefficients and determined within which percentage of the ranked M images the correct 
one was. 

3.3  Results 

We first present correlations between ERP signals from across the entire brain and the two parame(cid:173)
ters of the Weibull fit  to the sum  of selected local contrast values in the gray-level  blue-yellow and 
red-green components of each image.  Correlations are strikingly high  at electrode Iz overlying the 
early visual cortex.  The peak r2  (square of the correlation coefficient) over time for that electrode is 
75  percent (r =  0.8691;  p =  0).  The peak r2  over time slowly decays away  from  the occipital part 
of the head as  can  be  seen from  the topographic plots in  figure  3.  The Wei bull  parameters explain 
most variance in the ERP signal very early in visual processing  at  113  ms  after stimulus  onset (3) 
and continue to explain variance up to about 200 ms. This suggests that the two Wei bull parameters 
are probably only relevant to the brain in the early phases of visual processing. 

Accuracy results are shown in figure  4.  The topographic plots  show image identification accuracy 
for  single  channels  (electrodes).  Channel  IZ  produces  the  highest accuracy  with  5 percent.  This 
means  that based  on  ERP signal  at the IZ electrode  5 out of 100 images  are  on  average correctly 
identified from  the  similarity  matrix.  Then follow  channel Oz  with 4.3  percent   02 with 4.1  and 
so  on.  Image identification based on  multiple channels strikingly improves performance as  shown 
in  figure  4.  When  the  similarity  matrices  from  the  20  most  contributive  channels  are  averaged  
accuracy of almost 90 percent is obtained.  This means that   with a Wei bull  response model of only 
two  parameters   almost  every  image  can  be  correctly  identified  from  the  neural  activity  that  this 
image  triggers.  As  an  aside  we  note  that  this  implies  that  the  different  parts  of the  early  visual 
system process different types of images (in terms of the two Wei bull parameters) in different ways. 

To  test  the  individual  contribution  of the  Weibull  parameters   we  performed principal  component 
analysis on the beta and gamma parameters and used the principal component scores separately for 
image identification.  A Weibull response model based only on one of the two principal component 
scores performs significantly less  as  can be seen in figure  4.  Moreover   there is large difference in 
accuracy  performance  between  the  two  projected  Wei bull  parameters.  These  results  demonstrate

that the  two Weibull parameters indeed capture two  different perceptual aspects  of natural  scenes  
which together constitutes an important part of early neural processing of natural images. 

Accuracy results in figure  4  only  show  how often the correct image is ranked first   not where it is 
ranked.  We therefore analyzed the image rankings (data not shown).  For the first most contributive 
channel  (41)   the  correct image  is  always  ranked  within  the  top  13  percent  of the  images.  The 
ranking slightly worsens (top  15  percent) for the second most contributive channel (Oz) and for the 
third  (02   top  16  percent).  From  the  fourth  channel  and  beyond  there  is  a clear but steady  drop 
in ranking.  The ranking data  show  an  overall pattern similar to  the  one seen in  the  accuracy  data 
and  indicate that   even  in  cases  where an  image is  not correctly  identified   the  misidentification  is 
limited. 

When does identification fail? We extracted frequently confused image pairs from all similarity ma(cid:173)
trices of all  50 cross validation steps for all 64 channels.  These image pairs reveal that identification 
errors tend to occur when the selected image is visually similar to the correct image.  The upper row 
of figure  5 shows 4 images from  our data set and the images with which these have been confused 
frequently.  The first set of 2 images  containing grazing cows and a packed donkey  have been con(cid:173)
fused 6 times across  the  50 cross  validation experiments  the  second   and third set 5 times and the 
fourth  set 4  times.  The overall  similarity between the confused images is  evident and remarkable 
considering  the  variety  of images  we  have  used.  These  findings  suggest  that  the  Wei bull  model 
captures aspect of a scene's visual gist that the brain possibly uses for perception at a glance. 

We  further  scrutinized  image  identification  performance  on  occlusion  models  of natural  images. 
Following  [19]   we created 24 types of dead leave images containing disks  of various sizes  (large  
medium and small)   size distributions (Power law and exponential)  intensities (equal intensity ver(cid:173)
sus  decaying intensity)  and  opacities  (occluding  versus  transparent).  For each image type   16 in(cid:173)
stances were composed resulting in a total of 384 dead leave images. We presented 16 subjects with 
the 384 dead leaves images while recording their EEG activity.  As with our natural images  the beta 
and  gamma parameter  values  of the  Weibull  contrast distributions  underlying  the  364  dead  leave 
images correlated highly with EEG activity (r2  =  0.83).  A cross validation experiment in which we 
used 284 dead leaves images for building a Wei bull  response model  and  100 for image identifica(cid:173)
tion resulted in an average image identification performance of 94 percent (see figure 4).  Confusion 
analysis revealed that dead leave images with clear disks were well identified  whereas dead leaves 
images composed of transparent and thus  indistinguishable disks  were confused frequently  (figure

pairs is also apparent:  except for the fourth pair  they are all  images with transparent disk (but with 
different disk  sizes  and  disk intensity patterns).  Dead leave images  with  small   opaque  and  equal 
intensity disks (as in the lower right example) were least confused.

clear object-background differences. 

4  Discussion and Conclusion 

To determine local image contrasts  we have applied a bank of biologically-motivated contrast filters 
to  each image location and selected a single filter output based on receptive field size and response 
reliability.  The statistics of locally selected image contrasts   appropriately captured by  the Weibull 
distribution   explain  up  to  75  percent of occipital  EEG activity  for  natural  images  and  almost  83 
for artificial dead leave images.  We have used Wei bull contrast statistics of these images and corre(cid:173)
sponding EEG activity to construct a Weibull response model for EEG-based rapid image identifica(cid:173)
tion.  Using this model  we have obtained image identification performance of 90 percent for natural 
images and 94 percent for dead leave images  which is remarkable considering the simplicity of the 
two-parameter Weibull  image  model  and  the  limited  spatial  resolution  of EEG data.  We  attribute 
this  success  to  the  ability  of the  Weibull  parameters  to  structure  the  space  of natural  images  in  a 
highly meaningful and compact way  invariant to a large class of accidental or trivial scene features. 
Both the scale and shape parameters contribute to the meaningful organization of natural images and 
appear to play an important role in the early neural processing of natural images. 

Kay et.  al  [8]  report similar image identification performance using an  other biologically plausible 
model.  In  this  model   a natural image is  represented by  a large set of Gabor wavelets differing  in 
size   position   orientation   spatial  frequency  and phase.  Haemodynaymic  responses  in  the  visual 
cortex  are  integrally  modeled  as  a  linear function  of the  contrast energy  contained  in  quadrature 
wavelet pairs.  In  a repeated trial experiment involving  1700 training images   120 test images   and 
fMRI data of 2 subjects  92 percent of the test images were correctly identified for one subject and 72 
for a second subject.  In  a single trial experiment   the reported performances are 52 and 31  percent 
respectively.  We  note  that  in  contrast  to  [8]   our  neural  response  model  is  based  on  (summary) 
statistics  of filter  outputs   rather  than  on  filter  outputs  themselves.  This  may  explain  our  models 
ability to compactly describe a scene's visual gist. 

In  conclusion   we  embrace the view  that common factors  of natural  images imprinted in  the brain 
daily   underlie  rapid  image  identification  by  humans.  Departing  from  this  view   we  establish  a 
relationship  between  natural  image  statistics  and  neural processing  through  the  Weibull  response 
model.  Results  with  EEG-based  image identification  using  the  Wei bull  response  model   together 
with  the  biological  plausibility  of the  Weibull  response  model   supports  the  idea  that  the  human 
visual  system evolved   among others   to  estimate the Weibull statistics  of natural images  for rapid 
extraction of their visual gist [7].
