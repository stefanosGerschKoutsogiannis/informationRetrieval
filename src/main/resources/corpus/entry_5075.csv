Abstract

We introduce a solid harmonic wavelet scattering representation  invariant to
rigid motion and stable to deformations  for regression and classiﬁcation of 2D
and 3D signals. Solid harmonic wavelets are computed by multiplying solid
harmonic functions with Gaussian windows dilated at different scales. Invariant
scattering coefﬁcients are obtained by cascading such wavelet transforms with
the complex modulus nonlinearity. We study an application of solid harmonic
scattering invariants to the estimation of quantum molecular energies  which are
also invariant to rigid motion and stable with respect to deformations. A multilinear
regression over scattering invariants provides close to state of the art results over
small and large databases of organic molecules.

Introduction

Deep convolutional neural networks provide state of the art results over most classiﬁcation and
regression problems when there is enough training data. The convolutional architecture builds a
representation which translates when the input is translated. It can compute invariants to translations
with a global spatial pooling operator such as averaging or max pooling. A major issue is to understand
if one can reduce the amount of training data  by reﬁning the architecture or specifying network
weights  from prior information on the classiﬁcation or regression problem. Beyond translation
invariance  such prior information can be provided by invariance over other known groups of
transformations.
This paper studies the construction of generic translation and rotation invariant representations for
any 2D and 3D signals  and their application. Rotation invariant representations have been developed
for 2D images  for instance in [20]  where a descriptor based on oriented wavelets was used to create
a jointly translation and rotation-invariant representation of texture images which retained all identity
information necessary for classiﬁcation. These representations have not been extended to 3D because

an oriented wavelet representation in 3D requires covering the unit sphere instead of the unit circle
leading to much heavier computational requirements.
Section 2 introduces a 2D or 3D rotation invariant representation calculated with a cascade of
convolutions with spherical harmonic wavelets  and modulus non-linearities. Invariance to rotations
results from speciﬁc properties of spherical harmonics  which leads to efﬁcient computations. A
wavelet scattering can be implemented as a deep convolutional network where all ﬁlters are predeﬁned
by the wavelet choice [13]. In that case  prior information on invariants fully speciﬁes the network
weights. Besides translation and rotation invariance  such scattering representations linearize small
deformations. Invariants to small deformations are thus obtained with linear operators applied to
scattering coefﬁcients  and scattering coefﬁcients can provide accurate regressions of functions which
are stable to deformations.
Translation and rotation invariance is often encountered in physical functionals. For example energies
of isolated physical systems are usually translation and rotation invariant  and are stable to small
deformations. This paper concentrates on applications to computations of quantum energies of organic
molecules. Computing the energy of a molecule given the charges and the relative positions of the
nuclei is a fundamental topic in computational chemistry. It has considerable industrial applications 
for example to test and design materials or pharmaceuticals [4]. Density functional theory is currently
the most efﬁcient numerical technique to compute approximate values of quantum energies  but it
requires considerable amounts of calculations which limit the size of molecules and the number
of tests. Machine learning methods have gained traction to estimate quantum molecular energies
from existing quantum chemistry databases  because they require much less computation time after
training.
State of the art learning approaches have been adapted to the speciﬁcities of the underlying physics.
Best results on large databases are obtained with deep neural networks whose architectures are
tailored to this quantum chemistry problem. Numerical experiments in Section 4 show that applying
a standard multilinear regression on our generic 3D invariant solid harmonic scattering representation
yields nearly state of the art results compared to all methods  including deep neural networks  and on
both small and large databases.

2 Solid harmonic wavelet scattering

Wavelet scattering transforms have been introduced to deﬁne representations which are invariant
to translations and Lipschitz continuous to deformations [12]. In two dimensions they have been
extended to deﬁne rotationally invariant representations [20] but in 3D this approach requires covering
the unit sphere with multiple oriented wavelets (as opposed to the unit circle in 2D)  which requires
too much computation. This section introduces a solid harmonic wavelet scattering transform whose
rotation invariance results from symmetries of solid harmonics. In contrast to oriented wavelets 
every solid harmonic wavelet can yield its own rotation invariant descriptor because it operates in a
rotational frequency space.

2.1 Solid harmonics in 2D and 3D

Solid harmonics are solutions of the Laplace equation ∆f = 0  usually expressed in spherical coordi-
nates  where the Laplacian is the sum of unmixed second derivatives. In 2D  interpreting R2 as the
complex plane  we ﬁnd that z (cid:55)→ z(cid:96) is a solution for all (cid:96) ∈ N due to its holomorphicity1. Expressing
this solution in polar coordinates gives (r  ϕ) (cid:55)→ r(cid:96)ei(cid:96)ϕ  revealing an (cid:96)th- order polynomial in radius
and a so-called circular harmonic with (cid:96) angular oscillations per circle.
Solving the Laplace equation in 3D spherical coordinates (r  ϑ  ϕ) gives rise to spherical harmonics 
the eigenvectors of the Laplacian on the sphere. Imposing separability of azimuthal and elevation
contributions yields the functions Y m
is an associated
  for (cid:96) ≥ 0 and −(cid:96) ≤ m ≤ (cid:96). They form an
Legendre polynomial and C((cid:96)  m) =
orthogonal basis of L2 functions on the sphere. Analogously to the 2D case  3D solid harmonics are

(cid:113) (2(cid:96)+1)((cid:96)−m)!

4π((cid:96)+m)!

(cid:96) (ϑ  ϕ) = C((cid:96)  m)P m

(cid:96) (cos ϑ)eimϕ  where P m

(cid:96)

1Real and imaginary parts of holomorphic functions are harmonic - their Laplacian is 0

2(cid:96) + 1

(r  ϑ  ϕ) (cid:55)→

r(cid:96)Y m

(cid:96) (ϑ  ϕ).

We now deﬁne solid harmonic wavelets in 2D and 3D. A wavelet ψ(u) is a spatial ﬁlter with zero
sum  which is localized around the origin in the sense that it has a fast decay along (cid:107)u(cid:107). Let
ψj(u) = 2−djψ(2−ju) be a normalized dilation of ψ by 2j in dimension d. A multiscale wavelet
transform of a signal ρ(u) computes convolutions with these dilated wavelets at all scales 2j to obtain
the set of wavelet coefﬁcients {ρ (cid:63) ψj(u)}j∈Z . They are translation covariant. Let us denote by ˆρ(ω)
the Fourier transform of ρ(u). The Fourier transforms of these convolutions are ˆρ(ω) ˆψ(2jω)  which
yields fast computational algorithms using FFTs.
A wavelet is deﬁned from a solid harmonic by multiplying it by a Gaussian  which localizes its
support. In the 2D case we obtain the following family of wavelets:

ψ(cid:96)(r  ϕ) =

e− 1

2 r2

r(cid:96) ei(cid:96)ϕ.

1(cid:112)(2π)2

For (cid:96) > 0  these functions have zero integrals and are localized around the origin. In 2D frequency
polar coordinates ω = λ (cos α  sin α)T   one can verify that the Fourier transform of this solid
harmonic wavelet is very similar to itself in signal space: ˆψ(cid:96)(λ  α) = (−i)(cid:96) e− 1
2 λ2
λ(cid:96) ei(cid:96)α. The solid
harmonic wavelet transform inherits the rotation properties of the solid harmonics.
In 2D  the rotation of a solid harmonic incurs a complex phase shift. Let Rγ ∈ SO(2) be a rotation
of angle γ. We ﬁrst observe that

Rγψj (cid:96)(r  ϕ) = ψj (cid:96)(r  ϕ − γ) = e−ilγψ(r  ϕ).

One can derive that rotating a signal ρ produces the same rotation on its wavelet convolution 
multiplied by a phase factor encoding the rotational angle: Rγρ (cid:63) ψj (cid:96)(u) = eilγRγ(ρ (cid:63) ψj (cid:96))(u).
If we eliminate the phase with a modulus U [j  (cid:96)]ρ(u) = |ρ (cid:63) ψj (cid:96)(u)| then it becomes covariant to
rotations:

U [j  (cid:96)] Rγρ(u) = RγU [j  (cid:96)]ρ(u).

The left of Figure 1 shows the real part of 2D solid harmonic wavelets at different scales and angular
frequencies.
In 3D  solid harmonics wavelet are deﬁned by

ψ(cid:96) m(r  ϑ  ϕ) =

e− 1

2 r2

r(cid:96) Y m

(cid:96) (ϑ  ϕ).

1(cid:112)(2π)3

its dilation by 2j.

We write ψ(cid:96) m j
Let us write ω with 3D polar coordinates: ω =
λ(cos α cos β  cos α sin β  sin α)T . The Fourier transform of the wavelet has the same analytical
expression up to a complex factor: ˆψ(cid:96) m(λ  α  β) = (−i)(cid:96)e− 1
(cid:96) (α  β). The 3D covariance
to rotations is more involved. The asymmetry of the azimuthal and elevation components of the
spherical harmonics requires them to be treated differently. In order to obtain a rotation covariance
property  it is necessary to sum the energy over all indices m for a ﬁxed (cid:96). We thus deﬁne the wavelet
modulus operator of a 3D signal ρ(u) by

2 λ2

λ(cid:96) Y m

(cid:32) (cid:96)(cid:88)

m=−(cid:96)

(cid:33)1/2

U [(cid:96)  j]ρ(u) =

|ρ (cid:63) ψ(cid:96) m j(u)|2

.

Using the properties of spherical harmonics  one can prove that this summation over m deﬁnes a
wavelet transform modulus which is covariant to 3D rotations. For a general rotation R ∈ SO(3)

U [j  (cid:96)] Rρ = R U [j  (cid:96)]ρ.

3

2.3 Solid harmonic scattering invariants

We showed that the wavelet modulus U [j  (cid:96)]ρ is covariant to translations and rotations in 2D and 3D.
Summing these coefﬁcients over the spatial variable u thus deﬁnes a translation and rotation invariant
representation. This property remains valid under pointwise transformations  e.g. if we raise the
modulus coefﬁcients to any power q. Since U [j  (cid:96)]ρ(u) is obtained by a wavelet scaled by 2j  it is
a smooth function and its integral can be computed by subsampling u at intervals 2j−α where α is
an oversampling factor typically equal to 1  to avoid aliasing. First order solid harmonic scattering
coefﬁcients in 2D and 3D are deﬁned for any (j1  (cid:96)) and any exponent q by:

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)q
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)U [j1  (cid:96)]ρ(2j1−αu)

(cid:88)

u

S[j1  (cid:96)  q]ρ =

Translating or rotating ρ does not modify S[j1  (cid:96)  q]ρ. Let J > 0 denote the number of scales j1 
and L > 0 the number of angular oscillations (cid:96). We choose q ∈ Q = {1/2  1  2  3  4} which yields
|Q|JL invariant coefﬁcients.
The summation eliminates the variability of the U [j1  (cid:96)]ρ(u) along u. To avoid loosing too much
information  a scattering transform retransforms this function along u in order to capture the lost
variabilities. This is done by calculating a convolution with a second family of wavelets at different
scales 2j2 and again computing a modulus in order to obtain coefﬁcients which remain covariant to
translations and rotations. This means that U [j1  (cid:96)]ρ(u) is retransformed by the wavelet tranform
modulus operator U [j2  (cid:96)]. Clearly U [j2  (cid:96)] U [j1  (cid:96)]ρ(u) is still covariant to translations and rotations
of ρ  since U [j1  (cid:96)] and U [j2  (cid:96)] are covariant to translations and rotations.
The variable u is again subsampled at intervals 2j2−α with an oversampling factor α adjusted
to eliminate the aliasing. Second order scattering invariants are computed by summing over the
subsampled spatial variable u:

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)U [j2  (cid:96)] U [j1  (cid:96)]ρ(2j2−αu)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)q

.

(cid:88)

u

S[j1  j2  (cid:96)  q]ρ =

These coefﬁcients are computed only for j2 > j1 because one can verify [12] that the amplitude of
these invariant coefﬁcients is negligible for j2 ≤ j1. The total number of computed second order
invariants is thus |Q|LJ(J − 1)/2.
In the following  we shall write Sρ = {S[p]ρ}p the scattering representation of ρ  deﬁned by
the indices p = (j1  (cid:96)  q) and p = (j1  j2  (cid:96)  q). These coefﬁcients are computed with iterated
convolutions with wavelets  modulus non-linearities  and averaging. It is proved in [13] that such
wavelet convolutions and non-linearities can be implemented with a deep convolutional network 
whose ﬁlters depend upon the wavelets and whose depth J is the maximum scale index of all wavelets
j1 < j2 ≤ J.
Besides translation and rotation invariance  one can prove that a scattering transform is Lipschitz
continuous to deformations [12]. This means that if ρ(u) is deformed by a small (in maximum
gradient norm) diffeomorphism applied to u  then the scattering vector stays within an error radius
proportional to the size of the diffeomorphism. This property is particularly important to linearly
regress functions which are also stable to deformations.

3 Solid harmonic scattering for quantum energy regression

We study the application of solid harmonic scattering invariants to the regression of quantum molecular
energies. The next section introduces the translation and rotation invariance properties of these
energies.

3.1 Molecular regression invariances

A molecule containing K atoms is entirely deﬁned by its nuclear charges zk and its nuclear position
vectors rk indexed by k. Denoting by x the state vector of a molecule  we have

x = {(rk  zk) ∈ R3 × R : k = 1  . . .   K}.

The ground-state energy of a molecule has the following invariance properties outlined in [1]:

4

Invariance to permutations Energies do not depend on the indexation order k of each nuclei;
Isometry invariance Energies are invariance to rigid translations  rotations  and reﬂections of the

molecule and hence of the rk;

Deformation stability The energy is Lipschitz continuous with respect to scaling of distances

between atoms.

Multiscale interactions The energy has a multiscale structure  with highly energetic bonds between
neighboring atoms  and weaker interactions at larger distances  such as Van-der-Waals
interactions.

To regress quantum energies  a machine learning representation must satisfy the same invariance and
stability properties while providing a set of descriptors which is rich enough to accurately estimate
the atomization energy of a diverse collection of molecules.
A rotation invariant scattering transform has been proposed to regress quantum energies of planar
molecules [9]. However this approach involves too much computations in 3D because it requires to
use a large number of oriented wavelets to cover the 3D spheres. The following sections explains
how to regress the energies of 3D molecules from a spherical harmonic scattering.

3.2 Scattering transform of an electronic density

Density Functional Theory computes molecular energies by introducing an electronic density ρ(u)
which speciﬁes the probability density of presence of an electron at a point u. Similarly  we associate
to the state vector x of the molecule to a naive electronic density ρ which is a sum of Gaussians
densities centered on each nuclei. This density incorporates no information on chemical bounds that
may arise in the molecule. For K atoms placed at {rk}K
k=1  the resulting
density is

k=1 having charges {zk}K

ρx(r) =

c(zk)g(r − rk) 

K(cid:88)

k=1

(cid:88)

where g is a Gaussian  roughly representing an electron density localized around the nucleus  and
c(zk) is a vector-valued “electronic channel”. It encodes different aspects of the atomic structure.
We shall use three channels: the total nuclear charge zk of the atom  the valence electronic charge
vk which speciﬁes the number of electrons which can be involved in chemical bounds  and the core
electronic charge zk − vk. It results that c(zk) = (zk  vk  zk − vk)T . The molecule embedding
veriﬁes

(cid:90)

ρx(u)du =

(zk  vk  zk − vk)T .

k

This integral gives the total number of nucleus charges and valence and core electrons. This naive
density is invariant to permutations of atom indices k.
The density ρx is invariant to permutations of atom indices but it is not invariant to isometries and it
can not separate multiscale interactions. These missing invariances and the separation of scales into
different channels are obtained by computing its scattering representation Sρx with solid harmonic
wavelets.
In Figure 1  there is an example of a 2D solid harmonic wavelet modulus U [j  (cid:96)]ρx for one molecule
at different scales and angular frequencies.

3.3 Multilinear regression

Molecular energies are regressed with multilinear combinations of scattering coefﬁcients Sρx[p]. A
multilinear regression of order r is deﬁned by:

(cid:88)

r(cid:89)

˜Er(ρx) = b +

(νi

((cid:104)Sρx  w(j)

i

(cid:105) + c(j)

i )).

For r = 1 this is a standard linear regression. For r = 2 this form introduces a non-linearity similar
to those found in factored gated autoencoders [14]. Trilinear regressions for r = 3 are also used.

0 to 4 vertically where as the scale 2j increases from left to right. Cartesian slices of 3D spherical
harmonic wavelets yield similar patterns. Right: Solid harmonic wavelet moduli S[j  (cid:96)  1](ρx)(u) =

molecular orbitals obtained in e.g. density functional theory.

Figure 2: Mean absolute error (MAE) on the validation set as a function of the number of training
points used. We observe a fast drop to low estimation errors with as few as 2000 training examples.
While it is still always better to sample more of chemical space  it shows that the representation
carries useful information easily amenable to further analysis  while keeping sufﬁcient complexity to
beneﬁt from when more datapoints are available.

Here we extend the interactions to an arbitrary number of multiplicative factors. We optimize the
parameters of the multilinear model by minimizing a quadratic loss function

L(y  ρx) = (y − ˜Er(ρx))2

using the Adam algorithm for stochastic gradient descent [11]. The model described above is
non-linear in the parameter space and therefore it is reasonable to assume that stochastic gradient
descent will converge to a local optimum. We ﬁnd that we can mitigate the effects of local optimum
convergence by averaging the predictions of multiple models trained with different initializations2.

4 Numerical Experiments on Chemical Databases

Quantum energy regressions are computed on two standard datasets: QM7 (GDB7-12) [18] has
7165 molecules of up to 23 atoms among H  C  O  N and S  and QM9 (GDB9-14) [17] has 133885

molecules of up to 29 atoms among H  C  O  N and F. We ﬁrst review results of existing maching
learning algorithms before giving results obtained with the solid harmonic scattering transform.

4.1 State of the art algorithms

Tables 1 and 2 gives the mean absolute error for each algorithm described below. The ﬁrst machine
learning approaches for quantum energy regressions were based on kernel ridge regression algorithms 
optimized with different types of kernels. Kernels were ﬁrst computed with Coulomb matrices  which
encode pairwise nucleus-nucleus repulsion forces for each molecule [18  15  8  16]. Coulomb matrices
are not invariant to permutations of indices of atoms in the molecules  which leads to regression
instabilities. Improvements have been obtained with bag-of-bonds descriptors [7]  which groups
matrix entries according to bond type  or with ﬁxed-length smooth bond-distance histograms [2].
The BAML method (Bonds  Angles  etc  and machine learning) [10] reﬁnes the kernel by collecting
atomic information  bond information  bond angle information and bond torsion information. The
HDAD (Histograms of Distances  Angles  and Dihedral angles) kernels [5] improve results with
computing histograms of these quantities. Smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAP) kernels [3]
can also obtain precise regression results with local descriptors computed with spherical harmonics.
They are invariant to translations and rotations. However  these kernels only involve local interactions 
and regression results thus degrade in presence of large-scale interactions.
Deep neural networks have also been optimized to estimate quantum molecular energies. They hold
the state of the art on large databases as shown in Tables 1 and 2. Deep tensor networks [19] combine
pairwise distance matrix representations in a deep learning architecture. MPNN (Message Passing
Neural Networks) learns a neural network representation on the molecules represented as bond graphs.
It obtains the best results on the larger QM9 data base.

4.2 Solid harmonic scattering results

We performed rigid afﬁne coordinate transforms to align each molecule with its principle axis  making
it possible to ﬁt every molecule in a box of one long sidelength and two shorter ones. The Gaussian
width of the electronic embedding is adjusted so that Gaussians located around the two atoms with
minimal distance do not overlap too much. In all computations  the sampling grid is adjusted to keep
aliasing errors negligible. Scattering vectors are standardized to have a 0 mean and unit variance
before computing the multilayer regression.

QM7 Scattering vectors are computed with L = 5. We estimated quantum energies with a linear
ridge regression from scattering coefﬁcients. The dataset comes with a split into 5 folds  where the
energy properties are approximately stratiﬁed. The average of the mean absolute error (MAE) over 5
folds is 2.4 kcal/mol. It shows that scattering coefﬁcients are sufﬁciently discriminative to obtain
competitive results with a linear regression.
Bilinear regressions involve more parameters and provides near state of the art performance. We
average 5 differently initialized models over the 5 folds to obtain a mean absolute error of 1.2.
Figure 2 evaluates the performance of the bilinear regression on invariant scattering descriptors. From
as few as 2000 training samples onward  the test set error drops below 3kcal/mol indicating that the
invariant representation gives immediate access to relevant molecular properties. The fact that we
observe improvement with larger data samples means that the representation also exhibits sufﬁcient
ﬂexibility to accommodate relevant information from larger sweeps over chemical space.

QM9 Scattering vectors are computed with L = 2. Quantum energies were estimated from
scattering vectors with linear  bilinear and trilinear regressions. For cross-validation  the dataset is
split into 5 folds  where the energy properties are approximately stratiﬁed. The average of the mean
absolute error (MAE) over 5 folds with a trilinear regression across the 5 folds is 0.55.

4.3 Discussion

The solid harmonic scattering transform followed by a multilinear regression is a domain agnostic
regression scheme which only relies on prior knowledge of translation and rotation invariance as
well as deformation stability. However  it leads to close to state of the art results on each data base.

T-Scat: Trilinear regression on scattering invariants

The size of a scattering descriptor set grows logarithmically with the maximum number of atoms in
the molecule (with increasing molecule size one continues to add scales to the wavelet transform 
which adds logarithmically many coefﬁcients) as opposed to most other methods such as [3] whose
descriptor size grows linearly in the number of atoms in the molecule. Indeed  these techniques are
based on measurements of local individual interactions within neighborhoods of atoms.
The representation splits the information across scales and provides scale interaction coefﬁcients
which can be related to physical phenomena as opposed to millions of deep neural net weights
which are difﬁcult to interpret. Introducing multilinear regression between solid harmonic wavelet
invariants further improves the performance on the energy regression task  achieving near state of the
art performance. This may also be related to multilinear expansions of physical potentials.
It is important to issue a word of caution on the chemical interpretation of these algorithmic regres-
sions. Indeed  all data bases are computed with DFT numerical codes  which only approximate
the energy. For the QM9 database  validation errors are on average 5 kcal/mol [17] on calculated
energies compared to true chemical energies of ground state molecules. Reﬁned results of fractions
of kcal/mol thus no longer add true chemical information but rather reﬂect the ability to estimate the
values produced by DFT numerical codes.

5 Conclusion

We introduced a 2D and 3D solid harmonic wavelet scattering transform which is invariant to
translations and rotations and stable to deformations. It is computed with two successive convolutions
with solid harmonic wavelets and complex modulus. Together with multilinear regressions  this
representation provides near state of the art results for estimation of quantum molecular energies.
The same representation is used for small and large data bases. The mathematical simplicity of
these descriptors opens the possibility to relate these regression to multiscale properties of quantum
chemical interactions.
