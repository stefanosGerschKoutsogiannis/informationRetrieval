Abstract

Many studies have explored the impact of response variability on the quality of
sensory codes. The source of this variability is almost always assumed to be in-
trinsic to the brain. However  when inferring a particular stimulus property  vari-
ability associated with other stimulus attributes also effectively act as noise. Here
we study the impact of such stimulus-induced response variability for the case of
binocular disparity inference. We characterize the response distribution for the
binocular energy model in response to random dot stereograms and ﬁnd it to be
very different from the Poisson-like noise usually assumed. We then compute the
Fisher information with respect to binocular disparity  present in the monocular
inputs to the standard model of early binocular processing  and thereby obtain an
upper bound on how much information a model could theoretically extract from
them. Then we analyze the information loss incurred by the different ways of
combining those inputs to produce a scalar single-neuron response. We ﬁnd that
in the case of depth inference  monocular stimulus variability places a greater
limit on the extractable information than intrinsic neuronal noise for typical spike
counts. Furthermore  the largest loss of information is incurred by the standard
model for position disparity neurons (tuned-excitatory)  that are the most ubiqui-
tous in monkey primary visual cortex  while more information from the inputs is
preserved in phase-disparity neurons (tuned-near or tuned-far) primarily found in
higher cortical regions.

Introduction

Understanding how the brain performs statistical inference is one of the main problems of theoreti-
cal neuroscience. In this paper  we propose to apply the tools developed to evaluate the information
content of neuronal codes corrupted by noise to address the question of how well they support sta-
tistical inference. At the core of our approach lies the interpretation of neuronal response variability
due to nuisance stimulus variability as noise.
Many theoretical and experimental studies have probed the impact of intrinsic response variability on
the quality of sensory codes ([1  12] and references therein). However  most neurons are responsive
to more than one stimulus attribute. So when trying to infer a particular stimulus property  the
brain needs to be able to ignore the effect of confounding attributes that also inﬂuence the neuron’s
response. We propose to evaluate the usefulness of a population code for inference over a particular
parameter by treating the neuronal response variability due to nuisance stimulus attributes as noise
equivalent to intrinsic noise (e.g. Poisson spiking).
We explore the implications of this new approach for the model system of stereo vision where the
inference task is to extract depth from binocular images. We compute the Fisher information present

in the monocular inputs to the standard model of early binocular processing and thereby obtain an
upper bound on how precisely a model could theoretically extract depth. We compare this with the
amount of information that remains after early visual processing. We distinguish the two principal
model ﬂavors that have been proposed to explain the physiological ﬁndings. We ﬁnd that one of the
two models appears superior to the other one for inferring depth.
We start by giving a brief introduction to the two principal ﬂavors of the binocular energy model. We
then retrace the processing steps and compute the Fisher information with respect to depth inference
that is present: ﬁrst in the monocular inputs  then after binocular combination  and ﬁnally for the
resulting tuning curves.

2 Binocular disparity as a model system

Stereo vision has the advantage of a clear separation between the relevant stimulus dimension –
binocular disparity – and the confounding or nuisance stimulus attributes – monocular image struc-
ture ([9]). The challenge in inferring disparity in image pairs consists in distinguishing true from
false matches  regardless of the monocular structures in the two images. The stimulus that tests this
system in the most general way are random dot stereograms (RDS) that consist of nearly identical
dot patterns in either eye (see Figure 1). The fact that parts of the images are displaced horizontally
with respect to each other has been shown to be sufﬁcient to give rise to a sensation of depth in
humans and monkeys ([5  4]). Since RDS do not contain any monocular depth cues (e.g. size or
perspective) the brain needs to correctly match the monocular image features across eyes to compute
disparity.
The standard model for binocular processing in primary visual cortex (V1) is the binocular energy
model ([5  10]). It explains the response of disparity-selective V1 neurons by linearly combining the
output of monocular simple cells and passing the sum through a squaring nonlinearity (illustrated in
Figure 1).

the phases in left and right grating – as observed for complex cells in V1. The disparity tuning curve
resulting from the combination in equation (1) is even-symmetric (illustrated in Figure 1 in blue)
and is one of two primary types of tuning curves found in cortex ([5]). In order to model the other 
odd-symmetric type of tuning curves (Figure 1 in red)  the ﬁlter outputs are combined such that the
output of an even-symmetric ﬁlter is always combined with that of an odd-symmetric one in the
other eye:

output (the ﬁrst four terms in equations 1 and 2) and only vary in their binocular interaction terms
(in brackets). The only way in which the ﬁrst model can implement preferred disparities other than
zero is by a positional displacement of the RFs in the two eyes with respect to each other (the
disparity tuning curve achieves its maximum when the disparity in the image matches the disparity
between the RFs). The second model  on the other hand achieves non-zero preferred disparities by
employing a phase shift between the left and right RF (90 deg in our case). It is therefore considered
to be phase-disparity model  while the ﬁrst one is called a position disparity one.2

3 Results

How much information the response of a neuron carries about a particular stimulus attribute depends
both on the sensitivity of the response to changes in that attribute and to the variability (or uncer-
tainty) in the response across all stimuli while keeping that attribute ﬁxed. Fisher information is the
standard way to quantify this intuition in the context of intrinsic noise ([6]  but also see [2]) and we
will use it to evaluate the binocular energy model mechanisms with regard to their ability to extract
the disparity information contained in the monocular inputs arriving at the eyes.

3.1 Response variability

Figure 2 shows the mean of the binocular response of the two models.
The variation of the response around the mean due to the variation in
monocular image structure in the RDS is shown in Figure 3 (top row)
for four exemplary disparities: −1  0  1 and uncorrelated (±∞)  indi-
cated in Figure 2. Unlike in the commonly assumed case of intrinsic
noise  pbinoc(r|d) – the stimulus-conditioned response distribution –
is far from Poisson or Gaussian. Interestingly  its mode is always at
zero – the average response to uncorrelated stimuli – and the fact that
the mean depends on the stimulus disparity is primarily due to the
disparity-dependence of the skew of the response distribution (Figure
3).3 The skew in turn depends on the disparity through the disparity-
dependent correlation between the RF outputs as illustrated in Figure
3 (bottom row). Of particular interest are the response distributions
at the zero disparity 4  the disparities at which rodd takes its minimum and maximum  respectively 
and the uncorrelated case (inﬁnite disparity). In the case of inﬁnite disparity  the images in the two
eyes are completely independent of each other and hence the outputs of the left and right RFs are
independent Gaussians. Therefore  νLνR ∼ pbinoc(r|d = ∞) is symmetric around 0. In the case of
zero disparity (identical images in left and right eye)  the correlation is 1 between the outputs of left
and right RFs (both even  or both odd). It follows that νLνR ∼ χ2
1 and hence has a mean of 1. What
is also apparent is that the binocular energy model with phase disparity (where each even-symmetric
RF is paired with an odd-symmetric one) never achieves perfect correlation between the left and
right eye and only covers smaller values.

model and odd-symmetric tuning. Unfortunately  the term disparity is used for both disparities between the
RFs  and for disparities between left and right images (in the stimulus). If not indicated otherwise  we will
always refer to stimulus disparity for the rest of the paper.
3The RF outputs are Normally distributed in the limit of inﬁnitely many dots (RFs act as linear ﬁlters +
central limit theorem). Therefore the disparity-conditioned responses p(r|d) correspond to the off-diagonal
terms in a Wishart distribution  marginalized over all the other matrix elements.

4WLOG we assume the displacement between the RF centers in the left and right eye to be zero.
5The model RFs have been normalized by their variance  such that var[ν] = 1 and ν ∼ N (0  1).

In Figure 4B (black) we plot the Fisher information as a function of disparity. We ﬁnd that the Fisher
information available in the inputs diverges at zero disparity (at the difference between the centers
of the left and right RFs in general). This means that the ability to discriminate zero disparity from

7The assumption that the binocular interaction can be modeled by a Gabor is not important for the principal
results of this paper. In fact  the formulas for the Fisher information in the monocular inputs and in the disparity
tuning curves derived below hold for other (reasonable) choices for a(d) and c(d) as well.

The dependence of Fisher information on d is shown in Figure 4B (blue). The total information
(as measured by integrating Fisher information over all disparities) communicated by the position-
disparity model is greatly reduced compared to the total Fisher information present in the inputs.
a(d) is an even-symmetric Gabor (illustrated in Figure 2) and hence the Fisher information is great-
est on either side of the maximum where the slopes of a(d) are steepest  and zero at the center
where a(d) has its peak. We note here that the Fisher information for the ﬁnal tuning curve for
the position-disparity model is the same as in equation (4) and therefore we will postpone a more
detailed discussion of it until section 3.2.3.

combining the monocular outputs not symmetric? Insight into this question can be gained by looking
at the binocular interaction terms in the quadratic expansion of the feature space for the two models.9

3.2.3 Disparity tuning curves

In order to collapse the 2-dimensional binocular inputs into a scalar output that can be coded in the
spike rate of a neuron  the energy model postulates a squaring output nonlinearity after each linear
combination and summing the results. Since the (νL + νR)2 are not Normally distributed and their
means depend on the stimulus disparity  we cannot employ the above approach to calculate Fisher
information but instead use the more general

Remarkably  this is exactly the same amount of information that is available after summing left and
right RFs (see equation 4)  so none is lost after squaring and combining the quadrature pair. We show
Ieven(d) in Figure 4C (blue). It is also interesting to note that the general form for Ieven(d) differs
from the Fisher information based on the Poisson noise model (and ignoring stimulus variability as
considered here) only by the exponent of 2 in the denominator. Since 1 + a(d) ≥ 0 this means
that the qualitative dependence of I on d is the same  the main difference being that the Fisher
information favors small over large spike rates even more. Conversely  it follows that when Fisher
information only takes the neuronal noise into consideration  it greatly overestimates the information
that the neuron carries with respect to the to-be-inferred stimulus parameter for realistic spike counts
(of greater than two). Furthermore  unlike in the Poisson case  a scaling up of the tuning function
1 + a(d) does not translate into greater Fisher information. Fisher information with respect to
stimulus variability as considered here is invariant to the absolute height of the tuning curve.12

15 The dependence of I simple
on disparity is shown in Figure 4C (red dashed). Most of the Fisher
information is located in the primary slope (compare Figure 4A) followed by secondary slope to
its left. The reason for this is the strong boost Fisher information gets when responses are lowest.
We also see that the total Fisher information carried by a phase-disparity simple cell is signiﬁcantly
higher than that carried by a position-disparity simple cell (compare dashed red and blue lines)
raising the question of what other advantages or trade-offs there are that make it beneﬁcial for the
primate brain to employ so many position-disparity ones. Intrinsic neuronal variability may provide
part of the answer since the difference in Fisher information between both models decreases as
intrinsic variability increases. Figure 4D shows the Fisher information after Gaussian noise has been
added to the monocular inputs. However  even in this high intrinsic noise regime (noise variance of
the same order as tuning curve amplitude) the model with phase disparity carries signiﬁcantly more
total Fisher information.

12What is outside of the scope of this paper but obvious from equation (7) is that Fisher information is
maximized when the denominator  or the tuning function is minimal. Within the context of the energy model 
this occurs for neither the position-disparity model  nor the classic phase-disparity one  but for a model where
the left and right RFs that are linearly combined  are inverted with respect to each other (i.e. phase-shifted by
π). In that case a(d) is a Gabor function with phase π and becomes zero at zero disparity such that the Fisher
information diverges. Such neurons  called tuned-inhibitory (TI  [11]) make up a small minority of neurons in
monkey V1.

4 Discussion

The central idea of our paper is to evaluate the quality of a sensory code with respect to an inference
task by taking stimulus variability into account  in particular that induced by irrelevant stimulus
attributes. By framing stimulus-induced nuisance variability as noise  we were able to employ the
existing framework of Fisher information for evaluating the standard model of early binocular pro-
cessing with respect to inferring disparity from random dot stereograms.
We started by investigating the disparity-conditioned variability of the binocular response in the ab-
sence of intrinsic neuronal noise. We found that the response distributions are far from Poisson or
Gaussian and – independent of stimulus disparity – are always peaked at zero (the mean response
to uncorrelated images). The information contained in the correlations between left and right RF
outputs are translated into a modulation of the neuron’s mean ﬁring rate primarily by altering the
skew of the response distribution. This is quite different from the case of intrinsic noise and has
implications for comparing different codes. It is noteworthy that these response distributions are
entirely imposed by the sensory system – the combination of the structure of the external world with
the internal processing model. Unlike the case of intrinsic noise which is usually added ad-hoc after
the neuronal computation has been performed  in our case the computational model impacts the use-
fulness of the code beyond the traditionally reported tuning functions. This property extends to the
case of population codes  the next step for future work. Of great importance for the performance of
population codes are interneuronal correlations. Again  the noise correlations due to nuisance stim-
ulus parameters are a direct consequence of the processing model and the structure of the external
input.
Next we compared the Fisher information available for our inference task at various stages of binoc-
ular processing. We computed the Fisher information available in the monocular inputs to binocular
neurons in V1  after binocular combination and after the squaring nonlinearity required to translate
binocular correlations into mean ﬁring rate modulation. We ﬁnd that despite the great stimulus vari-
ability  the total Fisher information available in the inputs diverges and is only bounded by intrinsic
neuronal variability. The same is still true after binocular combination for one ﬂavor of the model
considered here – that employing phase disparity (or pairing unlike RFs in either eye)  not the other
one (position disparity)  which has lost most information after the initial combination. At this point 
our new approach allows us to ask a normative question: In what way should the monocular inputs
be combined so as to lose a minimal amount of information about the relevant stimulus dimension?
Is the combination proposed by the standard model to obtain even-symmetric tuning curves the only
one to do so or are they others that produce a different tuning curve  with a different response dis-
tribution that is more suited to inferring depth? Conversely  we can compare our results for the
model stages leading from simple to complex cells and compare them with the corresponding Fisher
information computed from empirically observed distributions  to test our model assumptions.
Recently  Fisher information has been criticized as a tool for comparing population codes ([3  2]).
We note that our approach can be readily adapted to other measures like mutual information or
their framework of neurometric function analysis to compare the performance of different codes in
a disparity discrimination task.
Another potentially promising avenue of future research would to investigate the effect of thresh-
olding on inference performance. One reason that odd-symmetric tuning curves had higher Fisher
information in the case we investigated was that odd-symmetric cells produce near-zero responses
more often in the context of the energy model. However  it is known from empirical observations
that ﬁtting even-symmetric disparity tuning curves requires an additional thresholding output non-
linearity. It is unclear at this point to what extend such a change to the response distribution helps or
hinders inference.
And ﬁnally  we suggest that considering the different shapes of response distributions induced by
the speciﬁcs of the sensory modality might have an impact on the discussion about probabilistic
population codes ([7  8] and references therein). Cue-integration  for instance  has usually been
studied under the assumption of Poisson-like response distributions  assumptions that do not appear
to hold in the case of combining disparity cues from different parts of the visual ﬁeld.
