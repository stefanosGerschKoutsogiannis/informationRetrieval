Abstract

Many species show avoidance reactions in response to looming object approaches.
In locusts  the corresponding escape behavior correlates with the activity of the
lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) neuron. During an object approach  its
ﬁring rate was reported to gradually increase until a peak is reached  and then
it declines quickly. The (cid:17)-function predicts that the LGMD activity is a product
between an exponential function of angular size exp((cid:0)(cid:2)) and angular velocity _(cid:2) 
and that peak activity is reached before time-to-contact (ttc). The (cid:17)-function has
become the prevailing LGMD model because it reproduces many experimental
observations  and even experimental evidence for the multiplicative operation was
reported. Several inconsistencies remain unresolved  though. Here we address
these issues with a new model ( -model)  which explicitly connects (cid:2) and _(cid:2) to
biophysical quantities. The  -model avoids biophysical problems associated with
implementing exp((cid:1))  implements the multiplicative operation of (cid:17) via divisive
inhibition  and explains why activity peaks could occur after ttc. It consistently
predicts response features of the LGMD  and provides excellent ﬁts to published
experimental data  with goodness of ﬁt measures comparable to corresponding ﬁts
with the (cid:17)-function.

1 Introduction: (cid:28) and (cid:17)

Collision sensitive neurons were reported in species such different as monkeys [5  4]  pigeons
[36  34]  frogs [16  20]  and insects [33  26  27  10  38]. This indicates a high ecological relevance 
and raises the question about how neurons compute a signal that eventually triggers corresponding
movement patterns (e.g. escape behavior or interceptive actions). Here  we will focus on visual
stimulation. Consider  for simplicity  a circular object (diameter 2l)  which approaches the eye at
a collision course with constant velocity v. If we do not have any a priori knowledge about the
object in question (e.g. its typical size or speed)  then we will be able to access only two information
sources. These information sources can be measured at the retina and are called optical variables
(OVs). The ﬁrst is the visual angle (cid:2)  which can be derived from the number of stimulated photore-
ceptors (spatial contrast). The second is its rate of change d(cid:2)(t)=dt (cid:17) _(cid:2)(t). Angular velocity _(cid:2) is
related to temporal contrast.
How should we combine (cid:2) and _(cid:2) in order to track an imminent collision? The perhaps simplest
combination is (cid:28) (t) (cid:17) (cid:2)(t)= _(cid:2)(t) [13  18]. If the object hit us at time tc  then (cid:28) (t) (cid:25) tc (cid:0) t will

give us a running estimation of the time that is left until contact1. Moreover  we do not need to know
anything about the approaching object: The ttc estimation computed by (cid:28) is practically independent
of object size and velocity. Neurons with (cid:28)-like responses were indeed identiﬁed in the nucleus re-
tundus of the pigeon brain [34]. In humans  only fast interceptive actions seem to rely exclusively on
(cid:28) [37  35]. Accurate ttc estimation  however  seems to involve further mechanisms (rate of disparity
change [31]).
Another function of OVs with biological relevance is (cid:17) (cid:17) _(cid:2) exp((cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:2))  with (cid:11) = const: [10].
While (cid:17)-type neurons were found again in pigeons [34] and bullfrogs [20]  most data were gath-
ered from the LGMD2 in locusts (e.g. [10  9  7  23]). The (cid:17)-function is a phenomenological model
for the LGMD  and implies three principal hypothesis: (i) An implementation of an exponential
function exp((cid:1)). Exponentation is thought to take place in the LGMD axon  via active membrane
conductances [8]. Experimental data  though  seem to favor a third-power law rather than exp((cid:1)).
(ii) The LGMD carries out biophysical computations for implementing the multiplicative operation.
It has been suggested that multiplication is done within the LGMD itself  by subtracting the loga-
rithmically encoded variables log _(cid:2) (cid:0) (cid:11)(cid:2) [10  8]. (iii) The peak of the (cid:17)-function occurs before
ttc  at visual angle (cid:2)(^t) = 2 arctan(1=(cid:11)) [9]. It follows ttc for certain stimulus conﬁgurations (e.g.
l=jvj / 5ms). In principle  ^t > tc can be accounted for by (cid:17)(t + (cid:14)) with a ﬁxed delay (cid:14) < 0 (e.g.
(cid:0)27ms). But other researchers observed that LGMD activity continuous to rise after ttc even for
l=jvj ’ 5ms [28]. These discrepancies remain unexplained so far [29]  but stimulation dynamics
perhaps plays a role.
We we will address these three issues by comparing the novel function “ ” with the (cid:17)-function.

2 LGMD computations with the  -function: No multiplication  no

exponentiation

A circular object which starts its approach at distance x0 and with speed v projects a visual angle
(cid:2)(t) = 2 arctan[l=(x0 (cid:0) vt)] on the retina [34  9]. The kinematics is hence entirely speciﬁed by the
half-size-to-velocity ratio l=jvj  and x0. Furthermore  _(cid:2)(t) = 2lv=((x0 (cid:0) vt)2 + l2).
In order to deﬁne    we consider at ﬁrst the LGMD neuron as an RC-circuit with membrane poten-
tial3 V [17]

= (cid:12) (Vrest (cid:0) V ) + gexc (Vexc (cid:0) V ) + ginh (Vinh (cid:0) V )

(1)
Cm = membrane capacity4; (cid:12) (cid:17) 1=Rm denotes leakage conductance across the cell membrane
(Rm: membrane resistance); gexc and ginh are excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Each conductance
gi (i = exc; inh) can drive the membrane potential to its associated reversal potential Vi (usually
Vinh (cid:20) Vexc). Shunting inhibition means Vinh = Vrest. Shunting inhibition lurks “silently” because
it gets effective only if the neuron is driven away from its resting potential. With synaptic input  the
neuron decays into its equilibrium state

V1 (cid:17) Vrest(cid:12) + Vexcgexc + Vinhginh

(2)
according to V (t) = V1(1 (cid:0) exp((cid:0)t=(cid:28)m)). Without external input  V (t (cid:29) 1) ! Vrest. The
time scale is set by (cid:28)m. Without synaptic input (cid:28)m (cid:17) Cm=(cid:12). Slowly varying inputs gexc; ginh > 0
modify the time scale to approximately (cid:28)m=(1 + (gexc + ginh)=(cid:12)). For highly dynamic inputs  such
as in late phase of the object approach  the time scale gets dynamical as well. The  -model assigns
synaptic inputs5

(cid:12) + gexc + ginh

gexc(t) = _#(t);
ginh(t) = [(cid:13)#(t)]e ;

_#(t (cid:0) (cid:1)tstim) + (1 (cid:0) (cid:16)1) _(cid:2)(t)
_#(t) = (cid:16)1
#(t) = (cid:16)0#(t (cid:0) (cid:1)tstim) + (1 (cid:0) (cid:16)0)(cid:2)(t)

(3a)
(3b)

1This linear approximation gets worse with increasing (cid:2)  but turns out to work well until short before ttc ((cid:28)

adopts a minimum at tc (cid:0) 0:428978 (cid:1) l=jvj).

2LGMD activity is usually monitored via its postsynaptic neuron  the Descending Contralateral Movement
Detector (DCMD) neuron. This represents no problem as LGMD spikes follow DCMD spikes 1:1 under visual
stimulation [22] from 300Hz [21] to at least 400Hz [24].

3Here we assume that the membrane potential serves as a predictor for the LGMD’s mean ﬁring rate.
4Set to unity for all simulations.
5LGMD receives also inhibition from a laterally acting network [21]. The (cid:17)-function considers only direct

feedforward inhibition [22  6]  and so do we.

(a) discretized optical variables

(b)   versus (cid:17)

Figure 1: (a) The continuous visual angle of an approaching object is shown along with its dis-
cretized version. Discretization transforms angular velocity from a continuous variable into a series
of “spikes” (rescaled). (b) The   function with the inputs shown in a  with nrelax = 25 relaxation
time steps. Its peak occurs tmax = 56ms before ttc (tc = 300ms). An (cid:17) function ((cid:11) = 3:29) that
was ﬁtted to   shows good agreement. For continuous optical variables  the peak would occur 4ms
earlier  and (cid:17) would have (cid:11) = 4:44 with R2 = 1. For nrelax = 10    is farther away from its
equilibrium at V1  and its peak moves 19ms closer to ttc.

(a) different nrelax

(b) different (cid:1)tstim

Figure 2: The ﬁgures plot the relative time tmax (cid:17) tc (cid:0) ^t of the response peak of    V (^t)  as a
function of half-size-to-velocity ratio (points). Line ﬁts with slope (cid:11) and intercept (cid:14) were added
(lines). The predicted linear relationship in all cases is consistent with experimental evidence [9].
(a) The stimulus time scale is held constant at (cid:1)tstim = 1ms  and several LGMD time scales
are deﬁned by nrelax (= number of intercalated relaxation steps for each integration time step).
Bigger values of nrelax move V (t) closer to its equilibrium V1(t)  implying higher slopes (cid:11) in
turn. (b) LGMD time scale is ﬁxed at nrelax = 25  and (cid:1)tstim is manipulated. Because of the
discretization of optical variables (OVs) in our simulation  increasing (cid:1)tstim translates to an overall
smaller number of jumps in OVs  but each with higher amplitude.

Thus  we say  (t) (cid:17) V (t) if and only if gexc and ginh are deﬁned with the last equation. The time
scale of stimulation is deﬁned by (cid:1)tstim (by default 1ms). The variables # and _# are lowpass ﬁltered
angular size and rate of expansion  respectively. The amount of ﬁltering is deﬁned by memory
constants (cid:16)0 and (cid:16)1 (no ﬁltering if zero). The idea is to continue with generating synaptic input
after ttc  where (cid:2)(t > tc) = const and thus _(cid:2)(t > tc) = 0. Inhibition is ﬁrst weighted by (cid:13) 
and then potentiated by the exponent e. Hodgkin-Huxley potentiates gating variables n; m 2 [0; 1]
instead (potassium / n4  sodium / m3  [12]) and multiplies them with conductances. Gabbiani
and co-workers found that the function which transforms membrane potential to ﬁring rate is better
described by a power function with e = 3 than by exp((cid:1)) (Figure 4d in [8]).

Discretization. In a typical experiment  a monitor is placed a short distance away from the insect’s
eye  and an approaching object is displayed. Computer screens have a ﬁxed spatial resolution  and
as a consequence size increments of the displayed object proceed in discrete jumps. The locust
retina is furthermore composed of a discrete array of ommatidia units. We therefore can expect
a corresponding step-wise increment of (cid:2) with time  although optical and neuronal ﬁltering may
smooth (cid:2) to some extent again  resulting in # (ﬁgure 1). Discretization renders _(cid:2) discontinuous 
what again will be alleviated in _#. For simulating the dynamics of    we discretized angular size
with (cid:13)oor((cid:2))  and _(cid:2)(t) (cid:25) [(cid:2)(t + (cid:1)tstim) (cid:0) (cid:2)(t)]=(cid:1)tstim. Discretized optical variables (OVs)
were re-normalized to match the range of original (i.e. continuous) OVs.
To peak  or not to peak? Rind & Simmons reject the hypothesis that the activity peak signals
impending collision on grounds of two arguments [28]: (i) If (cid:2)(t + (cid:1)tstim)(cid:0) (cid:2)(t) ’ 3o in consec-
utively displayed stimulus frames  the illusion of an object approach would be lost. Such stimulation
would rather be perceived as a sequence of rapidly appearing (but static) objects  causing reduced
responses. (ii) After the last stimulation frame has been displayed (that is (cid:2) = const)  LGMD
responses keep on building up beyond ttc. This behavior clearly depends on l=jvj  also according
to their own data (e.g. Figure 4 in [26]): Response build up after ttc is typically observed for sufﬁ-
ciently small values of l=jvj. Input into   in situations where (cid:2) = const and _(cid:2) = 0  respectively 
is accommodated by # and _#  respectively.
We simulated (i) by setting (cid:1)tstim = 5ms  thus producing larger and more infrequent jumps in
discrete OVs than with (cid:1)tstim = 1ms (default). As a consequence  #(t) grows more slowly (de-
layed build up of inhibition)  and the peak occurs later (tmax (cid:17) tc (cid:0) ^t = 10ms with everything else
identical with ﬁgure 1b). The peak amplitude ^V = V (^t) decreases nearly sixfold with respect to
default. Our model thus predicts the reduced responses observed by Rind & Simmons [28].
Linearity. Time of peak ﬁring rate is linearly related to l=jvj [10  9]. The (cid:17)-function is consistent
with this experimental evidence: ^t = tc (cid:0) (cid:11)l=jvj + (cid:14) (e.g. (cid:11) = 4:7  (cid:14) = (cid:0)27ms). The  -function
reproduces this relationship as well (ﬁgure 2)  where (cid:11) depends critically on the time scale of bio-
physical processes in the LGMD. We studied the impact of this time scale by choosing 10(cid:22)s for the
numerical integration of equation 1 (algorithm: 4th order Runge-Kutta). Apart from improving the
numerical stability of the integration algorithm    is far from its equilibrium V1(t) in every moment
t  given the stimulation time scale (cid:1)tstim = 1ms 6. Now  at each value of (cid:2)(t) and _(cid:2)(t)  respec-
tively  we intercalated nrelax iterations for integrating  . Each iteration takes V (t) asymptotically
closer to V1(t)  and limnrelax(cid:29)1 V (t) = V1(t). If the internal processes in the LGMD cannot keep
up with stimulation (nrelax = 0)  we obtain slopes values that underestimate experimentally found
values (ﬁgure 2a). In contrast  for nrelax ’ 25 we get an excellent agreement with the experimen-
tally determined (cid:11). This means that – under the reported experimental stimulation conditions (e.g.
[9]) – the LGMD would operate relatively close to its steady state7.
Now we ﬁx nrelax at 25 and manipulate (cid:1)tstim instead (ﬁgure 2b). The default value (cid:1)tstim = 1ms
corresponds to (cid:11) = 3:91. Slightly bigger values of (cid:1)tstim (2:5ms and 5ms) underestimate the ex-
perimental (cid:11). In addition  the line ﬁts also return smaller intercept values then. We see tmax < 0 up
to l=jvj (cid:25) 13:5ms – LGMD activity peaks after ttc! Or  in other words  LGMD activity continues
to increase after ttc. In the limit  where stimulus dynamics is extremely fast  and LGMD processes
are kept far from equilibrium at each instant of the approach  (cid:11) gets very small. As a consequence 
tmax gets largely independent of l=jvj: The activity peak would cling to tmax although we varied
l=jvj.

4 Freeze! Experimental data versus steady state of “psi”

In the previous section  experimentally plausible values for (cid:11) were obtained if   is close to equilib-
rium at each instant of time during stimulation. In this section we will thus introduce a steady-state

6Assuming one (cid:1)tstim for each integration time step. This means that by default stimulation and biophys-

ical dynamics will proceed at identical time scales.

7Notice that in this moment we can only make relative statements - we do not have data at hand for deﬁning

absolute time scales

In each display  one parameter of  1 is varied (legend)  while the others are held constant (ﬁgure

peak of the (cid:17)-function was placed at tc  by choosing  at each parameter value  (cid:11) = jvj(cid:1) (tc (cid:0) ^t)=l (for
determining correlation  the mean value of (cid:11) was taken across l=jvj).

(Here we use continuous versions of angular size and rate of expansion). The  1-function
makes life easier when it comes to ﬁtting experimental data. However  it has its limitations  be-
cause we brushed the whole dynamic of   under the carpet. Figure 3 illustrates how the lin-
ear relationship (=“linearity”) between tmax (cid:17) tc (cid:0) ^t and l=jvj is inﬂuenced by changes in pa-
rameter values. Changing any of the values of e  (cid:12)  (cid:13) predominantly causes variation in line
slopes. The smallest slope changes are obtained by varying Vinh (data not shown; we checked
Vinh = 0;(cid:0)0:001;(cid:0)0:01;(cid:0)0:1). For Vinh / (cid:0)0:01  linearity is getting slightly compromised  as
slope increases with l=jvj (e.g. Vinh = (cid:0)1   (cid:11) 2 [4:2; 4:7]).
In order to get a notion about how well the shape of  1(t) matches (cid:17)(t)  we computed time-
averaged difference measures between normalized versions of both functions (details: ﬁgure 3 & 4).
Bigger values of (cid:12) match (cid:17) better at smaller  but worse at bigger values of l=jvj (ﬁgure 4a). Smaller
(cid:12) cause less variation across l=jvj. As to variation of e  overall curve shapes seem to be best aligned
with e = 3 to e = 4 (ﬁgure 4b). Furthermore  better matches between  1(t) and (cid:17)(t) correspond to
bigger values of (cid:13) (ﬁgure 4c). And ﬁnally  Vinh marches again to a different tune (data not shown).
Vinh = (cid:0)0:1 leads to the best agreement ((cid:25) 0:04 across l=jvj) of all Vinh  quite different from the
other considered values. For the rest   1(t) and (cid:17)(t) align the same (all have maximum 0:094)

(b) Fitting coefﬁcient (cid:11) (! (cid:17)-function) inversely correlates with (cid:12) (!  1) when ﬁtting ﬁring rates
of another 5 trials as just described (continuous line = line ﬁt to the data points). Similar correlation
values would be obtained if e is ﬁxed at values e = 2:5; 4; 5   c = (cid:0)0:95;(cid:0)0:96;(cid:0)0:91. If o was
determined by the ﬁtting algorithm  then c = (cid:0)0:70. No clear correlations with (cid:11) were obtained for
(cid:13).

Decelerating approach. Hatsopoulos et al. [10] recorded DCMD activity in response to an ap-
proaching object which projected image edges on the retina moving at constant velocity: _(cid:2) = const:
implies (cid:2)(t) = (cid:2)0 + _(cid:2)t. This “linear approach” is perceived as if the object is getting increasingly
slower. But what appears a relatively unnatural movement pattern serves as a test for the functions
(cid:17) &  1. Figure 5 illustrates that  1 passes the test  and consistently predicts that activity sharply
rises in the initial approach phase  and subsequently declines ((cid:17) passed this test already in the year
1995).

We re-sampled about 30 curves obtained from LGMD recordings from a variety of
publications  and ﬁtted (cid:17) &  1-functions. We cannot show the results here  but in terms of good-
ness of ﬁt measures  both functions are in the same ballbark. Rather  ﬁgure 6a shows a representative
example [30]. When (cid:11) and (cid:12) are plotted against each other for ﬁve trials  we see a strong inverse
correlation (ﬁgure 6b). Although ﬁve data points are by no means a ﬁrm statistical sample  the
strong correlation could indicate that (cid:12) and (cid:11) play similar roles in both functions. Biophysically  (cid:12)
is the leakage conductance  which determines the (passive) membrane time constant (cid:28)m / 1=(cid:12) of
the neuron. Voltage drops within (cid:28)m to exp((cid:0)1) times its initial value. Bigger values of (cid:12) mean
shorter (cid:28)m (i.e.  “faster neurons”). Getting back to (cid:17)  this would suggest (cid:11) / (cid:28)m  such that higher
(absolute) values for (cid:11) would possibly indicate a slower dynamic of the underlying processes.

5 Discussion (“The Good  the Bad  and the Ugly”)

Up to now  mainly two classes of LGMD models existed: The phenomenological (cid:17)-function on the
one hand  and computational models with neuronal layers presynaptic to the LGMD on the other
(e.g. [25  15]; real-world video sequences & robotics: e.g. [3  14  32  2]). Computational models
predict that LGMD response features originate from excitatory and inhibitory interactions in – and
between – presynaptic neuronal layers. Put differently  non-linear operations are generated in the
presynaptic network  and can be a function of many (model) parameters (e.g. synaptic weights  time
constants  etc.). In contrast  the (cid:17)-function assigns concrete nonlinear operations to the LGMD [7].
The (cid:17)-function is accessible to mathematical analysis  whereas computational models have to be
probed with videos or artiﬁcial stimulus sequences. The (cid:17)-function is vague about biophysical pa-
rameters  whereas (good) computational models need to be precise at each (model) parameter value.
The (cid:17)-function establishes a clear link between physical stimulus attributes and LGMD activity: It
postulates what is to be computed from the optical variables (OVs). But in computational models 
such a clear understanding of LGMD inputs cannot always be expected: Presynaptic processing may
strongly transform OVs.
The   function thus represents an intermediate model class: It takes OVs as input  and connects them
with biophysical parameters of the LGMD. For the neurophysiologist  the situation could hardly be
any better. Psi implements the multiplicative operation of the (cid:17)-function by shunting inhibition
(equation 1: Vexc (cid:25) Vrest and Vinh (cid:25) Vrest). The (cid:17)-function ﬁts   very well according to our
dynamical simulations (ﬁgure 1)  and satisfactory by the approximate criterion of ﬁgure 4.
We can conclude that   implements the (cid:17)-function in a biophysically plausible way. However   
does neither explicitly specify (cid:17)’s multiplicative operation  nor its exponential function exp((cid:1)). In-
stead we have an interaction between shunting inhibition and a power law ((cid:1))e  with e (cid:25) 3. So what
about power laws in neurons?
Because of e > 1  we have an expansive nonlinearity. Expansive power-law nonlinearities are well
established in phenomenological models of simple cells of the primate visual cortex [1  11]. Such
models approximate a simple cell’s instantaneous ﬁring rate r from linear ﬁltering of a stimulus (say
Y ) by r / ([Y ]+)e  where [(cid:1)]+ sets all negative values to zero and lets all positive pass. Although
experimental evidence favors linear thresholding operations like r / [Y (cid:0) Ythres]+  neuronal re-
sponses can behave according to power law functions if Y includes stimulus-independent noise [19].
Given this evidence  the power-law function of the inhibitory input into   could possibly be inter-
preted as a phenomenological description of presynaptic processes.
The power law would also be the critical feature by means of which the neurophysiologist could dis-
tinguish between the (cid:17) function and  . A study of Gabbiani et al. aimed to provide direct evidence
for a neuronal implementation of the (cid:17)-function [8]. Consequently  the study would be an evidence
for a biophysical implementation of “direct” multiplication via log _(cid:2) (cid:0) (cid:11)(cid:2). Their experimental
evidence fell somewhat short in the last part  where “exponentation through active membrane con-
ductances” should invert logarithmic encoding. Speciﬁcally  the authors observed that “In 7 out of
10 neurons  a third-order power law best described the data” (sixth-order in one animal). Alea iacta
est.
