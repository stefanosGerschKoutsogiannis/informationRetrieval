Abstract

Measurement of spatial ﬁelds is of interest in environment monitoring. Recently
mobile sensing has been proposed for spatial ﬁeld reconstruction  which requires a
smaller number of sensors when compared to the traditional paradigm of sensing
with static sensors. A challenge in mobile sensing is to overcome the location
uncertainty of its sensors. While GPS or other localization methods can reduce
this uncertainty  we address a more fundamental question: can a location-unaware
mobile sensor  recording samples on a directed non-uniform random walk  learn
the statistical distribution (as a function of space) of an underlying random process
(spatial ﬁeld)? The answer is in the afﬁrmative for Lipschitz continuous ﬁelds 
where the accuracy of our distribution-learning method increases with the number
of observed ﬁeld samples (sampling rate). To validate our distribution-learning
method  we have created a dataset with 43 experimental trials by measuring sound-
level along a ﬁxed path using a location-unaware mobile sound-level meter.

Introduction

Learning the statistical distribution of physical ﬁelds from observed values is a fundamental task in
applications like environmental monitoring and pollution control. Consider a spatio-temporal process
X(s  t) along a path  such as in a residential neighborhood or a city boulevard  where s denotes the
location and t is the time. It is of interest to the learn the statistical distribution of X(s  t) at any point
s along the path for environment monitoring. Motivated by this application  the distribution-learning
of a Lipschitz continuous spatial ﬁeld at all locations from spatial samples of its realizations is studied.
In classical environment monitoring done by agencies such as the EPA (http://epa.gov)  the sensing
locations are assumed to be known. This is especially true when there is a dedicated ﬁxed sensing
location with associated equipment. Recently  mobile-sensing has been proposed as a way to increase
the spatial sampling density and reduce the cost of hardware Unnikrishnan and Vetterli [2013]. A
key challenge in mobile-sensing is to ascertain the exact location of sampling and it is of interest
to work with location-unaware sensing methods Kumar [2017]. While it is possible to use GPS or
wireless localization methods to estimate the location  it has energy and hardware overhead Che
et al. [2009]  Hu and Evans [2004]. We have a more fundamental question: can recently discovered
location-unaware sensing methods be used to learn the statistical distribution of X(s  t) as a function
of s? The answer is yes  and analytical and experimental results along this theme will be presented.
Let X(s  t) be a spatial ﬁeld where s ∈ P denotes the location and t ∈ R denotes time. The path P
is known  and it can be an open path or a loop. The set P represents the ﬁnite path over which the
distribution of X(s  t) has to be learned. It is assumed that |X(s  t)| ≤ b everywhere for a ﬁnite b > 0
and the ﬁeld is Lipschitz continuous; that is  |X(s  t) − X(s(cid:48)  t)| ≤ α|s − s(cid:48)| for some α > 0. The
unknown sampling locations are modeled using an unknown renewal process (directed non-uniform

random walk) as in the related literature Kumar [2017]. The sampling locations are S1  S2  . . .   SM
along the path P  where M is obtained from the stopping condition SM ≤ 1  SM +1 > 1. A renewal
process implies that θ1 := S1  θ2 := S2 − S1  . . . are independent and identically distributed. In
our setup  the distribution of θ is not known. This model is useful when there is jitter in mobile
sensor’s speed or when the sensing time-intervals are programmed to be on a renewal process. The
mobile-sensing experiment for distribution-learning is designed around N independent trials. It
is assumed that N mobile-sensing experiments  with statistically independent sampling locations
between the experiments  are conducted on the path P. Using these location-unaware samples  it is
of interest to learn the statistical distribution of X(s  t) for any point s ∈ P.
Our main results are as follows:

1. Using the classical Glivenko-Cantelli estimate  a distribution-learning method for
X(s  t)  s ∈ P is presented  where the maximum pointwise error between the cumulative

distribution function (CDF) of X(s  t) and its estimate decreases as O(cid:0)1/(nε2)(cid:1) + O(ε).

Here ε > 0 is a parameter of choice and n is the average number of samples. This result
holds in the limit when N → ∞.

2. We have conducted mobile sensing experiments with a sound-level meter. The implications
of our distribution-learning method on this custom dataset will be explored  and comparisons
between distribution-learning with a ﬁxed and a mobile sound-level meter will be presented.

To apply our distribution-learning method we have measured sound-level along a closed path in
multiple experiments. Using a portable sound-level meter  which is location-unaware  a dataset with
N = 43 trials has been created for the application of the proposed distribution-learning method.

State of the art: Classical sampling and distributed sampling have been addressed with ﬁxed sam-
pling locations  where the location of sensor is known A. J. Jerri [1977]  Marco et al.  Kumar
et al. [2011  2010]. A systematic analysis of spatial sensing with mobile sensor has been studied
in Unnikrishnan and Vetterli [2013]. Sensing of temporally ﬁxed parametric spatial ﬁelds with
location-unaware mobile sensor was ﬁrst addressed in Kumar [2016]. With location-unaware sam-
pling  interpolation methods for polynomial shapes has been reported in Pacholska et al. [2017]. With
location-unawareness  an algorithm for spatial mapping is presented in Elhami et al. [2018]. Mobile
sampling is also studied for crowdsensing application; Morselli et al. [2018] compared environmental
monitoring using a ﬁxed grid of sensors and sensors attached to vehicles. Use of vehicular sensor
networks for environmental monitoring has been studied in Atakan [2014]  Wang and Chen [2017].

2 Sensing model and spatial ﬁeld properties

In this section  modeling assumptions made on the spatial ﬁeld and the location-unaware mobile
sensor are presented. First  spatial ﬁeld properties are discussed.

Let P be a bounded-length path and s ∈ P be a point on it. Let t be time. The spatial ﬁeld of interest
is X(s  t)  s ∈ P  t ∈ R. The distribution of X(s  t) as a function of s ∈ P has to be ‘learned’
and it will be termed as the distribution-learning problem in this work. The ﬁeld X(s  t) may be
non-stationary as a function of s ∈ P which makes the distribution-learning problem non-trivial. It is
assumed that |X(s  t)| ≤ b everywhere and it is Lipschitz continuous in s  i.e. 
(cid:48) ∈ P and all t.

|X(s  t) − X(s
(cid:48)

  t)| ≤ α|s − s

(cid:48)| for all s  s

The boundedness of spatial derivative indicates that nearby points have similar ﬁeld values.
Without loss of generality  the one-dimensional path will be considered as P = [0  1]. A location-
unaware mobile sensor samples the ﬁeld X(s  t) from s = 0 to s = 1 at points generated by an
unknown renewal process. The sampling points are S1  S2  . . .   SM   while the inter-sample distances
are θ1 := S1  θ2 := S2 − S1  . . .  θM := SM − SM−1. The variables θ1  θ2  . . . are independent and
identically distributed positive random variables. For analysis purposes  it will be assumed that

0 < θ ≤ λ
n

and E(θ) =

1
n

 

(1)

where λ > 1 is ﬁnite and represents maximum speed of the sensor while the average sampling rate is
n/meter.
Since θ1  θ2  . . . are assumed to be random variables  the number of sample points realized in [0  1]
will be random. Let the random variable M be the number of readings taken in each mobile sensing
trial in the interval P = [0  1]. The variable M is given by the following stopping rule Durrett [2010]:
θ1 + θ2 + . . . + θM ≤ 1 and θ1 + θ2 + . . . + θM +1 > 1. As shown in Kumar [2017]  the conditional
average of θ conditioned on M = n is approximately 1

n. Speciﬁcally  it is known that

E[M ] ≤ n + λ − 1.

(2)
The distribution of θ1 and the values of s1  . . .   sM are not required for our distribution-learning
algorithm  which makes it a universal learning algorithm under the above assumptions. This is one of
the simplest location-unaware mobile sensor model that can be used along a path.
The entire mobile-sensing experiment is designed around N independent trials. It is assumed that the
ﬁeld samples

(cid:126)f1 := [X(S1 1  t1 1)  X(S1 2  t1 2)  . . .   X(S1 M1   t1 M1)]T ;
. . .  
(cid:126)fN := [X(SN 1  tN 1)  X(SN 2  tN 2)  . . .   X(SN MN   tN MN )]T

are available. It is assumed that the observed values in different trials are statistically independent.
Using these N different trials  it is of interest to learn the distribution of X(s  t) for any point s ∈ P.
The values of sampling locations Si j are not known. All of these sampling locations are generated
by N independent instances of the same renewal process with inter-sample spacing distribution of
θ. Thus  the vectors (cid:126)f1  . . .   (cid:126)fN are statistically independent. (Individually  each vector (cid:126)fi will be
dependent; for example  S1 2 = S1 1 + θ1 2 depends on S1 1.)

3 Spatial ﬁeld’s distribution-learning algorithm

This section will summarize our distribution-learning method and the analysis results. The values
summarized by (cid:126)f1  . . .   (cid:126)fN are available. The i-th trial results in the dataset (cid:126)fi with Mi number of
samples. Since the sample locations are unknown  error in learning the ﬁeld distribution at any given
location depends on the error in the estimation of ﬁeld values for the given location from samples
obtained by the mobile sensor. For any s ∈ [0  1]  the task is to learn the distribution of X(s  t). For
notational purposes  in a given trial  let M be the number of recorded samples. Let Mi be the number
of samples recorded during trial i and let Si j denote the location of jth sample for trial i. From
trial i  let ˆXi(s) be the estimate of ﬁeld value at the point s (corresponding to the time of the trial i).
Designing a good estimate for ˆXi(s) is a challenge in the location-unaware sensing setup. For the
distribution-learning problem  we deﬁne an estimate for X(s) from the i-th trial as

ˆXi(s) := X(si (cid:98)(Mi−1)s(cid:99)+1  ti (cid:98)(Mi−1)s(cid:99)+1).

(3)

Note that the dependence on t has been dropped in the left-hand side. This simpliﬁed notation will be
used  since the main error in distribution-learning will be due to the error in location estimate s. The
distribution is assumed to be calculated over all time. Let

FX(s)(x) = P(X(s) ≤ x)

denote the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of ﬁeld values at the location s  and let F ˆX(s)(x) =
P( ˆX(s) ≤ x) be the CDF of its estimate. Let 1(x ∈ A) be the indicator of set A. The CDF of ˆX(s)
can be obtained as the following classical Glivenko-Cantelli limit:

Our ﬁrst result establishes the error between F ˆX(s)(x) to FX(s)(x) under the previously mentioned
location-unaware sensing setup. Let fX(s)(x) be the probability density function of X(s). Then

Proof. This result establishes the closeness of CDFs of X(s) and ˆX(s) for any s ∈ [0  1]. Using
classical result from [Grimmett and Stirzaker [2001]  pg. 311]  the following result is noted:

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) > ε
F ˆX(s)(x) ≤ FX(s)(x + ε) + P(cid:16)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ˆX(s) − X(s)

When fX(s)(x) exists for every x  |FX(s)(x + ε) − FX(s)(x)| = P(x < X(s) ≤ x + ε) ≤

From (23) in Appendix A (given in the supplementary document) 

From (2)  (10)  and (11) it follows that

exists a δ(ε) > 0 such that |FX(s)(x + ε) − FX(s)(x)| ≤ δ(ε). As ε tends to zero δ(ε) tends to zero.

The second term in the upper bound is of the order O( 1

Therefore  as the sampling rate n tends to inﬁnity  FX(s)(x) converges to F ˆX(s)(x). This upper

4 Simulations for distribution-learning using location-unaware samples

To apply and conﬁrm our distribution-learning method  we consider a synthetic spatiotemporally
varying sound-level along a path for simulations. The main goal of these simulations is to verify
the accuracy of our distribution-learning method with an increase in the number of samples. The
sound-level at location s ∈ [0  1] and time t in the simulated signal is X(s  t) where 

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)1000 +

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) .

X(s  t) =

Ar(t) cos(2πfr(t)s)

It is a 10 frequency signal  where the frequencies at each sampling time-instant are generated
uniformly at random in the audible frequency range 20 Hz to 20 kHz  and where the amplitudes Ar(t)
are generated uniformly in the range [−180  180]; this interval was selected to ensure that the sound-
level lies in the usual range of 30-70 dB. Thus  in each trial among a total of N  at every sampling
instant an independent realization of the sound-level signal is used. Let ti j be the sampling instants
where i = 1  2  . . .   N and j = 1  2  . . .   mi. Here  mi is the number of samples collected in trial i.
The sound-levels for different values of ti j are independent in our simulations. If j = l(mi  s)  then
X(s  ti j) is the true sound-level which is estimated by our algorithm as ˆX(s  ti j) := X(si j  ti j)
(see (3)). Note that si j values are not known in location-unaware sensing; and  these sampling
locations are approximated as j−1
The sampling locations are obtained by randomly generated locations si 1  si 2  . . . si mi on trial
i. These locations are generated by adding independent inter-sample intervals θ with a Rayleigh
π . The mean of θ is 1/n. The sound-levels in the simulation are
distribution having a parameter 1
n
also recorded at s in each trial. These values model the recording of sound-level by a ﬁxed sensor at
the point s. The empirical CDF of sound-level and their estimates at location s are given by

for j = 1  2  . . .   mi.

where 1(x ∈ A) denotes the indicator of set A. Recall that j = l(mi  s) for the i-th trial as discussed
above. Comparisons of CDFs for various values of n and N are shown in Figure 2  where n indicates
the sampling rate and s = 1/2. As the sampling rate n increases  the number of samples recorded
during each trial increases and the error between the estimated CDF of samples obtained by mobile
sensor and the actual CDF of samples obtained by the ﬁxed sensor at location s = 1/2 reduces. When
there is a large number of trials  the error in the estimation of empirical CDFs reduces further. Thus 
the simulation results validate our distribution-learning method with location-unaware samples.

5 Experiments for sound-level estimation along a path

Sound-level is measured along the path shown in the map in Figure 3 using a sound-level meter. It is
carried along the path from the starting point 1 along the path back to point 1. Sound level meter by
BAFX products (Model no: BAFX3608) is used for this purpose. Speciﬁcations of the sound-level
meter are given in Table1. It is not equipped with GPS or any other localization tool.

Table 1: Speciﬁcations of Sound Level Meter

Range: 30-130dB Sampling Rate: 1 per sec Memory: 4700 readings Accuracy: ± 1.5 dB

Datasets: We have created two different datasets by measuring sound-level along the path shown in
Figure 3. For the ﬁrst data set denoted by Dataset1  the path is traversed with a sound-level meter. It
begins recording data at the starting point and continues collecting data along the entire path. This
acts as a location-unaware mobile sound-level meter. A static sound-level meter is used to measure
sound-level at speciﬁc locations marked in the map in Figure 3 with numbers one to nine  during
each trial. This acts as a ﬁxed sensor as the ﬁeld is measured at known locations. We have performed
43 trials along the same path in Figure 3. For the second dataset denoted by Dataset2  the path

Since the sound-level meter records samples at the rate of 1 sample per second  the spatial sampling
rate for Dataset2 is smaller than the spatial sampling rate for Dataset1. We have also emulated a ﬁxed
station at location 9 in Figure 3 using a static sensor for 10 minutes.
For experimentation  the path in Figure 3 was chosen as there is a large variation in the sound-level
along the path. The residential area is expected to be quiet compared to the region near the state
highway and residential market. The box plot for Dataset1 is illustrated in Figure 4. A box plot
displays information about the range  median  and quartiles of the data. From Figure 4  the dynamic
range of sound-level along the path is observed. The average sound-level variation is 20 dB (ratio of
100) while the dynamic range exceeds 30 dB (ratio of 1000). The main aim is to apply the distribution-
learning method on experimental data  and compare the agreement of learned distributions between a
mobile sensor and a ﬁxed sensor. The empirical distribution of sound-level obtained from the mobile
sound-level meter deﬁned in (21) and the empirical distribution of sound-level obtained from the ﬁxed
sensor deﬁned in (21) that measures sound-level at locations marked with numbers 1-9 in Figure 3 is
compared. Figure 5a shows the comparison of empirical CDFs of experimental data from Dataset1
at location 5 in Figure 3. The error in the empirical distributions computed using samples from the

ﬁxed sensor and the mobile sensor in Dataset1 is small as shown in Figure 5a. This shows that the
sound-level distribution at any location on a path can be learned using location-unaware samples.
To check the distribution-learning method at two different sampling rates of the mobile sound-level
meter  the empirical CDF of sound-level deﬁned by (21) (at location 9 in Figure 3) using a ﬁxed
sensor and empirical CDF of sound-level obtained by mobile sensors deﬁned by (21) are compared.
This comparison is done at two different sampling rates  obtained from Dataset1 and Dataset2. The
CDFs are plotted in Figure 5. From Figure 5(b) and (c) the accuracy in learning the distribution is
better for Dataset1 (higher spatial sampling rate) as compared to Dataset2 (lower spatial sampling
rate). The accuracy of the distribution-learning method increases with spatial sampling rate. The
decrease in maximum pointwise error in learned CDF with n is also shown in Theorems 1 and 2.

6 Conclusions

In this work  we proposed a data-driven method for learning the statistical distribution of a Lipschitz
continuous spatial ﬁeld along a path. The samples used were obtained at unknown-locations generated
by an unknown renewal process. The accuracy of the proposed distribution-learning method increases
with the spatial sampling rate of the mobile sensor. Simulation and experimental results support
this claim. A method to learn the variation of distribution with time needs be developed if the ﬁeld
is temporally varying in nature. The ﬁeld was assumed to be one dimensional and a single mobile
sensor was used to sample. Use of multiple location-unaware mobile sensors for sampling 2-D ﬁelds
can be studied in the future.
