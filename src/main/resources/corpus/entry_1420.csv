Abstract

Time delay is pervasive in neural information processing. To achieve real-time
tracking  it is critical to compensate the transmission and processing delays in a
neural system. In the present study we show that dynamical synapses with short-
term depression can enhance the mobility of a continuous attractor network to the
extent that the system tracks time-varying stimuli in a timely manner. The state
of the network can either track the instantaneous position of a moving stimulus
perfectly (with zero-lag) or lead it with an effectively constant time  in agreement
with experiments on the head-direction systems in rodents. The parameter regions
for delayed  perfect and anticipative tracking correspond to network states that are
static  ready-to-move and spontaneously moving  respectively  demonstrating the
strong correlation between tracking performance and the intrinsic dynamics of the
network. We also ﬁnd that when the speed of the stimulus coincides with the
natural speed of the network state  the delay becomes effectively independent of
the stimulus amplitude.

1 Introduction

Time delay is pervasive in neural information processing. Its occurrence is due to the time for signals
to transmit in the neural pathways  e.g.  50-80 ms for electrical signals to propagate from the retina
to the primary visual cortex [13]  and the time for neurons responding to inputs  which is in the
order of 10-20 ms. Delay is also inevitable for neural information processing. For a neural system
carrying out computations in the temporal domain  such as speech recognition and motor control 
input information needs to be integrated over time  which necessarily incur delays.
To achieve real-time tracking of fast moving objects  it is critical for a neural system to compensate
for the delay; otherwise  the object position perceived by the neural system will lag behind the
true object position considerably. A natural way to compensate for delays is to predict the future
position of the moving stimulus. Experimental ﬁndings suggested that delay compensations are
widely adopted in neural systems. A remarkable example is the head-direction (HD) systems in
rodents  which encode the head direction of a rodent in the horizontal plane relative to a static
environment [14  17]. It was found that when the head of a rodent is moving continuously in space 
the direction perceived by the HD neurons in the postsubicular cortex has nearly zero-lag with
respect to the instantaneous position of the rodent head [18]. More interestingly  in the anterior
dorsal thalamic nucleus  the HD neurons perceive the future direction of the rodent head  leading the
current position by a constant time [3]. The similar anticipative behavior is also observed in the eye-
position neurons when animals make saccadic eye movement  the so-called saccadic remapping [16].
In human psychophysical experiments  the classic ﬂash-lag effect also supports the notion of delay

compensation [12].
In the experiment  a ﬂash is perceived to lag behind a moving object  even
though they are physically aligned. The underlying cause is that the visual system predicts the
future position of the continuously moving object  but is unable do so for the unpredictable ﬂash.
Depending on the available information  the brain may employ different strategies for delay com-
pensation. In the case of self-motion  such as an animal rotating its head actively or performing
saccadic eye movements  the motor command responsible for the motion can serve as a cue for
delay compensation. It was suggested that an efference copy of the motor command  called corol-
lary discharge  is sent to the corresponding internal representation system prior to the motion [18].
For the head rotation  the advanced time can be up to 20 ms; for the saccadic eye movement  the
advanced time is about 70 ms. In the case of tracking an external moving stimulus  the neural sys-
tem has to rely on the moving speed of the stimulus for prediction. Asymmetric neural interactions
have been proposed to drive the network states to catch up with changes in head directions [22] or
positions [4]. These may be achieved by the so-called conjunctive cells projecting neural signals
between successive modules in forward directions [10]. To explain the ﬂash-lag effect  Nijhawan et
al. proposed a dynamical routing mechanism to compensate the transmission delay in the visual sys-
tem  in which retinal neurons dynamically choose a pathway according to the speed of the stimulus 
and transmit the signal directly to the future position in the cortex [13].
In this study we propose a novel mechanism of how a neural system compensates for the processing
delay. By the processing delay  we mean the time consumed by a neural system in response to
external inputs. The proposed mechanism does not require corollary discharge  or efforts of choosing
signal pathways  or speciﬁc network structures such as asymmetric interactions or conjunctive cells.
It is based on the short-term depression (STD) of synapses  the inherent and ubiquitous nature that
the synaptic efﬁcacy of a neuron is reduced after ﬁring due to the depletion of neurotransmitters [11].
It has been found that STD enhances the mobility of the states of neural networks [21  9  6]. The
underlying mechanism is that neurotransmitters become depleted in the active region of the network
states compared with the neighboring regions  thus increasing the likelihood of the locally active
network state to shift to its neighboring positions when it is tracking a continuously shifting stimulus.
When STD is sufﬁciently strong  the tracking state of the network can even overtake the moving
stimulus  demonstrating its potential for generating predictions.

2 The Model

We consider continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs) as the internal representation models
for continuous stimuli [7  2  15]. A CANN holds a continuous family of bump-shaped stationary
states  which form a subspace in which the neural system is neutrally stable [20]. This property
endows the neural system the capacity of tracking time-varying stimuli smoothly.
Consider a continuous stimulus x being encoded by a neural ensemble. The variable x may represent
the orientation  the head direction  or the spatial location of an object. Neurons with preferred stimuli
x produce the maximum response when an external stimulus is present at x. Their preferred stimuli

the neural ensemble can be described by a CANN. We denote as u(x; t) the population-averaged
synaptic current to the neurons at position x and time t. The dynamics of u(x; t) is determined
by the external input  the lateral interactions among the neurons  and its relaxation towards zero
response. It is given by

be located anywhere in the space x.
Next  we consider the case that the network receives a moving input

Without loss of generality  we consider the stimulus position at time t = 0 to be z0 = 0  and the
stimulus moves at a constant speed thereafter  i.e.  z0 = vt for t (cid:21) 0. Let s (cid:17) z(t) (cid:0) z0(t) be the
displacement between the network state and the stimulus position. It has been shown that without
STD  the steady value of the displacement is determined by [5]

Note that s has the opposite sign of v  implying that the network state always trails behind the

3 Tracking in the Presence of STD

The analysis of tracking in the presence of STD is more involved. Motivated by the nearly Gaussian-
shaped proﬁle of the network states  we adopt a perturbation approach to solve the network dynam-
ics [5]. The key idea is to expand the network states as linear combinations of a set of orthonormal
basis functions corresponding to different distortion modes of the bump  that is

Here  Hn is the nth-order Hermite polynomial function.  n (x (cid:0) z) and ϕn (x (cid:0) z) have clear phys-
ical meanings. For instance  for n = 1; 2; 3; 4  they corresponds to  respectively  the height  the
position  the width and the skewness changes of the Gaussian bump. Depending on the approxima-
tion precision  we can take the above expansions up to a proper order  and substituting them into
Eqs. (1) and (2) to solve the network dynamics analytically.
Results obtained from the 11th order perturbation are shown in Fig. 2(a) for three representa-
tive cases. They depend on the rescaled inhibition (cid:22)k (cid:17) k=kc and the rescaled STD strength
(cid:22)(cid:12) (cid:17) (cid:28)d(cid:12)=((cid:26)2J 2
0 ). When STD is weak  the tracking state lags behind the stimulus. When the
STD strength increases to a critical value (cid:22)(cid:12)perfect  s becomes effectively zero in a rather broad range
of stimulus velocity  achieving perfect tracking. When the STD strength is above the critical value 
the tracking state leads the stimulus.
Hence delay compensation in a tracking task can be implemented at two different levels. The ﬁrst
one is perfect tracking  in which the tracking state has zero-lag with respect to the true stimulus
position independent of the stimulus speed. The second one is anticipative tracking  in which the
tracking state leads by a constant time (cid:28)ant relative to the stimulus position  that is  the tracking state
is at the position the stimulus will travel to at a later time (cid:28)ant. To achieve a constant anticipation
time  it requires the leading displacement to increase with the stimulus velocity proportionally  i.e. 
s = v(cid:28)ant. Both forms of delay compensation have been observed in the head-direction systems of
rodents  and may serve different functional purposes.

3.1 Prefect Tracking

To analyze the parameter regime for perfect tracking  it is instructive to consider the 1st order per-
turbation of the network dynamics  i.e.

At the steady state  d(cid:22)u0=dt = dp0=dt = dp1=dt = 0  and dz=dt = v. Furthermore  for a sufﬁciently
small displacements  i.e.  jsj=a ≪ 1  one can approximate (cid:22)A exp[(cid:0)(vt (cid:0) z)2=(8a2)] (cid:25) (cid:22)A and
(cid:22)A[(vt (cid:0) z)=a] exp[(cid:0)(vt (cid:0) z)2=(8a2)] (cid:25) (cid:0) (cid:22)As=a. Solving the above equations  we ﬁnd that s=a
can be expressed in terms of the variables (cid:22)u0= (cid:22)A  (cid:28)s=(cid:28)d and v(cid:28)d=a. When v(cid:28)d=a ≪ 1  the rescaled
displacement s=a can be approximated by a power series expansion of the rescaled velocity v(cid:28)d=a.
Since the displacement reverses sign when the velocity reverses  s=a is an odd function of v(cid:28)d=a.
This means that s=a (cid:25) c1(v(cid:28)d=a) + c3(v(cid:28)d=a)3. For perfect tracking in the low velocity limit  we
have c1 = 0 and ﬁnd

where C is a parameter less than 1 (the detailed expression can be found in Supplementary Material).
For the network tracking a moving stimulus  the input magnitude cannot be too small. This means
that (cid:22)u0= (cid:22)A is not a large number. Therefore  for tracking speeds up to v(cid:28)d=a (cid:24) 1  the displacement
s is very small and can be regarded as zero effectively (see Fig. 2(a)). The velocity range in which
the tracking is effectively perfect is rather broad  since it scales as ((cid:28)d=(cid:28)s)1=3 ≫ 1.
Equation (18) is valid when (cid:22)(cid:12) takes a particular value. This ields an extimate of (cid:22)(cid:12)perfect in the 1st
order perturbation. Its expression is derived in Supplementary Material and plotted in Fig. 2(b).
For reference  we also plot the boundary that separates the metastatic phase above it from the static
phase below  as reported in the study of intrinsic properties of CANNs with STD in [6]. In the static
phase  the bump is stable at any position  whereas in the metastatic phase  the static bump starts to
move spontanaeously once it is pushed. Hence we say that the phase boundary is in a ready-to-move
state. Fig. 2(b) shows that (cid:22)(cid:12)perfect is just above the phase boundary. Indeed  when (cid:22)A approaches
0  the expression of (cid:22)(cid:12)perfect reduces to the value of (cid:22)(cid:12) along the phase boundary for the 1st order

different values of (cid:22)k. This implies that the network with (cid:22)(cid:12) = (cid:22)(cid:12)perfect exhibits effectively perfect
tracking performance because it is intrinsically in a ready-to-move state.

3.2 Anticipative Tracking

We further explore the network dynamics when the STD strength is higher than that for achieving
perfect tracking. By solving the network dynamics with the perturbation expansion up to the 11th
order  we obtain the relation between the displacement s and the stimulus speed v. The solid curve in
Fig. 2(a) shows that for strong STD  s increases linearly with v over a broad range of v. This implies
that the network achieves a constant anticipatory time (cid:28)ant over a broad range of the stimulus speed.
To gain insights into how the anticipation time depends on the stimulus speed  we consider the
regime of small displacements.
In this regime  the rescaled displacement s=a can be approxi-
mated by a power series expansion of the rescaled velocity v(cid:28)d=a  leading to s=a = c1(v(cid:28)d=a) +
c3(v(cid:28)d=a)3. The coefﬁcients c1and c3 are determined such that the anticipation time in the limit
v = 0 should be (cid:28)ant(0) = s=v  and that s=a reaches a maximum when v = vmax. This yields the
result

This shows that the anticipation time is effectively constant in a wide range of stimulus velocities  as
shown in Fig. 3(a). Even for v = 0:5vmax  the anticipation time is only reduced from its maximum
by 9%.
The contours of anticipatory times for slowly moving stimuli are shown in Fig. 3(b). Hence the
region of anticipative behavior effectively coincides with the metastatic phase  as indicated by the
region above the phase line (dashed) in Fig. 2(b). In summary  there is a direct correspondence
between delayed  perfect  and anticipative tracking on one hand  and the static  ready-to-move  and
spontaneously moving beahviors on the other. This demonstrates the strong correlation between the
tracking performance and the intrinsic behaviors of the CANN.

yield a slope of 0:41 at the origin and the maximum lead at vmax(cid:28)d=a = 1:03. This result can be

3.3 Natural Tracking

For strong enough STD  a CANN holds spontaneously moving bump states. The speed of the
spontaneously moving bump is an intrinsic property of the network depending only on the network
parameters. We call this the natural speed of the network  denoted as vnatural. An interesting issue is
the tracking performance of the network when the stimulus is moving at its natural speed.
Two sets of curves corresponding to two values of (cid:22)(cid:12) are shown in Fig. 4  when the stimulus am-
plitude (cid:22)A is sufﬁciently strong. The lines L1 and L2 indicate the corresponding natural speeds of
the system for these values of (cid:22)(cid:12). Remarkably  we obtain a conﬂuence point of these curves at the
natural speed. This point is referred to as the natural tracking point. It has the important property
that the lag is independent of the stimulus amplitude. This independence of s from (cid:22)A persists in the
asymptotic limit of large (cid:22)A. In this limit  s approaches (cid:0)vnatural(cid:28)s   corresponding to a delay time
of (cid:28)s  showing that the response is limited by the synaptic time scale in this limit. This asymptotic
limit is described by the line L3 and is identical for all values of (cid:22)k and (cid:22)(cid:12). Hence the invariant point
for natural tracking is given by (v; s) = (vnatural;(cid:0)vnatural(cid:28)s) for all values of (cid:22)k and (cid:22)(cid:12).
We also consider natural tracking in the weak (cid:22)A limit. Again we ﬁnd a conﬂuence point of the
displacement curves at the natural speed  but the delay time (and in some cases the anticipation
time) depends on the value of (cid:22)k. For example  at (cid:22)k = 0:3  the natural tracking point traces out an
effectively linear curve in the space of v and s when (cid:22)(cid:12) increases  with a slope equal to 0:8(cid:28)s. This
shows that the delay time is 0:8(cid:28)s  effectively independent of (cid:22)(cid:12) at (cid:22)k = 0:3. Since the delay time is
different from the value of (cid:28)s applicable in the strong (cid:22)A limit  the natural tracking point is slowly
drifting from the weak to the strong (cid:22)A limit. However  the magnitude of the natural time delay
remains of the order of (cid:28)s. This is conﬁrmed by the analysis of the dynamical equations when the
stimulus speed is vnatural + (cid:14)v in the weak (cid:22)A limit.

3.4 Extension to other CANNs

To investigate whether the delay compensation behavior and the prediction of the natural tracking
point are general features of CANN models  we consider a network with Mexican-hat couplings.

Parameter: (cid:12) = 0:003. (b) Natural speed of the network as a function of (cid:12). (c) Plot of s against v.
There is a conﬂuence point at the natural speed of the system. L1: the natural speed of the system
at (cid:12) = 0:0011. Common parameters: (cid:26) = 128= (2(cid:25)) ; J0 = 0:5 and a = 0:5.

Fig. 5 shows that the network exhibits the same behaviors as the model in Eqs. (1) and (2). As
shown in Fig. 5(a)  the anticipatory times are effectively constant and similar in magnitude in the
range of stimulus speed comparable to experimental settings. In Fig. 5(b)  the natural speed of the
bump is zero for (cid:12) less than a critical value. As (cid:12) increases  the natural speed increases from zero.
In Fig. 5(c)  the displacement s is plotted as a function of the stimulus speed v. The invariance
of the displacement at the natural speed  independent of the stimulus amplitude  also appears in
the Mexican-hat model. The conﬂuence point of the family of curves is close to the natural speed.
Furthermore  the displacement at the natural tracking point increases with the natural speed.

4 Conclusions

In the present study we have investigated a simple mechanism of how processing delays can be com-
pensated in neural information processing. The mechanism is based on the intrinsic dynamics of a
neural circuit  utilizing the STD property of neuronal synapses. The latter induces translational in-
stability of neural activities in a CANN and enhances the mobility of the network states in response
to external inputs. We found that for strong STD  the neural system can track moving stimuli with
either zero-lag or a lead of a constant time. The conditions for perfect and anticipative tracking hold
for a wide range of stimulus speeds  making them applicable in practice. By choosing biologically
plausible parameters  our model successfully justiﬁes the experimentally observed delay compen-
sation behaviors. We also made an interesting prediction in the network dynamics  that is  when
the speed of the stimulus coincides with the natural speed of the network state  the delay becomes
effectively independent of the stimulus amplitude. We also studied more than one kind of CANN
models to conﬁrm the generality of our results.
Compared with other delay compensation strategies relying on corollary discharge or dynamical
routing  the mechanism we propose here is fully dependent on the intrinsic dynamics of the network 
namely  the network automatically “adjusts” its tracking speed according to the input information.
There exists strong correlations between tracking performance and the intrinsic dynamics of the
network. The parameter regions for delayed  perfect and anticipative tracking correspond to network
states being static  ready-to-move and spontaneously moving  respectively. It has been suggested the
anticipative response of HD neurons in anterior dorsal thalamus is due to the corollary discharge of
motor neurons responsible for moving the head. However  experimental studies revealed that when
rats were moved passively (and hence no corollary discharge is available)  either by hand or by a
chart  the anticipative response of HD neurons still exists and has an even larger leading time [1].
Our model provides a possible mechanism to describe this phenomenon.
