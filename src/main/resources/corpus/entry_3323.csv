Abstract

Computing the partition function (i.e.  the normalizing constant) of a given pair-
wise binary graphical model is NP-hard in general. As a result  the partition
function is typically estimated by approximate inference algorithms such as be-
lief propagation (BP) and tree-reweighted belief propagation (TRBP). The former
provides reasonable estimates in practice but has convergence issues. The later
has better convergence properties but typically provides poorer estimates. In this
work  we propose a novel scheme that has better convergence properties than BP
and provably provides better partition function estimates in many instances than
TRBP. In particular  given an arbitrary pairwise binary graphical model  we con-
struct a speciﬁc “attractive” 2-cover. We explore the properties of this special
cover and show that it can be used to construct an algorithm with the desired
properties.

Introduction

Graphical models provide a mechanism for expressing the relationships among a collection of vari-
ables. Many applications in computer vision  coding theory  and machine learning can be reduced
to performing statistical inference  either computing the partition function or the most likely conﬁg-
uration  of speciﬁc graphical models. In general models  both of these problems are NP-hard. As
a result  much effort has been invested in designing algorithms that can approximate  or in some
special cases exactly solve  these inference problems.
The belief propagation algorithm (BP) is an efﬁcient message-passing algorithm that is often used
to approximate the partition function of a given graphical model. However  BP does not always
converge  and so-called convergent message-passing algorithms such as tree reweighted belief prop-
agation (TRBP) have been proposed as alternatives to BP. Such convergent message passing algo-
rithms can be viewed as dual coordinate-descent schemes on a particular convex upper bound on the
partition function [1]. While TRBP-style message-passing algorithms guarantee convergence under
suitable message-passing schedules  ﬁnding the optimal message-passing schedule can be cumber-
some or impractical depending on the application  and TRBP often performs worse than BP in terms
of estimating the partition function.
The primary goal of this work is to study alternatives to BP and TRBP that have better convergence
properties than BP and approximate the partition function better than TRBP. To that end  the so-
called “attractive” graphical models (i.e.  those models that do not contain frustrated cycles) stand
out as a special case. Attractive graphical models have desirable computational properties: Weller
and Jebara [2  3] describe a polynomial time approximation scheme to minimize the Bethe free
energy of attractive models (note that BP only guarantees convergence to a local optimum).
In
addition  BP has much better convergence properties on attractive models than on general pairwise
binary models [4  5].

In this work  we show how to approximate the inference problem over a general pairwise binary
graphical model as an inference problem over an attractive graphical model. Similar in spirit to
the work of Bayati et al. [6] and Ruozzi and Tatikonda [7]  we will use graph covers in order to
better understand the behavior of the Bethe approximation with respect to the partition function. In
particular  we will show that if a graphical model is strictly positive and contains even one frustrated
cycle  then there exists a choice of external ﬁeld and a 2-cover without frustrated cycles whose
partition function provides a strict upper bound on the partition function of the original model.
We then show that the computation of the Bethe partition function can approximated  or in some
cases found exactly  by computing the Bethe partition function over this special cover. The required
computations are easier on this “attractive” graph cover as computing the MAP assignment can be
done in polynomial time and there exists a polynomial time approximation scheme for computing
the Bethe partition function.
We illustrate the theory through a series of experiments on small models  grid graphs  and vertex in-
duced subgraphs of the Epinions social network1  . All of these models have frustrated cycles which
make the computation of their partition functions  marginals  and most-likely conﬁgurations exceed-
ingly difﬁcult. In these experiments  the proposed scheme converges signiﬁcantly more frequently
than BP and provides a better estimate of the partition function than TRBP.

2 Prerequisites

We begin by reviewing pairwise binary graphical models  graph covers  the Bethe and TRBP ap-
proximations  and recent work on lower bounds.

2.1 Pairwise Binary Graphical Models
Let f : {0  1}n → R≥0 be a non-negative function. A function f factors with respect to a graph
G = (V  E)  if there exist potential functions φi : {0  1} → R≥0 for each i ∈ V and ψij : {0  1}2 →
R≥0 for each (i  j) ∈ E such that

f (x1  . . .   xn) =

φi(xi)

ψij(xi  xj).

(cid:89)

i∈V

(cid:89)

(i j)∈E

The graph G together with the collection of potential functions φ and ψ deﬁne a graphical model
that we will denote as (G; φ  ψ). For clarity  we will often denote the corresponding function as
f (G;φ ψ)(x). For a given graphical model (G; φ  ψ)  we are interested in computing the partition

function Z(G; φ  ψ) (cid:44)(cid:80)

x∈{0 1}|V |(cid:81)

i∈V φi(xi)(cid:81)

(i j)∈E ψij(xi  xj).

We will also be interested in computing the maximum value of f  sometimes referred to as the
MAP problem. The problem of computing the MAP solution can be converted into the problem
of computing the partition function by adding a temperature parameter  T   and taking the limit as
T → 0.

Here  φ1/T is the collection of potentials generated by taking each potential φi(xi) and raising it to
the 1/T power for all i ∈ V  xi ∈ {0  1}.

2.2 Graph Covers

Graph covers have played an important role in our understanding of statistical inference in graphical
models [8  9]. Roughly speaking  if a graph H covers a graph G  then H looks locally the same as
G.
Deﬁnition 2.1. A graph H covers a graph G = (V  E) if there exists a graph homomorphism
h : H → G such that for all vertices i ∈ G and all j ∈ h−1(i)  h maps the neighborhood ∂j of j in
H bijectively to the neighborhood ∂i of i in G.

1In the Epinions network  users are connected by agreement and disagreement edges and therefore frus-
trated cycles abound. By treating the network as a pairwise binary graphical model  we may compute the
trustworthiness of a user by performing marginal inference over a variable representing if the user is trusted or
not.

Figure 1: An example of a graph cover. The nodes in the cover are labeled for the node that they
copy in the base graph.
If h(j) = i  then we say that j ∈ H is a copy of i ∈ G. Further  H is said to be an M-cover of G
if every vertex of G has exactly M copies in H. For an example of a graph cover  see Figure 1. For
a connected graph G = (V  E)  each M-cover consists of M copies of each of the variable nodes
of G with an edge joining each distinct copy of i ∈ V to a distinct copy of j ∈ V if and only if
(i  j) ∈ E.
To any M-cover H = (V H   EH ) of G given by the homomorphism h  we can associate a collection
of potentials: the potential at node i ∈ V H is equal to φh(i)  the potential at node h(i) ∈ G  and
for each (i  j) ∈ EH  we associate the potential ψh(i j). In this way  we can construct a function
f (H;φH  ψH ) : {0  1}M|V | → R≥0 such that f (H;φH  ψH ) factorizes over H. We will say that the
graphical model (H; φH   ψH ) is an M-cover of the graphical model (G; φ  ψ) whenever H is an
M-cover of G and φH and ψH are derived from φ and ψ as above.

2.3 The Bethe Partition Function

The Bethe free energy is a standard approximation to the so-called Gibbs free energy that is mo-
tivated by ideas from statistical physics. TRBP and more general reweighted belief propagation
algorithms take advantage of a similar approximation.
For τ in the local marginal polytope 
T (cid:44){τ ≥ 0 | ∀(i  j) ∈ E 

τij(xi  xj) = τi(xi) and ∀i ∈ V 

τi(xi) = 1}.

the reweighted free energy approximation at temperature T = 1 is given by

where U is the energy

Here  ρij controls the reweighting over the edge (i  j) in the graphical model.
If ρij = 1 for
all (i  j) ∈ E  then we call this the Bethe approximation and will typically drop the ρ writing
ZB (cid:126)1 = ZB. The reweighted partition function is then expressed in terms of the minimum value
achieved by this approximation over T as follows.

ZB ρ(G; φ  ψ) = e− minτ∈T FB ρ(G τ ;φ ψ)

Similar to the exact partition function computation  the reweighted partition function at temperature
T is given by ZB ρ(G; φ1/T   ψ1/T )T . The zero temperature limit corresponds to minimizing the
energy function over the local marginal polytope.
In practice  local optima of these free energy approximations can be found by a reweighted version of
belief propagation. The ﬁxed points of this reweighted algorithm correspond to stationary points of
log ZB(G  τ ; φ  ψ) over T [10]. The TRBP algorithm chooses the vector ρ such that ρij corresponds
to the edge appearance probability of (i  j) over a convex combination of spanning trees. For these
choices of ρ  the reweighted free energy approximation is convex in τ  ZB ρ(G; φ  ψ) is always
larger than the true partition function and there exists an ordering of the message updates so that
reweighted belief propagation is guaranteed to converge.

2.4 Log-Supermodularity and Lower Bounds

A recent theorem of Vontobel [8] provides a combinatorial characterization of the Bethe partition
function in terms of graph covers.
Theorem 2.2 (8).

ZB(G; φ  ψ) = lim sup

M→∞ M

Z(H; φH   ψH )

|CM (G)|

(cid:118)(cid:117)(cid:117)(cid:116) (cid:88)

H∈CM (G)

where CM (G) is the set of all M-covers of G.
This characterization suggests that bounds on the partition functions of individual graph covers can
be used to bound the Bethe partition function. This approach has recently been used to prove that the
Bethe partition function provides a lower bound on the true partition function in certain nice families
of graphical models [8  11  12]. One such nice family is the family of so-called log-supermodular
(aka attractive) graphical models.
Deﬁnition 2.3. A function f : {0  1}n → R≥0 is log-supermodular if for all x  y ∈ {0  1}n
where (x ∧ y)i = min{xi  yi} and (x ∨ y)i = max{xi  yi}. Similarly  f is log-submodular if the
inequality is reversed for all x  y ∈ {0  1}n.
Theorem 2.4 (Ruozzi [11]). If (G; φ  ψ) is a log-supermodular graphical model  then for any M-
cover  (H; φH   ψH )  of (G; φ  ψ)  Z(H; φH   ψH ) ≤ Z(G; φ  ψ)M .
Plugging this result into Theorem 2.2  we can conclude that the Bethe partition function always
lower bounds the true partition function in log-supermodular models.

f (x)f (y) ≤ f (x ∧ y)f (x ∨ y)

3 Switching Log-Supermodular Functions

Let (G; φ  ψ) be a pairwise binary graphical model. Each ψij  in this model  is either log-
supermodular  log-submodular  or both. In the case that each ψij is log-supermodular  Theorem
2.4 says that the partition function of the disconnected 2-cover of G provides an upper bound on the
partition function of any other 2-cover of G.
When the ψij are not all log-supermodular  this is not necessarily the case. As an example  if G is
a 3-cycle  then  up to isomorphism  G has two distinct covers: the 6-cycle and the graph consisting
of two disconnected 3-cycles. Consider the pairwise binary graphical model for the independent set
problem on G = (V  E) given by the edge potentials ψij(xi  xj) = 1 − xixj for all (i  j) ∈ E. We
can easily check that the 6-cycle has 18 distinct independent sets while the disconnected cover has
only 16 independent sets. That is  the disconnected 2-cover does not provide an upper bound on the
number of independent sets in all 2-covers.
Sometimes graphical models that are not log-supermodular can be converted into log-supermodular
models by performing a simple change of variables (e.g.  for a ﬁxed I ⊆ V   a change of variables
that sends xi (cid:55)→ 1 − xi for each i ∈ I and xi (cid:55)→ xi for each i ∈ V \ I). As a change of variables
does not change the partition function  we can directly apply Theorem 2.4 to the new model. We will
call such functions switching log-supermodular. These functions are the log-supermodular analog
of the “switching supermodular” and “permuted submodular” functions considered by Crama and
Hammer [13] and Schlesinger [14] respectively.
The existence of a 2-cover whose partition function is larger than the disconnected one is not unique
to the problem of counting independent sets. Such a cover exists whenever the base graphical model
is not switching log-supermodular. In this section  we will describe one possible construction of a
speciﬁc 2-cover that is distinct from the disconnected 2-cover whenever the given graphical model
is not switching log-supermodular and will always provide an upper bound on the true partition
function.

3.1 Signed Graphs

In order to understand when a graphical model can be converted into a log-supermodular model
by switching some of the variables  we introduce the notion of a signed graph. A signed graph is

potentials. Here  dashed lines represent edges with log-submodular potentials. The graph in (b) is

to the graph in (c). Note that the graph in (b) is connected while the graph in (d) is not.

a graph in which each edge has an associated sign. For our graphical models  we will use a “+”
to represent a log-supermodular edge and a “−” to represent a log-submodular edge. The sign of
a cycle in the graph is positive if it has an even number of “−” edges and negative otherwise. A
signed graph is said to be balanced if there are no negative cycles. Equivalently  a signed graph is
balanced  if we can divide its vetices into two sets A and B such that all edges in the graph with
one endpoint in set A and the other endpoint in the set B are negative and the remaining edges are
positive [15]. Switching  or ﬂipping  a variable as above has the effect of ﬂipping the sign of all
edges adjacent to the corresponding variable node in the graphical model: ﬂipping a single variable
converts an incident log-supermodular edge into a log-submodular edge and vice versa. A graphical
model is switching log-supermodular if and only if its signed graph is balanced.
Signed graphs have been studied before in the context of graphical models. Watanabe [16] charac-
terized signed graphs for which belief propagation is guaranteed to have a unique ﬁxed point. These
results depend only on the graph structure and the signs on the edges and not on the strength of the
potentials.

3.2 Switching Log-Supermodular 2-covers

We can always construct a 2-cover of a pairwise binary graphical model that is switching log-
supermodular.
Deﬁnition 3.1. Given a pairwise binary graphical model (G; φ  ψ)  construct a 2-cover 
(G2; φG2

) where G2 = (V G2

)  as follows.

  ψG2

  EG2

• For each i ∈ G  create two copies of i  denoted i1 and i2  in V G2.
• For each edge (i  j) ∈ E  if ψij is log-supermodular  then add the edges (i1  j1) and (i2  j2)

to EG2. Otherwise  add the edges (i1  j2) and (i2  j1) to EG2.

G2 is switching log-supermodular. This follows from the characterization of Harary [15] as G2 can
be divided into two sets V1 and V2 with only negative edges between the two partitions and positive
edges elsewhere. See Figure 2 for an example of this construction.
If all of the potentials in (G; φ  ψ) are log-supermodular  then G2 is equal to the disconnected 2-
cover of G. If all of the potentials in (G; φ  ψ) are log-submodular  then G2 is a bipartite graph.
Lemma 3.2. For a connected graph G  (G2; φG2
) is disconnected if and only if f (G;φ ψ) is
switching log-supermodular. Equivalently  G2 is disconnected if and only if the signed version of G
is balanced.

  ψG2

Returning to the example of counting independent sets on a 3-cycle at the beginning of this section 
we can check that G2 for this graphical model corresponds to the 6-cycle. The observation that the
6-cycle has more independent sets than two disconnected copies of the 3-cycle is a special case of a
general theorem.

The proof of Theorem 3.3 can be found in Appendix A of the supplementary material. Unlike
Theorem 2.4 that provides lower bounds on the partition function  Theorem 3.3 provides an upper
bound on the partition function.

4 Properties of the Cover G2

In this section  we study the implications that Theorem 2.4 and Theorem 3.3 have for characteriza-
tions of switching log-supermodular functions and the computation of the Bethe partition function.

4.1 Field Independence

We begin with the simple observation that Theorem 3.3  like Theorem 2.4  does not depend on the
choice of external ﬁeld. In fact  in the case that all of the edge potentials are strictly larger than zero 
this independence of external ﬁeld completely characterizes switching log-supermodular graphical
models.
Theorem 4.1. For a pairwise binary graphical model (G; φ  ψ) with strictly positive edge potentials
ψ  the following are equivalent.

1. f (G;φ ψ)(x) is switching log-supermodular.

2. For all M ≥ 1  any external ﬁeld (cid:98)φ  and any M-cover (H;(cid:98)φH   ψH ) of (G;(cid:98)φ  ψ) 
Z(H;(cid:98)φH   ψH ) ≤ Z(G;(cid:98)φ  ψ)M .
3. For all choices of the external ﬁeld (cid:98)φ and any 2-cover (H;(cid:98)φH   ψH ) of (G;(cid:98)φ  ψ) 
Z(H;(cid:98)φH   ψH ) ≤ Z(G;(cid:98)φ  ψ)2.
one negative cycle  then there exists an external ﬁeld(cid:98)φ and a 2-cover (H;(cid:98)φH   ψH ) of (G;(cid:98)φ  ψ) such
that Z(G;(cid:98)φ  ψ)2 < Z(H;(cid:98)φH   ψH ). In particular  the proof of the theorem shows that there exists an
external ﬁeld (cid:98)φ such that Z(G;(cid:98)φ  ψ)2 < Z(G2;(cid:98)φG2

In other words  if all of the edge potentials are strictly positive  and the graphical model has even

). See Appendix B in the supplementary

material for a proof of Theorem 4.1.

4.2 Bethe Partition Function of Graph Covers

Although the true partition function of an arbitrary graph cover could overestimate or underestimate
the true partition function of the base graphical model  the Bethe partition function on every cover
always provides an upper bound on the Bethe partition function of the base graph.
In addition 
the reweighted free energy is always convex for an appropriate choice of parameters ρT RBP which
means that ZB ρT RBP (G; φ  ψ)2 = ZB ρT RBP (G2; φG2

). Consequently 

  ψG2

ZB ρT RBP (G; φ  ψ)2 ≥ Z(G2; φG2

  ψG2

) ≥ ZB(G2; φG2

  ψG2

) ≥ ZB(G; φ  ψ)2.

(1)

  ψG2

Because the graph cover G2 is switching log-supermodular  the convergence properties of BP are
better [5]  and we can always apply the PTAS of Weller and Jebara [3] to (G2; φG2
) in order
to obtain an upper bound on the Bethe partition function of the original model. That is  by forming
the special graph cover G2  we accomplished our stated goal of deriving an algorithm that produces
better estimates of the partition function than TRBP but has better convergence properties than BP.
We examine the convergence properties experimentally in Section 5.
Before we evaluate the empirical properties of this strategy  observe that (1) holds for the MAP
inference problem as well. In the zero temperature limit  computing the Bethe partition function is
equivalent to minimizing the energy over the local marginal polytope. Many provably convergent
message-passing algorithms have been designed for this speciﬁc task [17  18  19  1].
By Theorem 3.3  the MAP solution on (G2; φG2
) is always at least as good as the MAP so-
lution on the original graph. The problem of ﬁnding the MAP solution for a log-supermodular
pairwise binary graphical model is exactly solvable in strongly polynomial time using max-ﬂow

  ψG2

6

[20  21]. We can show that the optimal solution to the Bethe approximation in the zero temperature
limit is attained as an integral assignment on this speciﬁc 2-cover. The argument goes as follows.
The graphical model (G2; φG2
) is switching log-supermodular. By Theorem 2.4  in the zero
temperature limit  no MAP solution on any cover of (G2; φG2
) can attain a higher value of the
objective function. This means that

  ψG2

By (1)  the Bethe approximation on (G2; φG2
) is at least as good as the Bethe approximation
on the original problem. In fact  they are equivalent in the zero temperature limit: the only part of
the Bethe approximation that is not necessarily convex in τ is the entropy approximation  which
becomes negligible as T → 0.
As a consequence  we can compute the optimum of the Bethe free energy in the zero temperature
limit in polynomial time without relying on convergent message-passing algorithms. This is partic-
ularly interesting as the local marginal polytope for pairwise binary graphical models has an integer
persistence property. Given any fractional optimum τ of the energy  U  over the local marginal poly-
tope  if τi(0) > τi(1)  then there exists an integer optimum τ(cid:48) in the marginal polytope such that
τ(cid:48)(0) > τ(cid:48)(1) [22]. A similar result holds when the strict inequality is reversed. Therefore  we can
compute both the Bethe optimum and partial solutions to the exact MAP inference problem simply
by solving a max-ﬂow problem over (G2; φG2
In this restricted setting  the two cover G2 is essentially the same as the graph construction produced
as part of the quadratic pseudo-boolean optimization (QPBO) algorithm in the computer vision
community [23]. In this sense  we can view the technique presented in this work as a generalization
of QPBO to approximate the partition function of pairwise binary graphical models.

5 Experimental Results

In this section  we present several experimental results for the above procedure. For the experiments 
we used a standard implementation of reweighted  asynchronous message passing starting from a
random initialization and a damping factor of .9. We test the performance of these algorithms on
Ising models with a randomly selected external ﬁeld and various interaction strengths on the edges.
We do not use the convergent version of TRBP as the message update order is graph dependent
and not as easily parallelizable as the reweighted message-passing algorithm [1]. In addition  alter-
native message-passing schemes that guarantee convergence tend to converge slower than damped
reweighted message passing [24]. In some cases where the TRBP parameter choices do not con-
verge  additional damping does help but does not allow convergence within the speciﬁed number of
iterations.
The ﬁrst experiment was conducted on a complete cycle on four nodes. The convergence properties
of BP have been studied both theoretically and empirically by Mooij and Kappen [5]. As expected 
TRBP provides a looser bound on the partition function than BP on the 2-cover and both typically
perform worse in terms of estimation than BP on the original graph (when BP converges there).
The experimental results are described in Figure 3. In all cases  the algorithms were run until the
messages in consecutive time steps differed by less than 10−8 or until more than 20  000 iterations
were performed (a single iteration consists of updating all of the messages in the model). In general 
BP on the 2-cover construction converges more quickly than both BP and TRBP on the original
graph. BP failed to converge as the interaction strength decreased past −.9. The number of iterations
required for convergence of BP on the 2-cover has a spike at the ﬁrst interaction strength such that

ZB(G) (cid:54)=(cid:112)ZB(G2). Empirically  this occurs because of the appearance of new BP ﬁxed points on

the two cover that are close to the BP ﬁxed point on the original graph. As the interaction strength
increases past this point  the new ﬁxed points further separate from the old ﬁxed points and the
algorithm converges signiﬁcantly faster.
Our second set of experiments evaluates the practical performance of these three message-passing
schemes for Ising models on frustrated grid graphs (which arise in computer vision problems)  sub-
networks of the Epinions social network (the speciﬁc subnetworks tested can be found in Appendix
D of the supplementary material)  and simple four layer graphical models with ﬁve nodes per layer

Figure 4: Percent of samples on which each algorithm converged within 1000 iterations and the
average number of iterations for convergence for 100 samples of edges weights in [−a  a] for the
designated graphs. For TRBP  performance was poor independent of the spanning trees selected.
similar to those used to model “deep” belief networks (layer i and layer i + 1 form a complete bi-
partite graph and there are no intralayer edges). In the Epinions network  the pairwise interactions
correspond to trust relationships. If our goal was to ﬁnd the most trusted users in the network  then
we could  for example  compute the marginal probability that each user is trusted and then rank the
users by these probabilities. For each of these models  the edge weights are drawn uniformly at
random from the interval [−a  a]. The performance of BP  TRBP  and BP on the 2-cover continue to
behave as they did for the simple four node model: as a increases  BP fails to converge and BP on the
2-cover converges much faster and more frequently than the other methods. Here  convergence was
required to an accuracy of 10−8 within 1  000 iterations. The results for the different graphs appear
in Figure 4. Notably  both BP and TRBP perform poorly on the real networks from the Epinions
data set.
