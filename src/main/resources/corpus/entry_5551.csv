Abstract

Association ﬁeld models have attempted to explain human contour grouping per-
formance  and to explain the mean frequency of long-range horizontal connections
across cortical columns in V1. However  association ﬁelds only depend on the
pairwise statistics of edges in natural scenes. We develop a spectral test of the suf-
ﬁciency of pairwise statistics and show there is signiﬁcant higher order structure.
An analysis using a probabilistic spectral embedding reveals curvature-dependent
components.

Introduction

Natural scene statistics have been used to explain a variety of neural structures. Driven by the
hypothesis that early layers of visual processing seek an efﬁcient representation of natural scene
structure  decorrelating or reducing statistical dependencies between subunits provides insight into
retinal ganglion cells [17]  cortical simple cells [13  2]  and the ﬁring patterns of larger ensembles
[18]. In contrast to these statistical models  the role of neural circuits can be characterized function-
ally [3  14] by positing roles such as denoising  structure enhancement  and geometric computations.
Such models are based on evidence of excitatory connections among co-linear and co-circular neu-
rons [5]  as well as the presence of co-linearity and co-circularity of edges in natural images [8] 
[7]. The fact that statistical relationships have a geometric structure is not surprising: To the extent
that the natural world consists largely of piecewise smooth objects  the boundaries of those objects
should consist of piecewise smooth curves.
Common patterns between excitatory neural connections  co-occurrence statistics  and the geometry
of smooth surfaces suggests that the functional and statistical approaches can be linked. Statistical
questions about edge distributions in natural images have differential geometric analogues  such as
the distribution of intrinsic derivatives in natural objects. From this perspective  previous studies
of natural image statistics have primarily examined “second-order” differential properties of curves;
i.e.  the average change in orientation along curve segments in natural scenes. The pairwise statistics
suggest that curves tend toward co-linearity  in that the (average) change in orientation is small.
Similarly  for long-range horizontal connections  cells with similar orientation preference tend to be
connected to each other.
Is this all there is? From a geometric perspective  do curves in natural scenes exhibit continuity in
curvatures  or just in orientation? Are edge statistics well characterized at second-order? Does the
same hold for textures?
To answer these questions one needs to examine higher-order statistics of natural scenes  but this
is extremely difﬁcult computationally. One possibility is to design specialized patterns  such as in-
tensity textures [16]  but it is difﬁcult to generalize such results into visual cortex. We make use
of natural invariances in image statistics to develop a novel spectral technique based on preserving

a probabilistic distance. This distance characterizes what is beyond association ﬁeld models (dis-
cussed next) to reveal the “third-order” structure in edge distributions. It has different implications
for contours and textures and  more generally  for learning.

Figure 1: Outline of paper: We construct edge maps from a large database of natural images  and
estimate the distribution of edge triplets. To visualize this distribution  we construct an embedding
which reveals likely triplets of edges. Clusters in this embedded space consist of curved lines

2 Edge Co-occurrence Statistics

Edge co-occurrence probabilities are well studied [1  8  6  11]. Following them  we use random
variables indicating edges at given locations and orientations. More precisely  an edge at position 
orientation ri = (xi  yi  θi)  denoted Xri  is a {0  1} valued random variable. Co-occurrence statis-
tics examine various aspects of pairwise marginal distributions  which we denote by P (Xri  Xrj ).
The image formation process endows scene statistics with a natural translation invariance. If the
camera were allowed to rotate randomly about the focal axis  natural scene statistics would also
have a rotational invariance. For computational convenience  we enforce this rotational invariance
by randomly rotating our images. Thus 

P (Xr1   ...  Xrn ) = P (XT (r1)  ...  XT (rn))

where T is a roto-translation.
We can then estimate joint distributions of nearby edges by looking at patches of edges centered at
a (position  orientation) location rn and rotating the patch into a canonical orientation and position
that we denote r0. Let T (rn) = r0. Then

P (Xr1   ...  Xrn ) = P (XT (r1)  ...  Xr0)

Several examples of statistics derived from the distribution of P (Xri  Xr0) are shown in Fig. 2.
These are pairwise statistics of oriented edges in natural images. The most important visible feature
of these pairwise statistics is that of good continuation: Conditioned on the presence of an edge at
the center  edges of similar orientation and horizontally aligned with the edge at the center have high
probability. Note that all of the above implicitly or explicit enforced rotation invariance  either by

Figure 2: Association ﬁelds derive from image co-occurrence statistics. Here we show three attempts
to characterize them. Different authors consider probabilities or likelihoods; Elder further conditions
on boundaries. We simply interpret them as illustrating the probability (likelihood) of an edge near
a horizontal edge at the center position.

sumption of Elder et. al. Conditional independence is one of several possible pairwise distributional
assumptions. Intuitively  however  the second triple is much more likely. We examine third-order

only examining relative orientation with respect to a reference orientation or by explicit rotation of
the images.
It is critical to estimate the degree to which these pairwise statistics characterize the full joint dis-
tribution of edges (Fig. 3). Many models for neural ﬁring patterns imply relatively low order joint
statistics. For example  spin-glass models [15] imply pairwise statistics are sufﬁcient  while Markov
random ﬁelds have an order determined by the size of neighborhood cliques.

3 Contingency Table Analysis

To test whether the joint distribution of edges can be well described by pairwise statistics  we
performed a contingency table analysis of edge triples at two different threshold levels from im-
ages in the van Hataran database. We computed estimated joint distributions for each triple of
edges in an 11 × 11 × 8 patch  not constructed to have an edge at the center. Using a χ2
test  we computed the probability that each edge triple distribution could occur under hypothesis
H0 : {No three way interaction}. This is a test of the hypothesis that

log P (Xri   Xrj   Xrk ) = f (Xri  Xrj ) + g(Xrj   Xrk ) + h(Xri  Xrk )

for each triple (Xri  Xrj   Xrk )  and includes the cases of independent edges  conditionally indepen-
dent edges  and other pairwise interactions. For almost all triples  this probability was extremely
small. (The few edge triples for which the null hypothesis cannot be rejected consisted of edges that
were spaced very far apart  which are far more likely to be nearly statistically independent of one
another.)

4 Counting Triple Probabilities

We chose a random sampling of black and white images from the van Hataren image dataset[10].
They were randomly rotated and then ﬁltered using oriented Gabor ﬁlters covering 8 angles from
[0  π). Each Gabor has a carrier period of 1.5 pixels per radian and an envelope standard deviation
of 5 pixels. The ﬁlters were convolved in near quadrature pairs  squared and summed.

Figure 4: Example image (a) and edges (b) for statistical analysis. Note: color corresponds to
orientation

To restrict analysis to the statistics of curves  we applied local non-maxima suppression across ori-
entation columns in a direction normal to the given orientation. This threshold is a heuristic attempt
to exclude non-isolated curves due to dense textures. We note that previous studies in pairwise edge
statistics have used similar heuristics or hand labeling of edges to eliminate textures. The resulting
edge maps were subsampled to eliminate statistical dependence due to overlapping ﬁlters.
Thresholding the edge map yields X : U → {0  1}  where U ⊂ R2 ×S is a discretization of R2 ×S.
We treat X as a function or a binary vector as convenient. We randomly select 21 × 21 × 8 image
patches with an oriented edge at the center  and denote these characteristic patches by Vi
Since edges are signiﬁcantly less frequent than their absence  we focus on (positive) edge co-
occurrence statistics. For simplicity  we denote P (Xri = 1  Xrj = 1  Xrk = 1) by E[XriXrj Xrk ].
In addition  we will denote the event Xri = 1 by Yri. (A small orientation anisotropy has been
reported in natural scenes (e.g.  [9])  but does not appear in our data because we effectively averaged
over orientations by randomly rotating the images.)
We compute the matrix M + where

where Vi is a (vectorized) random patch of edges centered around an edge with orientation θi = 0.
In addition  we only compute pairwise probabilities for edges of high marginal probability (Fig. 5)

5 Visualizing Triples of Edges

By analogy with the pairwise analysis above  we seek to ﬁnd those edge triples that frequently co-
occur. But this is signiﬁcantly more challenging. For pairwise statistics  one simply ﬁxes an edge to
lie in the center and “colors” the other edge by the joint probability of the co-occurring pair (Fig. 2).
No such plot exists for triples of edges. Even after conditioning  there are over 12 million edge
triples to consider.
Our trick: Embed edges in a low dimensional space such that the distance between the edges rep-
resents the relative likelihood of co-occurrence. We shall do this in a manner such that distance in
Embedded Space ∼ Relative Probability.
As before  let Xri be a binary random variable  where Xri = 1 means there is an edge at location
ri = (xi  yi  θi). We deﬁne a distance between edges

The ﬁrst and the last terms represent pairwise co-occurrence probabilities; i.e.  these are the asso-
ciation ﬁeld. The middle term represents the interaction between Xri and Xrj conditioned on the
presence of X0. Thus this distance is zero if the edges always co-occur in images  given the hori-
zontal edge at the origin  and is large if the pair of edges frequently occur with the horizontal edge
but rarely together. (The relevance to learning is discussed below.)
We will now show how  for natural images  edges can be placed in a low dimensional space where
the distance in that space will be proportional to this probabilistic distance.

6 Dimensionality Reduction via Spectral Theorem

We exploit the fact that M + is symmetric and introduce the spectral expansion

M + =

where φl is an eigenvector of M +.

The Euclidean distance between embedded points is then

Φ maps edges to points in an embedded space where squared distance is equal to relative probability.
The usefulness of this embedding comes from the fact that the spectrum of M + decays rapidly
(Fig. 6). Therefore we truncate Φ  including only dimensions with high eigenvalues. This gives a
dramatic reduction in dimensionality  and allows us to visualize the relationship between triples of
edges (Fig. 7). In particular  a cluster  say  C  of edges in embedding space all have high probability
of co-occurring  and the diameter of the cluster

bounds the conditional co-occurrence probability of all edges in the cluster.

Edge distributions. The eigenvectors of M + are used to color both the edges and the embedding.
The color in each ﬁgure can be interpreted as a coordinate given by one of the φ vectors. Edges that
share colors (coordinates) in all dimensions (φ2  φ3  φ4) are close in probabilistic distance  which
implies they have a high probability of co-occurring along with the edge in the center. Compare with
Fig. 2 where red edges all have high probability of occurring with the center  but no information is
known about their co-occurrence probability.

where p = mini E(Xri|Yr0). For our embeddings p > .2 see Fig. 5.
To highlight information not contained in the association ﬁeld  we normalized our probability matrix
by its row sums  and removed all low-probability edges. Embedding the mapping from R2 × S →
Rm reveals the cocircular structure of edge triples in the image data (Fig. 7). The colors along each
column correspond  so similar colors map to nearby points along the dimension corresponding to
the row. Under this dimensionality reduction  each small cluster in diffusion space corresponds to
half of a cocircular ﬁeld. In effect  the coloring by φ2 shows good continuation in orientation (with
our crude quantization) while the coloring by φ4 shows co-circular connections. In effect  then  the

third-order structure away. We used 40 000 (21 × 21 × 8) patches.
Shown in Fig. 7 are low dimensional projections of the diffusion map and their corresponding color-
ings in R2 × S. To provide a neural interpretation of these results  let each point in R2 × S represent
a neuron with a receptive ﬁeld centered at the point (x  y) with preferred orientation θ. Each cluster
then signiﬁes those neurons that have a high probability of co-ﬁring given that the central neuron
ﬁres  so clusters in diffusion coordinates should be “wired” together by the Hebbian postulate. Such
curvature-based facilitation can explain the non-monotonic variance in excitatory long-range hori-
zontal connections in V1 [3  4]. It may also have implications for the receptive ﬁelds of V2 neurons.
As clusters of co-circular V1 cells are correlated in their ﬁring  it may be efﬁcient to represent them
with a single cell with excitatory feedforward connections. This predicts that efﬁcient coding models
that take high order interactions into account should exhibit cells tuned to curved boundaries.

Implications for Inhibition and Texture

Our approach also has implications beyond excitatory connections for boundary facilitation. We
repeated our conditional spectral embedding  but now conditioned on the absence of an edge at the
center (Fig. 8). This could provide a model for inhibition  as clusters of edges in this embedding
are likely to co-occur conditioned on the absence of an edge at the center. We ﬁnd that the embed-
ding has no natural clustering. Compared to excitatory connections  this suggests that inhibition is
relatively unstructured  and agrees with many neurobiological studies.

Figure 8: Embeddings conditioned on the absence of an edge at the center location. Note how
less structured it is  compared to the positive embeddings. As such it could serve as a model for
inhibitory connections  which span many orientations.

Finally  we repeated this third-order analysis (but without local non-maxima suppression) on a struc-
tured model for isotropic textures on 3D surfaces and again found a curvature dependency (Fig. 9).
Every 3-D surface has a pair of associated dense texture ﬂows in the image plane that correspond to
the slant and tilt directions of the surface. For isotropic textures  the slant direction corresponds to
the most likely orientation signaled by oriented ﬁlters.
As this is a representation of a dense vector ﬁeld  it is more difﬁcult to interpret than the edge map.
We therefore applied k-means clustering in the embedded space and segmented the resulting vector
ﬁeld. The resulting clusters show two-sided continuation of the texture ﬂow with a ﬁxed tangential
curvature (Fig. 10).
In summary  then  we have developed a method for revealing third-order orientation structure by
spectral methods. It is based on a diffusion metric that makes third-order terms explicit  and yields
a Euclidean distance measure by which edges can be clustered. Given that long-range horizontal
connections are consistent with these clusters  how biological learning algorithms converge to them
remains an open question. Given that research in computational neuroscience is turning to third-
order [12] and specialized interactions  this question now becomes more pressing.

along with the edge in the center.
