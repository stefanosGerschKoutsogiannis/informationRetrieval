Abstract

Brain connectivity analysis is a critical component of ongoing human connectome
projects to decipher the healthy and diseased brain. Recent work has highlighted
the power-law (multi-time scale) properties of brain signals; however  there remains
a lack of methods to speciﬁcally quantify short- vs. long- time range brain connec-
tions. In this paper  using detrended partial cross-correlation analysis (DPCCA) 
we propose a novel functional connectivity measure to delineate brain interactions
at multiple time scales  while controlling for covariates. We use a rich simulated
fMRI dataset to validate the proposed method  and apply it to a real fMRI dataset
in a cocaine dependence prediction task. We show that  compared to extant meth-
ods  the DPCCA-based approach not only distinguishes short and long memory
functional connectivity but also improves feature extraction and enhances classi-
ﬁcation accuracy. Together  this paper contributes broadly to new computational
methodologies in understanding neural information processing.

Introduction

Brain connectivity is crucial to understanding the healthy and diseased brain states [15  1]. In recent
years  investigators have pursued the construction of human connectomes and made large datasets
available in the public domain [23  24]. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has been
widely used to examine complex processes of perception and cognition. In particular  functional
connectivity derived from fMRI signals has proven to be effective in delineating biomarkers for many
neuropsychiatric conditions [15].
One of the challenges encountered in functional connectivity analysis is the precise deﬁnition of
nodes and edges of connected brain regions [21]. Functional nodes can be deﬁned based on activation
maps or with the use of functional or anatomical atlases. Once nodes are deﬁned  the next step is to
estimate the weights associated with the edges. Traditionally  these functional connectivity weights
are measured using correlation-based metrics. Previous simulation studies have shown that they can
be quite successful  outperforming higher-order statistics (e.g. linear non-gaussian acyclic causal
models) and lag-based approaches (e.g. Granger causality) [20].
On the other hand  very few studies have investigated the power-law cross-correlation properties
(equivalent to multi-time scale measures) of brain connectivity. Recent research suggested that fMRI

signals have power-law properties (e.g. their power-spectrum follows a power law) [8  3] and that the
deviations from the typical range of power-exponents have been noted in neuropsychiatric disorders
[11]. For instance  in [3]  using wavelet-based multivariate methods  authors observed that scale-free
properties are characteristic not only of univariate fMRI signals but also of pairwise cross-temporal
dynamics. Moreover  they found an association between the magnitude of scale-free dynamics and
task performance. We hypothesize that power-law correlation measures may capture additional
dimensions of brain connectivity not available from conventional analyses and thus enhance clinical
prediction.
In this paper  we aim to answer three key open questions: (i) whether and how brain networks are
cross-correlated at different time scales with long-range dependencies (“long-memory” process 
equivalent to power-law in the frequency domain); (ii) how to extract the intrinsic association between
two regions controlling for the inﬂuence of other interconnected regions; and (iii) whether multi-time
scale connectivity measures can improve clinical prediction. We address the ﬁrst two questions
by using the detrended partial cross-correlation analsyis (DPCCA) coefﬁcient [25]  a measure that
quantiﬁes correlations on multiple time scales between non-stationary time series  as is typically the
case with task-related fMRI signals. DPCCA is an extension of detrended cross-correlation analysis
[17  13]  and has been successfully applied to analyses of complex systems  including climatological
[26] and ﬁnancial [18] data. Unlike methods based on ﬁltering particular frequency bands  DPCCA
directly informs correlations across multiple time scales  and unlike wavelet-based approaches (e.g.
cross wavelet transformation and wavelet transform coherence [2])  DPCCA has the advantage of
estimating pairwise correlations controlling for the inﬂuence of other regions. This is critical because
brain regions and thus fMRI signals thereof are highly interconnected. To answer the third question 
we use the correlation proﬁles  generated from DPCCA  as input features for different machine
learning methods in classiﬁcation tasks and compare the performance of DPCCA-based features with
all other competing features.
In Section 2  we describe the simulated and real data sets used in this study  and show how features
of the classiﬁcation task are extracted from the fMRI signals. In Section 3  we provide further details
about DPCCA (Section 3.1)  and present the proposed multi-time scale functional connectivity mea-
sure (Section 3.2). In Section 4  we describe core experiments designed to validate the effectiveness
of DPCCA in brain connectivity analysis and clinical prediction. We demonstrate that DPCCA
(i) detects connectivity at multiple-time scales while controlling for covariates (Sections 4.1 and
4.3)  (ii) accurately identiﬁes functional connectivity in well-known gold-standard simulated data
(Section 4.2)  and (iii) improves classiﬁcation accuracy of cocaine dependence with fMRI data of
seventy-ﬁve cocaine dependent and eighty-eight healthy control individuals (Section 4.4). In Section
5  we conclude by highlighting the signiﬁcance of the study as well as the limitations and future
work.

2 Material and Methods

2.1 Simulated dataset: NetSim fMRI data

We use fMRI simulation data - NetSim [20] - previously developed for the evaluation of network
modeling methods. Simulating rich and realistic fMRI time series  NetSim is comprised of twenty-
eight different brain networks  with different levels of complexity. These signals are generated
using dynamic causal modeling (DCM [6])  a generative network model aimed to quantify neuronal
interactions and neurovascular dynamics  as measured by the fMRI signals. NetSim graphs have 5
to 50 nodes organized with “small-world” topology  in order to reﬂect real brain networks. NetSim
signals have 200 time points (mostly) sampled with repetition time (TR) of 3 seconds. For each
network  50 separate realizations (“subjects”) are generated. Thus  we have a total of 1400 synthetic
dataset for testing. Finally  once the signals are generated  white noise of standard deviation 0.1-1%
is added to reproduce the scan thermal noise.

2.2 Real-world dataset: Cocaine dependence prediction

Seventy-ﬁve cocaine dependent (CD) and eighty-eight healthy control (HC) individuals matched in
age and gender participated in this study. CD were recruited from the local  greater New Haven area
in a prospective study and met criteria for current cocaine dependence  as diagnosed by the Structured
Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. They were drug-free while staying in an inpatient treatment unit.

The Human Investigation committee at Yale University School of Medicine approved the study  and
all subjects signed an informed consent prior to participation. In the MR scanner  they performed a
simple cognitive control paradigm called stop-signal task [14]. FMRI data were collected with 3T
Siemens Trio scanner. Each scan comprised four 10-min runs of the stop signal task. Functional
blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals were acquired with a single-shot gradient echo
echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence  with 32 axial slices parallel to the AC-PC line covering the
whole brain: TR=2000 ms  TE=25 ms  bandwidth=2004 Hz/pixel  ﬂip angle=85◦  FOV=220×220
mm2  matrix=66×64  slice thickness=4 mm and no gap. A high-resolution 3D structural image
(MPRAGE; 1 mm resolution) was also obtained for anatomical co-registration. Three hundred
images were acquired in each session. Functional MRI data was pre-processed with standard pipeline
using Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12) (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience 
University College London  U.K.).

2.2.1 Brain activation

We constructed general linear models and localized brain regions responding to conﬂict (stop signal)
anticipation (encoded by the probability P(stop)) at the group level [10]. The regions responding to
P(stop) comprised the bilateral parietal cortex  the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the right middle
frontal gyrus (MFG); and regions responding to motor slowing bilateral insula  the left precentral
cortex (L.PC)  and the supplementary motor area (SMA) (Fig. 1(a))2. These regions of interest (ROIs)
were used as masks to extract average activation time courses for functional connectivity analyses.

2.2.2 Functional connectivity

We analyzed the frontoparietal circuit involved in conﬂict anticipation and response adjustment using
a standard Pearson correlation analysis and multivariate Granger causality analysis or mGCA [19]. In
Fig. 1(b)  we illustrate ﬁfteen correlation coefﬁcients derived from the six ROIs for each individual
CD and HC as shown in Fig. 1(a). According to mGCA  connectivities from bilateral parietal to L.PC
and SMA were disrupted in CD (Fig. 1(b)). These ﬁndings offer circuit-level evidence of altered
cognitive control in cocaine addiction.

3 A Novel Measure of Brain Functional Connectivity

3.1 Detrended partial cross-correlation analysis (DPCCA)

Detrended partial cross-correlation is a novel measure recently proposed by [25]. DPCCA combines
the advantages of detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA) [17] and standard partial correlation.
Given two time series {x(a)} {x(b)} ∈ Xt  where Xt ∈ IRm  t = 1  2  ...  N time points  DPCCA is
given by Equation 1:

ρDP CCA(a  b; s) =

i=1 xi and Yt =(cid:80)t

The partial sums (proﬁles) are obtained with sliding windows across the integrated time series
i=1 yi. For each time window j with size s  detrended covariances

and variances are computed according to Equations 5-6:

where s is the time scale and each term Ca b(s) is obtained by inverting the matrix ρ(s)  e.g.
C(s) =ρ−1(s). The coefﬁcient ρa b ∈ ρ(s) is the so called DCCA coefﬁcient [13]. The DCCA
coefﬁcient is an extension of the detrented cross correlation analysis [17] combined with detrended
ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) [12].
Given two time series {x}  {y} ∈ Xt (indices omitted for the sake of simplicity) with N time
points and time scale s  DCCA coefﬁcient is given by Equation 2:

where (cid:91)Xt j and (cid:100)Yt j are polynomial ﬁts of time trends. We used a linear ﬁt as originally proposed

[13]  but higher order ﬁts could also be used [25]. DCCA can be used to measure power-law
cross-correlations. However  we focus on DCCA coefﬁcient as a robust measure to detect pairwise
cross-correlation in multiple time scales  while controlling for covariates. Importantly  DPCCA
quantiﬁes correlations among time series with varying levels of non-stationarity [13].

3.2 DPCCA for functional connectivity analysis

In this section  we propose the use of DPCCA as a novel measure of brain functional connectivity.
First  we show in simulation experiments that the measure satisﬁes desired connectivity properties.
Further  we deﬁne the proposed connectivity measure. Although these properties are expected by
mathematical deﬁnition of DPCCA  it is critical to conﬁrm its validity on real fMRI data. Additionally 
it is necessary to establish the statistical signiﬁcance of the computed measures at the group level.

3.2.1 Desired properties

Given real fMRI signals  the measure should accurately detect the time scale in which the pairwise
connections occur  while controlling for the covariates. To verify this  we create synthetic data by
combining real fMRI signals and sinusoidal waves (Fig. 2). To simplify  we assume additive property
of signals and sinusoidal waves reﬂecting the time onset of the connections. For each simulation  we
randomly sample 100 sets of time series or “subjects”.
a) Distinction of short and long memory connections. Given two fMRI signals {xA}  {xB}  we
derive three pairs with known connectivity proﬁles: short-memory {XA = xA + sin(T1) + e} 
{XB = xB + sin(T1) + e}  long-memory {XA = xA + sin(T2) + e}  {XB = xB +
sin(T2) + e} and mixed {XA = xA + sin(T1) + sin(T2) + e}  {XB = xB + sin(T1) +
sin(T2) + e}  where T1 << T2 and e is a Gaussian signal to simulate measurement noise. We
hypothesize that the two nodes A and B are functionally connected at time scales T1 and T2.

b) Control for covariates. Given three fMRI signals {xA}  {xB}  {xC}  we derive three signals
with known connectivity {XAC = xA+xC +sin(T )+e}  {XBC = xB +xC +sin(T )+e} 
{XC = xC + e}  where e is the measurement noise. We hypothesize that the two nodes A and B
are functionally connected mostly at scale T  once the mutual inﬂuence of node C is controlled.

nals generated by combining real fMRI sig-
nals and sinusoidal waves. (a) Original fMRI
signals  (b) original signals with sin(T =
10s) and sin(T = 30s) waves added.

3.2.2 Statistical signiﬁcance

Given two nodes and their time series  we assume that they are functionally connected if the
max |ρDP CCA|  within a time range srange  is signiﬁcantly greater than the null distribution.
Empirical null distributions are estimated from the original data by randomly shufﬂing time series
across different subjects and nodes  as proposed in [20]. In this way  we generate realistic distributions
of connectivity weights occurring by chance. Since we have a multivariate measure  the null dataset
is always generated with the same number of nodes as the tested network. Multiple comparisons are
controlled by estimating the false discovery rate. Importantly  the null distribution is also computed on
max |ρDP CCA| within the time range srange. We use a srange from 6 to 18 seconds  assuming
that functional connections transpire in this range. Thus  we allow connections with different
time-scales. We use this binary deﬁnition of functional connectivity for the current approach to be
comparable with other methods  but it is also possible to work with the whole temporal proﬁle of
ρDP CCA(s)  as is done in the classiﬁcation experiment (Section 4.4). To keep the same statistical
criteria  we also generate null distributions for all the other connectivity measures.

3.2.3 DPCCA + Canonical correlation analysis

As further demonstrated by simulation results (Table 1)  DPCCA alone has lower true positive rate
(TPR) compared to other competing methods  likely because of its restrictive statistical thresholds. In
order to increase the sensitivity of DPCCA  we augmented the method by including an additional
canonical correlation analysis (CCA) [7]. CCA was previously used in fMRI in different contexts
to detect brain activations [5]  functional connectivity [27]  and for multimodal information fusion
[4]. In short  given two sets of multivariate time series {XA(t) ∈ IRm  t = 1  2  ...  N} and
{XB(t) ∈ IRn  t = 1  2  ...  N}  where m and n are the respective dimensions of the two sets
A and B  and N is the number of time points  CCA seeks the linear transformations u and v so that
the correlation between the linear combinations XA(t)u and XB(t)v is maximized. In this work 
we propose the use of CCA to deﬁne the existence of a true connection  in addition to the DPCCA
connectivity results. The proposed method is summarized in Algorithm 1. With CCA (Lines 8-14) 
we identify the nodes that are strongly connected after linear transformations. In Line 18  we use
CCA to inform DPCCA in terms of positive connections.

4 Experiments and Results

4.1 Connectivity properties: Controlling time scales and covariates

In Figure 3  we observe that DPCCA successfully captured the time scales of the correlations
between time series {XA}  {XB}  despite the noisy nature of fMRI signals. For instance  it
distinguished between short and long-memory connections  represented using T1 = 10s and
T2 = 30s  respectively (Figs. 3a-c). Importantly  it clearly detected the peak connection at 10s after
controlling for the inﬂuence of covariate signal XC (Fig. 3f). Further  unlike DPCCA  the original
DCCA method did not rule out the mutual inﬂuence of XC with peak at 30s (Fig. 3e).

4.2 Simulated networks: Improved connectivity accuracy

The goal of this experiment is to validate the proposed methods in an extensive dataset designed
to test functional connectivity methods. In this dataset  ground truth networks are known with the
architectures aimed to reﬂect real brain networks. We use the full NetSim dataset comprised of
28 different brain circuits and 50 subjects. For each sample of time series  we compute the partial
correlation (parCorr) and the regularized inverse covariance (ICOV)  reported as the best performers
in [20]  as well as the proposed DPCCA and DPCCA+CCA methods. For each measure  we construct
empirical null distributions  as described in Section 3.2.2  and generate the binary connectivity matrix
using threshold α = 0.05. To evaluate their connectivity accuracy  given the ground truth networks 
we compute the true positive and negative rates (TPR and TNR  respectively) and the balanced
accuracy BAcc= (T P R+T N R)
Using NetSim fMRI data as the testing benchmark  we observed that the proposed DPCCA+CCA
method provided more accurate functional connectivity results than the best methods reported in the
original paper [20]. Results are summarized in Table 1. Here we use the balanced accuracy (BAcc)

connections.

4.3 Real-world dataset: Learning connectivity temporal proﬁles

We use unsupervised methods to (i) learn representative temporal proﬁles of connectivity from
DPCCAF ull  and (ii) perform dimensionality reduction. The use of temporal proﬁles may capture
additional information (such as short- and long-memory connectivity). However  it increases the
feature set dimensionality  imposing additional challenges on classiﬁer training  particularly with
small dataset. The ﬁrst natural choice for this task is principal component analysis (PCA)  which can
represent original features by their linear combination. Additionally  we use two popular non-linear
dimensionality reduction methods Isomap [22] and autoencoders [9]. With Isomap  we attempt to
learn the intrinsic geometry (manifold) of the temporal proﬁle data. With autoencoders  we seek to
represent the data using restricted Boltzmann machines stacked into layers.
In Figure 4  we show some representative correlation proﬁles obtained by computing DPPCA
among frontoparietal regions (circuit presented in Fig. 1)  and the ﬁrst three principal components.
Interestingly  PCA seemed to learn some of the characteristic temporal proﬁles. For instance  as
expected  the ﬁrst components captured the main trend  while the second components captured some
of the short (task-related) and long (resting-state) memory connectivity trends (Figs.4a-b).

4.4 Real-world dataset: Cocaine dependence prediction

The classiﬁcation task consists of predicting the class membership  cocaine dependence (CD) and
healthy control (HC)  given each individual’s fMRI data. After initial preprocessing (Section 2.2)  we
extract average time series within the frontoparietal circuit of 6 regions 3 (Figure 1)  and compute
the different cross-correlation measures. These coefﬁcients are used as features to train and test
(leave-one-out cross-validation) a set of popular classiﬁers available in scikit-learn toolbox [16]
(version 0.18.1)  including k-nearest neighbors (kNN)  support vector machine (SVM)  multilayer
perceptron (MLP)  Gaussian processes (GP)  naive Bayes (NB) and the ensemble method Adaboost
(Ada). For the DPCCA coefﬁcients  we test both peak values DPCCAmax as well as the rich
temporal proﬁles DPCCAF ull. Finally  we also include the brain activation maps (Section 2.2.1) as
feature set  thus allowing comparison with popular fMRI classiﬁcation softwares such as PRONTO
(http://www.mlnl.cs.ucl.ac.uk/pronto/). Features are summarized in Table 2.

3Although these regions are obtained from the whole-group  no class information is used to avoid inﬂated

classiﬁcation rates.

balanced accuracy (BAcc). Here we tested all features described in Table 2  including the DPCCA full
proﬁles after dimensionality reduction (Isomap  autoencoders and PCA). Activation maps produced
poor classiﬁcation results (P(stop): 0.525±0.048 and UPE: 0.509±0.032)  comparable to the results
obtained with PRONTO software using the same features (accuracy 0.556).

Table 3: Comparison of classiﬁcation results for different
features. The DPCCA features combined with PCA produced
the top classiﬁers according to both criteria (0.963/0.911).
However  DPCCAP CA is not statistically better than ParCorr
or ICOV (Wilcoxon signed paired test  p>0.05). See Figure 5
for accuracy across different classiﬁcation methods.

5 Conclusions

In summary  as a multi-time scale approach to characterize brain connectivity  the proposed method
(DPCCA+CCA) (i) identiﬁed connectivity peak-times (Fig. 3)  (ii) produced higher connectivity
accuracy than the best competing method ICOV (Table 1)  and (iii) distinguished short/long memory
connections between brain regions involved in cognitive control (IFC&SMA and SMA&PC) (Fig.
4). Second  using the connectivity weights as features  DPCCA measures combined with PCA
produced the highest individual accuracies (Table 3). However  it was not statistically different
from the second best feature (ParCorr) across different classiﬁers. Further separate test set would be
necessary to identify the best classiﬁers. We performed extensive experiments with a large simulated
fMRI dataset to validate DPCCA as a promising functional connectivity analytic. On the other
hand  our conclusions on clinical prediction (classiﬁcation task) are still limited to one case. Finally 
further optimization of Isomap and autoencoders methods could improve the learning of connectivity
temporal proﬁles produced by DPCCA.
