Abstract

Variational methods are frequently used to approximate or bound the partition
or likelihood function of a Markov random ﬁeld. Methods based on mean ﬁeld
theory are guaranteed to provide lower bounds  whereas certain types of convex
relaxations provide upper bounds. In general  loopy belief propagation (BP) pro-
vides often accurate approximations  but not bounds. We prove that for a class of
attractive binary models  the so–called Bethe approximation associated with any
ﬁxed point of loopy BP always lower bounds the true likelihood. Empirically 
this bound is much tighter than the naive mean ﬁeld bound  and requires no fur-
ther work than running BP. We establish these lower bounds using a loop series
expansion due to Chertkov and Chernyak  which we show can be derived as a
consequence of the tree reparameterization characterization of BP ﬁxed points.

1 Introduction
Graphical models are widely used in many areas  including statistical machine learning  computer
vision  bioinformatics  and communications. Such applications typically require computationally
efﬁcient methods for (approximately) solving various problems  including computing marginal dis-
tributions and likelihood functions. The variational framework provides a suite of candidate meth-
ods  including mean ﬁeld approximations [3  9]  the sum–product or belief propagation (BP) algo-
rithm [11  14]  Kikuchi and cluster variational methods [23]  and related convex relaxations [21].

The likelihood or partition function of an undirected graphical model is of fundamental interest in
many contexts  including parameter estimation  error bounds in hypothesis testing  and combina-
torial enumeration. In rough terms  particular variational methods can be understood as solving
optimization problems whose optima approximate the log partition function. For mean ﬁeld meth-
ods  this optimal value is desirably guaranteed to lower bound the true likelihood [9]. For other
methods  including the Bethe variational problem underlying loopy BP [23]  optima may either
over–estimate or under–estimate the truth. Although “convexiﬁed” relaxations of the Bethe problem
yield upper bounds [21]  to date the best known lower bounds on the partition function are based on
mean ﬁeld theory. Recent work has studied loop series expansions [2  4] of the partition function 
which generate better approximations but not  in general  bounds.

Several existing theoretical results show that loopy BP  and the corresponding Bethe approximation 
have desirable properties for graphical models with long cycles [15] or sufﬁciently weak depen-
dencies [6  7  12  19]. However  these results do not explain the excellent empirical performance
of BP in many graphs with short cycles  like the nearest–neighbor grids arising in spatial statistics
and low–level vision [3  18  22]. Such models often encode “smoothness” priors  and thus have
attractive interactions which encourage connected variables to share common values. The ﬁrst main
contribution of this paper is to demonstrate a family of attractive models for which the Bethe varia-
tional method always yields lower bounds on the true likelihood. Although we focus on models with
binary variables (but arbitrary order of interactions)  we suspect that some ideas are more generally
applicable. For such models  these lower bounds are easily computed from any ﬁxed point of loopy
BP  and empirically improve substantially on naive mean ﬁeld bounds.

Our second main contribution lies in the route used to establish the Bethe lower bounds. In partic-
ular  Sec. 3 uses the reparameterization characterization of BP ﬁxed points [20] to provide a simple
derivation for the loop series expansion of Chertkov and Chernyak [2]. The Bethe approximation
is the ﬁrst term in this representation of the true partition function. Sec. 4 then identiﬁes attrac-
tive models for which all terms in this expansion are positive  thus establishing the Bethe lower
bound. We conclude with empirical results demonstrating the accuracy of this bound  and discuss
implications for future analysis and applications of loopy BP.

2 Undirected Graphical Models
Given an undirected graph G = (V  E)  with edges (s  t) ∈ E connecting n vertices s ∈ V   a graph-
ical model associates each node with a random variable Xs taking values xs ∈ X . For pairwise
Markov random ﬁelds (MRFs) as in Fig. 1  the joint distribution of x := {xs | s ∈ V } is speciﬁed
via a normalized product of local compatibility functions:

p(x) =

1

Z(ψ) Ys∈V

ψs(xs) Y(s t)∈E

ψst(xs  xt)

(1)

The partition function Z(ψ) := Px∈X n Qs ψs(xs) Q(s t) ψst(xs  xt)  whose value depends on

the compatibilities ψ  is deﬁned so that p(x) is properly normalized. We also consider distributions
deﬁned by hypergraphs G = (V  C)  where each hyperedge c ∈ C connects some subset of the
vertices (c ⊂ V ). Letting xc := {xs | s ∈ c}  the corresponding joint distribution equals

p(x) =

1

Z(ψ) Ys∈V

ψs(xs) Yc∈C

ψc(xc)

(2)

where as before Z(ψ) = Px∈X n Qs ψs(xs) Qc ψc(xc). Such higher–order random ﬁelds are

conveniently described by the bipartite factor graphs [11] of Fig. 2.

In statistical physics  the partition function arises in the study of how physical systems respond to
changes in external stimuli or temperature [23]. Alternatively  when compatibility functions are
parameterized by exponential families [20]  log Z(ψ) is the family’s cumulant generating function 
and thus intrinsically related to the model’s marginal statistics. For directed Bayesian networks
(which can be factored as in eq. (2))  Z(ψ) is the marginal likelihood of observed data  and plays a
central role in learning and model selection [9]. However  for general graphs coupling discrete ran-
dom variables  the cost of exactly evaluating Z(ψ) grows exponentially with n [8]. Computationally
tractable families of bounds on the true partition function are thus of great practical interest.

2.1 Attractive Discrete Random Fields
In this paper  we focus on binary random vectors x ∈ {0  1}n. We say that a pairwise MRF  with
compatibility functions ψst : {0  1}2 → R+  has attractive interactions if

(3)
for each edge (s  t) ∈ E. Intuitively  this condition requires all potentials to place greater weight
on conﬁgurations where neighboring variables take the same value. Our later analysis is based on
pairwise marginal distributions τst(xs  xt)  which we parameterize as follows:

ψst(0  0) ψst(1  1) ≥ ψst(0  1) ψst(1  0)

τst(xs  xt) = (cid:20)1 − τs − τt + τst

τs − τst

τt − τst

τst (cid:21)

τs := Eτst [Xs]
τst := Eτst [XsXt]

(4)

We let Eτst [·] denote expectation with respect to τst(xs  xt)  so that τst is the probability that
Xs = Xt = 1. This normalized matrix is attractive  satisfying eq. (3)  if and only if τst ≥ τsτt.
For binary variables  the pairwise MRF of eq. (1) provides one representation of a general  inho-
mogeneous Ising model. In the statistical physics literature  Ising models are typically expressed
by coupling random spins zs ∈ {−1  +1} with symmetric potentials log ψst(zs  zt) = θstzszt. The
attractiveness condition of eq. (3) then becomes θst ≥ 0  and the resulting model has ferromagnetic
interactions. Furthermore  pairwise MRFs satisfy the regularity condition of [10]  and thus allow
tractable MAP estimation via graph cuts [5]  if and only if they are attractive. Even for attractive
models  however  calculation of the partition function in non–planar graphs is #P–complete [8].

To deﬁne families of higher–order attractive potentials  we ﬁrst consider a probability distribution
τc(xc) on k = |c| binary variables. Generalizing eq. (4)  we parameterize such distributions by the

2

following collection of 2k − 1 mean parameters:

τa := Eτc(cid:20)Ys∈a

Xs(cid:21)

∅ 6= a ⊆ c

(5)

For example  τstu(xs  xt  xu) would be parameterized by {τs  τt  τu  τst  τsu  τtu  τstu}. For any
subset a ⊆ c  we then deﬁne the following central moment statistic:

κa := Eτc(cid:20)Ys∈a

(Xs − τs)(cid:21)

∅ 6= a ⊆ c

(6)

Note that κs = 0  while κst = Covτ (Xs  Xt) = τst − τsτt. The third–order central moment then
equals the cumulant κstu = τstu − τstτu − τsuτt − τtuτs + 2τsτtτu.
Given these deﬁnitions  we say that a probability distribution τc(xc) is attractive if the central mo-
ments associated with all subsets a ⊆ c of binary variables are non–negative (κa ≥ 0). Similarly  a
compatibility function ψc(xc) is attractive if the probability distribution attained by normalizing its
values has non–negative central moments. For example  the following potential is easily shown to
satisfy this condition for all degrees k = |c|  and any scalar θc > 0:

log ψc(x1  . . .   xk) = (cid:26) θc

−θc

x1 = x2 = · · · = xk
otherwise

(7)

2.2 Belief Propagation and the Bethe Variational Principle
Many applications of graphical models require estimates of the posterior marginal distributions of
individual variables τs(xs) or factors τc(xc). Loopy belief propagation (BP) approximates these
marginals via a series of messages passed among nodes of the graphical model [14  23]. Let Γ(s)
denote the set of factors which depend on Xs  or equivalently the neighbors of node s in the corre-
sponding factor graph. The BP algorithm then iterates the following message updates:

¯msc(xs) ← ψs(xs) Yd∈Γ(s)\c

mds(xs)

mcs(xs) ← Xxc\s

ψc(xc) Yt∈c\s

¯mtc(xt)

(8)

The left–hand expression updates the message ¯msc(xs) passed from variable node s to factor c. New
outgoing messages mcs(xs) from factor c to each s ∈ c are then determined by marginalizing the
incoming messages from other nodes. At any iteration  appropriately normalized products of these
messages deﬁne estimates of the desired marginals:

τs(xs) ∝ ψs(xs) Yc∈Γ(s)

mcs(xs)

τc(xc) ∝ ψc(xc) Yt∈c

¯mtc(xt)

(9)

In tree–structured graphs  BP deﬁnes a dynamic programming recursion which converges to the
exact marginals after ﬁnitely many iterations [11  14]. In graphs with cycles  however  convergence
is not guaranteed  and pseudo–marginals computed via eq. (9) are (often good) approximations.

A wide range of inference algorithms can be derived via variational approximations [9] to the true
partition function. Loopy BP is implicitly associated with the following Bethe approximation:

log Zβ(ψ; τ ) = Xs∈V Xxs
− Xs∈V Xxs

τs(xs) log ψs(xs) + Xc∈CXxc
τs(xs) log τs(xs) − Xc∈CXxc

τc(xc) log ψc(xc)

τc(xc) log

Fixed points of loopy BP correspond to stationary points of this Bethe approximation [23]  subject

τc(xc) = τs(xs).

to the local marginalization constraints Pxc\s
3 Reparameterization and Loop Series Expansions
As discussed in Sec. 2.2  any BP ﬁxed point is in one–to–one correspondence with a set {τs  τc}
of pseudo–marginals associated with each of the graph’s nodes s ∈ V and factors c ∈ C. These
pseudo–marginals then lead to an alternative parameterization [20] of the factor graph of eq. (2):

p(x) =

1

Z(τ ) Ys∈V

τs(xs) Yc∈C

τc(xc)

Qt∈c τt(xt)

(11)

For pairwise MRFs  the reparameterized compatibility functions equal τst(xs  xt)/τs(xs)τt(xt).
The BP algorithm effectively searches for reparameterizations which are tree–consistent  so that

3

τc(xc) is the exact marginal distribution of Xc for any tree (or forest) embedded in the original
graph [20]. In later sections  we take expectations with respect to τc(xc) of functions f (xc) de-
ﬁned over individual factors. Although these pseudo–marginals will in general not equal the true
marginals pc(xc)  BP ﬁxed points ensure local consistency so that Eτc [f (Xc)] is well–deﬁned.
Using eq. (10)  it is easily shown that the Bethe approximation Zβ(τ ; τ ) = 1 for any joint distribu-
tion deﬁned by reparameterized potentials as in eq. (11). For simplicity  the remainder of this paper
focuses on reparameterized models of this form  and analyzes properties of the corresponding exact
partition function Z(τ ). The resulting expansions and bounds are then related to the original MRF’s
partition function via the positive constant Z(ψ)/Z(τ ) = Zβ(ψ; τ ) of eq. (10).
Recently  Chertkov and Chernyak proposed a ﬁnite loop series expansion [2] of the partition func-
tion  whose ﬁrst term coincides with the Bethe approximation. They provide two derivations: one
applies a trigonometric identity to Fourier representations of binary variables  while the second em-
ploys a saddle point approximation obtained via an auxiliary ﬁeld of complex variables. The gauge
transformations underlying these derivations are a type of reparameterization  but their form is com-
plicated by auxiliary variables and extraneous degrees of freedom. In this section  we show that the
ﬁxed point characterization of eq. (11) leads to a more direct  and arguably simpler  derivation.

3.1 Pairwise Loop Series Expansions
We begin by developing a loop series expansion for pairwise MRFs. Given an undirected graph
G = (V  E)  and some subset F ⊆ E of the graph’s edges  let ds(F ) denote the degree (number of
neighbors) of node s in the subgraph induced by F . As illustrated in Fig. 1  any subset F for which
all nodes s ∈ V have degree ds(F ) 6= 1 deﬁnes a generalized loop [2]. The partition function for
any binary  pairwise MRF can then be expanded via an associated set of loop corrections.
Proposition 1. Consider a pairwise MRF deﬁned on an undirected G = (V  E)  with reparameter-
ized potentials as in eq. (11). The associated partition function then equals

Z(τ ) = 1 + X∅6=F ⊆E

βF Ys∈V

Eτsh(Xs − τs)ds(F )i

βF := Y(s t)∈F

βst

βst :=

τst − τsτt

τs(1 − τs)τt(1 − τt)

=

Covτst (Xs  Xt)

Varτs (Xs) Varτt (Xt)

where only generalized loops F lead to non–zero terms in the sum of eq. (12)  and

are central moments of the binary variables at individual nodes.

Eτs(cid:2)(Xs − τs)d(cid:3) = τs(1 − τs)(cid:2)(1 − τs)d−1 + (−1)d (τs)d−1(cid:3)

(12)

(13)

(14)

Proof. To establish the expansion of eq. (12)  we exploit the following polynomial representation of
reparameterized pairwise compatibility functions:

τst(xs  xt)
τs(xs)τt(xt)

= 1 + βst(xs − τs)(xt − τt)

(15)

As veriﬁed in [17]  this expression is satisﬁed for any (xs  xt) ∈ {0  1}2 if βst is deﬁned as in
eq. (13). For attractive models satisfying eq. (3)  βst ≥ 0 for all edges. Using E˜τ [·] to denote

expectation with respect to the fully factorized distribution ˜τ (x) = Qs τs(xs)  we then have

Z(τ ) = Xx∈{0 1}n Ys∈V
= E˜τ(cid:20) Y(s t)∈E

τst(xs  xt)
τs(xs)τt(xt)

τs(xs) Y(s t)∈E
τs(Xs)τt(Xt)(cid:21) = E˜τ(cid:20) Y(s t)∈E

τst(Xs  Xt)

1 + βst(Xs − τs)(Xt − τt)(cid:21)

(16)

Expanding this polynomial via the expectation operator’s linearity  we recover one term for each
non–empty subset F ⊆ E of the graph’s edges:

Z(τ ) = 1 + X∅6=F ⊆E

E˜τ(cid:20) Y(s t)∈F

βst(Xs − τs)(Xt − τt)(cid:21)

(17)

The expression in eq. (12) then follows from the independence structure of ˜τ (x)  and standard
formulas for the moments of Bernoulli random variables. To evaluate these terms  note that if
ds(F ) = 1  it follows that Eτs [Xs − τs] = 0. There is thus one loop correction for each generalized
loop F   in which all connected nodes have degree at least two.

Figure 1: A pairwise MRF coupling ten binary variables (left)  and the nine generalized loops in its loop series
expansion (right). For attractive potentials  two of the generalized loops may have negative signs (second &
third from right)  while the core graph of Thm. 1 contains eight variables (far right).

Figure 1 illustrates the set of generalized loops associated with a particular pairwise MRF. These
loops effectively deﬁne corrections to the Bethe estimate Z(τ ) ≈ 1 of the partition function for
reparameterized models. Tree–structured graphs do not contain any non–trivial generalized loops 
and the Bethe variational approximation is thus exact.

The loop expansion formulas of [2] can be precisely recovered by transforming binary variables to
a spin representation  and refactoring terms from the denominator of edge weights βst to adjacent
vertices. Explicit computation of these loop corrections is in general intractable; for example  fully
connected graphs with n ≥ 5 nodes have more than 2n generalized loops. In some cases  accounting
for a small set of signiﬁcant loop corrections may lead to improved approximations to Z(ψ) [4]  or
more accurate belief estimates for LDPC codes [1]. We instead use the series expansion of Prop. 1
to establish analytic properties of BP ﬁxed points.

3.2 Factor Graph Loop Series Expansions
We now extend the loop series expansion to higher–order MRFs deﬁned on hypergraphs G = (V  C).
Let E = {(s  c) | c ∈ C  s ∈ c} denote the set of edges in the factor graph representation of this
MRF. As illustrated in Fig. 2  we deﬁne a generalized loop to be a subset F ⊆ E of edges such that
all connected factor and variable nodes have degree at least two.
Proposition 2. Consider any factor graph G = (V  C) with reparameterized potentials as in
eq. (11)  and associated edges E. The partition function then equals

Z(τ ) = 1 + X∅6=F ⊆E

βF Ys∈V

βa :=

κa

Qt∈a τt(1 − τt)

βF :=Yc∈C

βac(F )

(18)

(19)

where ac(F ) := {s ∈ c | (s  c) ∈ F } denotes the subset of variables linked to factor node c by the
edges in F . Only generalized loops F lead to non–zero terms in the sum of eq. (18).
Proof. As before  we employ a polynomial representation of the reparameterized factors in eq. (11):

τc(xc)

Qt∈c τt(xt)

= 1 + Xa⊆c |a|≥2

βa Ys∈a

(xs − τs)

(20)

For factor graphs with attractive reparameterized potentials  the constant βa ≥ 0 for all a ⊆ c.
Note that this representation  which is derived in [17]  reduces to that of eq. (15) when c = {s  t}.
Single–variable subsets are excluded in eq. (20) because κs = Eτs [Xs − τs] = 0.
Applying eq. (20) as in our earlier derivation for pairwise MRFs (see eq. (16))  we may express the
partition function of the reparameterized factor graph as follows:

Z(τ ) = E˜τ(cid:20) Yc∈C

τc(Xc)

Qt∈c τt(Xt)(cid:21) = E˜τ(cid:20) Yc∈C

1 + X∅6=a⊆c

βa Ys∈a

(Xs − τs)(cid:21)

(21)

Note that βa = 0 for any subset where |a| = 1. There is then a one–to–one correspondence between
variable node subsets a ⊆ c  and subsets {(s  c) | s ∈ a} of the factor graph’s edges E. Expanding
this expression by F ⊆ E  it follows that each factor c ∈ C contributes a term corresponding to the
chosen subset ac(F ) of its edges:

Z(τ ) = 1 + X∅6=F ⊆E

E˜τ(cid:20) Yc∈C

βac(F ) Ys∈ac(F )

(Xs − τs)(cid:21)

(22)

Note that β∅ = 1. Equation (18) then follows from the independence properties of ˜τ (x). For a term
in this loop series to be non–zero  there must be no degree one variables  since Eτs[Xs − τs] = 0.
In addition  the deﬁnition of βa implies that there can be no degree one factor nodes.

4 Lower Bounds in Attractive Binary Models
The Bethe approximation underlying loopy BP differs from mean ﬁeld methods [9]  which lower
bound the true log partition function Z(ψ)  in two key ways. First  while the Bethe entropy (second
line of eq. (10)) is exact for tree–structured graphs  it approximates (rather than bounds) the true
entropy in graphs with cycles. Second  the marginalization condition imposed by loopy BP relaxes
(rather than strengthens) the global constraints characterizing valid distributions [21]. Neverthe-
less  we now show that for a large family of attractive graphical models  the Bethe approximation
Zβ(ψ; τ ) of eq. (10) lower bounds Z(ψ). In contrast with mean ﬁeld methods  these bounds hold
only at appropriate BP ﬁxed points  not for arbitrarily chosen pseudo–marginals τc(xc).

4.1 Partition Function Bounds for Pairwise Graphical Models
Consider a pairwise MRF deﬁned on G = (V  E)  as in eq. (1). Let VH ⊆ V denote the set of
nodes which either belong to some cycle in G  or lie on a path (sequence of edges) connecting two
cycles. We then deﬁne the core graph H = (VH   EH ) as the node–induced subgraph obtained by
discarding edges from nodes outside VH  so that EH = {(s  t) ∈ E | s  t ∈ VH }. The unique core
graph H underlying any graph G can be efﬁciently constructed by iteratively pruning degree one
nodes  or leaves  until all remaining nodes have two or more neighbors. The following theorem
identiﬁes conditions under which all terms in the loop series expansion must be non–negative.
Theorem 1. Let H = (VH   EH ) be the core graph for a pairwise binary MRF  with attractive
potentials satisfying eq. (3). Consider any BP ﬁxed point for which all nodes s ∈ VH with three or
more neighbors in H have marginals τs ≤ 1
2 ). The corresponding Bethe
variational approximation Zβ(ψ; τ ) then lower bounds the true partition function Z(ψ).

2 (or equivalently  τs ≥ 1

Proof. It is sufﬁcient to show that Z(τ ) ≥ 1 for any reparameterized pairwise MRF  as in eq. (11).
From eq. (9)  note that loopy BP estimates the pseudo–marginal τst(xs  xt) via the product of
ψst(xs  xt) with message functions of single variables. For this reason  attractive pairwise com-
patibilities always lead to BP ﬁxed points with attractive pseudo–marginals satisfying τst ≥ τsτt.
Consider the pairwise loop series expansion of eq. (12). As shown by eq. (13)  attractive models

each generalized loop F ⊆ E. Suppose ﬁrst that the graph has a single cycle  and thus exactly one
non–zero generalized loop F . Because all connected nodes in this cycle have degree two  the bound

lead to edge weights βst ≥ 0. It is thus sufﬁcient to show that Qs
Eτs(cid:2)(Xs − τs)ds(F )(cid:3) ≥ 0 for
follows because Eτs(cid:2)(Xs − τs)2(cid:3) ≥ 0. More generally  we clearly have Z(τ ) ≥ 1 in graphs where

every generalized loop F associates an even number of neighbors ds(F ) with each node.
Focusing on generalized loops containing nodes with odd degree d ≥ 3  eq. (14) implies that

Eτs(cid:2)(Xs − τs)d(cid:3) ≥ 0 for marginals satisfying 1 − τs ≥ τs. For BP ﬁxed points in which τs ≤ 1
for all nodes  we thus have Z(τ ) ≥ 1. In particular  the symmetric ﬁxed point τs = 1
2 leads to uni-
formly positive generalized loop corrections. More generally  the marginals of nodes s for which
ds(F ) ≤ 2 for every generalized loop F do not inﬂuence the expansion’s positivity. Theorem 1
discards these nodes by examining the topology of the core graph H (see Fig. 1 for an example).
For ﬁxed points where τs ≥ 1
2 for all nodes  we rewrite the polynomial in the loop expansion of
eq. (15) as (1 + βst(τs − xs)(τt − xt))  and employ an analogous line of reasoning.
In addition to establishing Thm. 1  our arguments show that the true partition function monotonically
increases as additional edges  with attractive reparameterized potentials as in eq. (11)  are added to
a graph with ﬁxed pseudo–marginals τs ≤ 1
2 . For such models  the accumulation of particular
loop corrections  as explored by [4]  produces a sequence of increasingly tight bounds on Z(ψ). In
addition  we note that the conditions required by Thm. 1 are similar to those underlying classical

Sherman (GKS) inequality leads to an alternative proof in cases where τs = 1

Indeed  the Grifﬁths–Kelly–

2 for all nodes.

For attractive Ising models in which some nodes have marginals τs > 1
2   the loop
series expansion may contain negative terms. For small graphs like that in Fig. 1  it is possible to
use upper bounds on the edge weights βst  which follow from τst ≤ min(τs  τt)  to cancel negative
loop corrections with larger positive terms. As conﬁrmed by the empirical results in Sec. 4.3  the
lower bound Z(ψ) ≥ Zβ(ψ; τ ) thus continues to hold for many (perhaps all) attractive Ising models
with less homogeneous marginal biases.

4.2 Partition Function Bounds for Factor Graphs
Given a factor graph G = (V  C) relating binary variables  deﬁne a core graph H = (VH   CH ) by
excluding variable and factor nodes which are not members of any generalized loops. As in Sec. 2.2 
let Γ(s) denote the set of factor nodes neighboring variable node s in the core graph H.
Theorem 2. Let H = (VH   CH ) be the core graph for a binary factor graph  and consider an
attractive BP ﬁxed point for which one of the following conditions holds:

(i) τs ≤ 1
(ii) τs ≥ 1

2 for all nodes s ∈ VH with |Γ(s)| ≥ 3  and κa ≥ 0 for all a ⊆ c  c ∈ CH.
2 for all nodes s ∈ VH with |Γ(s)| ≥ 3  and (−1)|a|κa ≥ 0 for all a ⊆ c  c ∈ CH.

The Bethe approximation Zβ(ψ; τ ) then lower bounds the true partition function Z(ψ).

For the case where τs ≤ 1
arguments in Sec. 4.1. When τs ≥ 1
of eq. (20)  and again recover uniformly positive loop corrections.

2   the proof of this theorem is a straightforward generalization of the
2   we replace all (xs − τs) terms by (τs − xs) in the expansion

For any given BP ﬁxed point  the conditions of Thm. 2 are easy to verify. For factor graphs  it is
more challenging to determine which compatibility functions ψc(xc) necessarily lead to attractive
ﬁxed points. For symmetric potentials as in eq. (7)  however  one can show that the conditions on
κa  a ⊆ c are necessarily satisﬁed whenever all variable nodes s ∈ VH have the same bias.

4.3 Empirical Comparison of Mean Field and Bethe Lower Bounds
In this section  we compare the accuracy of the Bethe variational bounds established by Thm. 1
to those produced by a naive  fully factored mean ﬁeld approximation [3  9]. Using the
spin representation zs ∈ {−1  +1}  we examine Ising models with attractive pairwise potentials
log ψst(zs  zt) = θstzszt of varying strengths θst ≥ 0. We ﬁrst examine a 2D torus  with potentials
of uniform strength θst = ¯θ and no local observations. For such MRFs  the exact partition func-
tion may be computed via Onsager’s classical eigenvector method [13]. As shown in Fig. 3(a)  for
moderate ¯θ the Bethe bound Zβ(ψ; τ ) is substantially tighter than mean ﬁeld. For large ¯θ  only two
states (all spins “up” or “down”) have signiﬁcant probability  so that Z(ψ) ≈ 2 exp(¯θ|E|). In this
regime  loopy BP exhibits “symmetry breaking” [6]  and converges to one of these states at random
with corresponding bound Zβ(ψ; τ ) ≈ exp(¯θ|E|). As veriﬁed in Fig. 3(a)  as ¯θ → ∞ the difference
log Z(ψ) − log Zβ(ψ; τ ) ≈ log 2 ≈ 0.69 thus remains bounded.
We also consider a set of random 10 × 10 nearest–neighbor grids  with inhomogeneous pairwise

potentials sampled according to |θst| ∼ N(cid:0)0  ¯θ 2(cid:1)  and observation potentials log ψs(zs) = θszs 
|θs| ∼ N(cid:0)0  0.12(cid:1). For each candidate ¯θ  we sample 100 random MRFs  and plot the average differ-

ence log Zβ(ψ; τ ) − log Z(ψ) between the true partition function and the BP (or mean ﬁeld) ﬁxed
point reached from a random initialization. Fig. 3(b) ﬁrst considers MRFs where θs > 0 for all
nodes  so that the conditions of Thm. 1 are satisﬁed for all BP ﬁxed points. For these models  the
Bethe bound is extremely accurate.
In Fig. 3(c)  we also consider MRFs where the observation
potentials θs are of mixed signs. Although this sometimes leads to BP ﬁxed points with negative
associated loop corrections  the Bethe variational approximation nevertheless always lower bounds
the true partition function in these examples. We hypothesize that this bound in fact holds for all
attractive  binary pairwise MRFs  regardless of the observation potentials.
5 Discussion
We have provided an alternative  direct derivation of the partition function’s loop series expansion 
based on the reparameterization characterization of BP ﬁxed points. We use this expansion to prove
that the Bethe approximation lower bounds the true partition function in a family of binary attractive

parameter estimation [3]  as well as its convergence dynamics. We are currently exploring general-
izations of our results to other families of attractive  or “nearly” attractive  graphical models.
