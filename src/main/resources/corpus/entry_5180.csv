Abstract

When stimulated with complex action potential sequences synapses exhibit spike
timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with modulated pre- and postsynaptic contri-
butions to long-term synaptic modiﬁcations. In order to investigate the functional
consequences of these contribution dynamics (CD) we propose a minimal model
formulated in terms of differential equations. We ﬁnd that our model reproduces
data from to recent experimental studies with a small number of biophysically in-
terpretable parameters. The model allows to investigate the susceptibility of STDP
to arbitrary time courses of pre- and postsynaptic activities  i.e. its nonlinear ﬁlter
properties. We demonstrate this for the simple example of small periodic mod-
ulations of pre- and postsynaptic ﬁring rates for which our model can be solved.
It predicts synaptic strengthening for synchronous rate modulations. Modiﬁca-
tions are dominant in the theta frequency range  a result which underlines the
well known relevance of theta activities in hippocampus and cortex for learning.
We also ﬁnd emphasis of speciﬁc baseline spike rates and suppression for high
background rates. The latter suggests a mechanism of network activity regulation
inherent in STDP. Furthermore  our novel formulation provides a general frame-
work for investigating the joint dynamics of neuronal activity and the CD of STDP
in both spike-based as well as rate-based neuronal network models.

Introduction

During the past decade the effects of exact spike timing on the change of synaptic connectivity have
been studied extensively. In vitro studies have shown that the induction of long-term potentiation
(LTP) requires the presynaptic input to a cell to precede the postsynaptic output and vice versa
for long-term depression (LTD) (see [1  2  3]). This phenomenon has been termed spike timing-
dependent plasticity (STDP) and emphasizes the importance of a causal order in neuronal signaling.
Thereby it extends pure Hebbian learning  which requires only the coincidence of pre- and postsy-
naptic activity. Consequently  experiments have shown an asymmetric exponential dependence on
the timing of spike pairs and a molecular mechanism mostly dependent on the inﬂux of Ca2+ (see
[4  5] for reviews). Further  when induced with more complex spike trains  synaptic modiﬁcation
shows nonlinearities ([6  7  8]) indicating the inﬂuence of short-term plasticity.
Theoretical approaches to STDP cover studies using the asymmetric pair-based STDP window as
a lookup table  more biophysical models based on synaptic and neuronal variables  and sophisti-
cated kinetic models (for a review see [9]). Recently  the experimentally observed inﬂuence of the
postsynaptic membrane potential (e.g. [10]) has also been taken into account ([11]).
Our approach is based on differential Hebbian learning ([12  13])  which generates asymmetric
timing windows similar to STDP ([14]) depending on the shape of the back-propagating action

potential ([15]). We extend it with a mechanism for activating learning by an increase in postsynaptic
activity  because both the induction of LTP and LTD require [Ca2+] to exceed a threshold ([16]).
Moreover  we include a mechanism for adaptive suppression on both synaptic sides  similar to the
model in [7]. Finally  we for simplicity assume that both the presynaptic and the postsynaptic
side function as low-pass ﬁlters; a spike leaves a fast increasing and exponentially decaying trace.
Together  we propose a set of differential equations  which captures the contribution dynamics (CD)
of pre- and postsynaptic activities to STDP  thereby describing synaptic plasticity as a ﬁlter.
Our framework reproduces experimental ﬁndings from two recent in vitro studies in the visual cor-
tex and the hippocampus in most details. Furthermore  it proves to be particularly suitable for the
analysis of the susceptibility of STDP to pre- and postsynaptic rate modulations. This is demon-
strated by an analysis of synaptic changes depending on oscillatory modulations of baseline ﬁring
rates.

2 Formulation of the model

We use a variant of the classical differential Hebbian learning assuming a change of synaptic con-
nectivity w  which is dependent on the presynaptic activity trace ypre and the temporal derivative of
the postsynaptic activity trace ypost:

(1)
cw denotes a constant learning rate. An illustration of this learning rule for pairs of spikes is given
in Figure 1B. For simplicity  we assume these activity traces to be abstract low-pass ﬁltered versions
of neuronal activity x in the presynaptic and postsynaptic cells  e.g. the concentration of Ca2+ or
the amount of bound glutamate:

˙w(t) = cw ypre(t) ˙ypost(t) .

˙ypre(t) = upre(t) · xpre(t) −

ypre(t)

τpre

˙ypost(t) = upost(t)z(t) · xpost(t) −

ypost(t)

τpost

.

(2)

(3)

The dynamics of the y’s are characterized by their respective time constants τpre and τpost. The
contribution of each spike is regulated by a suppressing attenuation factor u pre- and postsynapti-
cally. On the postsynaptical side an additional activation factor z ”enables” the synapse to learn.
The dynamics of u and z are discussed below. x represents neuronal activity which can be either a
time-continuous ﬁring rate or spike trains given by series of δ pulses

xpre  post(t) =(cid:88)i

δ(t − ti

(4)

which allows analytical investigations of the properties of our model. Note that formally x(t) has
then to be taken as x(t + 0). An illustrating overview over the different parts of the model with
sample trajectories is shown in Figure 1A.
We deﬁne the relative change of synaptic connectivity after after a period T from Equation (1) as

∆w =

w(t0 + T )

w(t0) − 1 =

cw

w(t0)(cid:90)T

ypre ˙ypost dt .

(5)

The dependence on the initial synaptic strength w(t0) as observed in [3  8] shall not be discussed
here  but can easily be achieved by making the learning rate cw in Equation (1) w-dependent. Here 
w(t0) is chosen to be 1.
Ignoring attenuation and activation  a single pair of spikes at temporal distance ∆t analytically yields
the typical STDP window (see Figure 2A and 3A):

∆w(∆t) =(cid:40)cw(cid:16)1 − τpre

due to the initially positive postsynaptic contribution ( ˙ypost  solid line)  which is always stronger
than the following negative part. Right: for the reverse timing the positive presynaptic contribution
is only multiplied with the negative postsynaptic trace (right). Areas contributing to learning are
shaded.

The importance of adaptive suppressing mechanisms for synaptic plasticity has experimentally been
shown by Froemke and colleagues ([7  6]). Therefore  we down-regulate the contribution of the
spikes to the activity traces y in Equation (2) and (3) with an attenuation factor u on both pre- and
postsynaptic sides:

This should be understood as an abstract representation of for instance the depletion of transmitters
in the presynaptic bouton ([17]) or the frequency-dependent spike attenuation in dendritic spines
([18])  respectively. These recover with their time constants τ rec and are bound between u0 and 1.

which enhances the contribution of a postsynaptic spike to the postsynaptic trace  e.g. by the removal
of the Mg2+ block from postsynaptic NMDA receptors ([19  5]). The nonlinear positive feedback
is introduced to describe strong enhancing effects as for instance autocatalytic mechanisms  which
have been suggested to play a role in learning on several time-scales ([20  21]). The activation
z decays hyperbolically to a lower bound z0 and the contribution of a spike is weighted with the
constant cact.

3 Comparison to experiments

In order to evaluate our model we implemented experimental stimulation protocols from in vitro
studies on synapses of the visual cortex ([7]) and the hippocampus ([8]) of rats. In both studies 
simple pairs of spikes and more complex spike trains were artiﬁcially elicited in the presynaptic and
the postsynaptic cell and the induced change of synaptic connectivity was recorded.
Froemke and colleagues ([7]) focused on the effects of spike bursts on synaptic modiﬁcation in the
visual cortex. In addition to the classical STDP pairing protocol – a presynaptic spike preceding
or following a postsynaptic spike after a speciﬁc time ∆t – four other experimental protocols (see
Figure 2B to E) were performed: (1) 5-5 bursts with ﬁve spikes of a certain frequency on both
synaptic sides  where the postsynaptic side follows the presynaptic side  (2) presynaptic 100 Hz
bursts with n spikes following one postsynaptic spike (post-n-pre)  (3) presynaptic 100 Hz bursts
with different numbers of spikes followed by one postsynaptic spike (n-pre-post) and (4) a post-pre
pair with varying number of following postsynaptic spikes (post-pre-n-post).

In the hippocampal study of Wang et al. ([8]) synaptic modiﬁcation induced by triplets (pre-post-pre
and post-pre-post) and quadruplets (pre-post-post-pre and post-pre-pre-post) of spikes was measured
while the respective interspike intervals were varied. (see Figure 3B to D).
As a ﬁrst step we took the time constants from the experimentally measured pair-based STDP win-
dows as our low-pass ﬁlter time constants (see Equation 6). They remained constant for each data
set: (1) τpre = 13.5 ms and τpost = 42.8 ms for [7]  (2) τpre = 16.8 ms and τpost = 33.7 ms for [8]
(taken from [23] since not present in the study). Next  we chose the learning rate cw in Equation (6)
to ﬁt the synaptic change for the pairing protocol: (1) cw = 1.56 for the visual cortex data  (2)
cw = 0.99 for the hippocampal data set. The remaining parameters were estimated manually within
biologically plausible ranges and are shown in Table 1. The model was then applied to the more
complex stimulation protocols by solving the differential equations semi-analytically  i.e. separately
for every spike and the following interspike interval. As measure for the prediction error of our
model we used the normalized mean-square error E

4 Phase  frequency and baseline rate dependence of STDP with contribution

dynamics

As shown in the previous section our model can reproduce the experimental ﬁndings of synaptic
weight changes in response to spike sequences surprisingly well and yields better ﬁts than former
studies (e.g. [22]). The proposed framework  however  is not restricted to spike sequences but al-
lows to investigate synaptic changes depending on arbitrary pre- and postsynaptic activities. For
instance it could be used for investigations of the plasticity effects in simulations with inhomoge-
neous Poisson processes. Taking x(t) to be ﬁring rates of Poissonian spike trains our account of
STDP represents a useful approximation for the expected changes of synaptic strength depending
on the time courses of xpre and xpost (compare e.g. [24]). Therefore our model can serve also as
building block in rate based network models for investigation of the joint dynamics of neuronal
activities and synaptic weights.
Here  we demonstrate the beneﬁt of our approach for determining the ﬁlter properties of STDP
subject to CD  i.e. we use the equations together with the parameters from the experiments for
determining the dependency of weight changes on frequency  relative phase ∆φ and baseline rates
of modulated pre- and postsynaptic ﬁring rates. While for substantial modulations of ﬁring rates
the nonlinearities are difﬁcult to be treated analytically  for small periodical modulations around a
baseline rate x0 the corresponding synaptic changes can be calculated analytically. This is done by
considering

xpre(t) = x0 + ε cos(2πf t)

(11)
which for small ε < x0 allows linearization of all equations from which one obtains ∆W =
∆w/(T εpreεpost)  where T = 1/f = 2π/ω is the period of the respective oscillations. Neglect-

and xpost(t) = x0 + ε cos(2πf t − ∆φ)

The analytical results for the case with CD are shown graphically in Figure 4 using the parameters
from cortex and hippocampus  respectively (see Tab. 1). These plots contain the main ﬁndings:
(1) rate modulations in the theta frequency range ((cid:39) 7Hz) lead to strongest synaptic changes  (2)
also for phase-zero synchronous rate modulations weight changes are positive  (3) in hippocampus
maximal weight change magnitudes occur at baseline rates around 5 Hz  and (4) for high baseline
0 for the visual
rates weight changes become suppressed (∼ 1/x0 for the hippocampus  ∼ 1/x2
cortex). Numerical simulations with ﬁnite rate modulations were found to conﬁrm these analytical
predictions surprisingly well. Also for the nonlinear regime and Poissionian spike trains deviations
remained moderate.

5 Discussion

STDP has been proposed to represent a fundamental mechanism underlying learning and many
models explored its computational role (examples are [25  26  27]). In contrast  research targeting
the computational roles of dynamical phenomena inherent in STDP are in the beginning (see [9]).
Here  we here formulated a minimal  yet biologically plausible model including the dynamics of how
neuronal activity contributes to STDP. We found that our model reproduces the synaptic changes in
response to spike sequences in experiments in cortex and hippocampus with high accuracy.
Using the corresponding parameters our model predicts weight changes depending on temporal
structures in the pre- and postsynaptic activities including spike sequences and varying ﬁring rates.
When applied to pre- and postsynaptic rate modulations our approach quantiﬁes synaptic changes
depending on frequency and phase shifts between pre- and postsynaptic activities. A rigorous per-
turbation analysis of our model reveals that the dynamical ﬁlter properties of STDP make weight
changes sensitively dependent on combinations of speciﬁc features of pre- and postsynaptic signals.
In particular  our analysis indicates that both cortical as well as hippocampal STDP is most suscep-
tible for modulations in the theta frequency range. It predicts the dependency of synaptic changes
on pre- and postsynaptic phase relations of rate modulations. These results are in line with experi-
mental results on the relation of theta rhythms and learning. For instance in hippocampus it is well
established that theta oscillations are relevant for learning (for a recent paper see [28]). Furthermore 
spike activities in hippocampus exhibit speciﬁc phase relations with the theta rhythm (for a review
see [29]). Also  it has been found that during learning cortex and hippocampus tend to synchronize
with particular phase relations that depend on the novelty of the item to be learned ([30]). The results
presented here underline these ﬁndings and make testable predictions for the corresponding synaptic
changes.
Also  we ﬁnd potentiation for zero phase differences and strong attenuation of weight changes at
large baseline rates which is particularly strong for cortical synapses. This ﬁnding suggests a mech-
anism for restricting weight changes with high activity levels and that STDP is de facto switched off
when large ﬁring rates are required for the execution of a function as opposed to learning phases;
during the latter baseline rates should be rather low  which is particularly relevant in cortex. While
for cortical synapses our analysis predicts that very low baseline activities are contributing most to
weight changes  in hippocampus synaptic modiﬁcations peak at baseline ﬁring rates x0 around 5 Hz 
which suggests that x0 can control learning.
Our study suggests that the ﬁlter properties of STDP originating from the dynamics of pre- and
postsynaptic activity contributions are in fact exploited for learning in the brain. In particular  shifts
in baseline rates  as well as the frequency and the respective phases of pre- and postsynaptic rate
modulations induced by theta oscillations could be tuned to match the values that make STDP most
susceptible for synaptic modiﬁcations. A fascinating possibility thereby is that these features could
be used to control the learning rate which would represent a novel mechanism in addition to other
control signals as e.g. neuromodulators.
