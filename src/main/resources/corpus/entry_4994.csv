Abstract

Across a wide range of cognitive tasks  recent experience inﬂuences behavior. For
example  when individuals repeatedly perform a simple two-alternative forced-
choice task (2AFC)  response latencies vary dramatically based on the immedi-
ately preceding trial sequence. These sequential effects have been interpreted
as adaptation to the statistical structure of an uncertain  changing environment
(e.g.  Jones and Sieck  2003; Mozer  Kinoshita  and Shettel  2007; Yu and Co-
hen  2008). The Dynamic Belief Model (DBM) (Yu and Cohen  2008) explains
sequential effects in 2AFC tasks as a rational consequence of a dynamic internal
representation that tracks second-order statistics of the trial sequence (repetition
rates) and predicts whether the upcoming trial will be a repetition or an alterna-
tion of the previous trial. Experimental results suggest that ﬁrst-order statistics
(base rates) also inﬂuence sequential effects. We propose a model that learns both
ﬁrst- and second-order sequence properties  each according to the basic princi-
ples of the DBM but under a uniﬁed inferential framework. This model  the Dy-
namic Belief Mixture Model (DBM2)  obtains precise  parsimonious ﬁts to data.
Furthermore  the model predicts dissociations in behavioral (Maloney  Martello 
Sahm  and Spillmann  2005) and electrophysiological studies (Jentzsch and Som-
mer  2002)  supporting the psychological and neurobiological reality of its two
components.

Introduction

Picture an intense match point at the Wimbledon tennis championship  Nadal on the defense from
Federer’s powerful shots. Nadal returns three straight hits to his forehand side. In the split second
before the ball is back in his court  he forms an expectation about where Federer will hit the ball
next—will the streak of forehands continue or will there be a switch to his backhand. As the point
continues  Nadal gains the upper ground and begins making Federer alternate from forehand to
backhand to forehand. Now Federer ﬁnds himself trying to predict whether or not this alternating
pattern will be continued with the next shot. These two are caught up in a high-stakes game of
sequential effects—their actions and expectations for the current shot have a strong dependence on
the past few shots. Sequential effects play a ubiquitous role in our lives—our actions are constantly
affected by our recent experiences.
In controlled environments  sequential effects have been observed across a wide range of tasks and
experimental paradigms  and aspects of cognition ranging from perception to memory to language
to decision making. Sequential effects often occur without awareness and cannot be overriden by
instructions  suggesting a robust cognitive inclination to adapt behavior in an ongoing manner. Sur-
prisingly  people exhibit sequential effects even when they are aware that there is no dependence

structure to the environment. Progress toward understanding the intricate complexities of sequential
effects will no doubt provide important insights into the ways in which individuals adapt to their
environment and make predictions about future outcomes.
One classic domain where reliable sequential effects have been observed is in two-alternative forced-
choice (2AFC) tasks (e.g  Jentzsch and Sommer  2002; Hale  1967; Soetens et al.  1985; Cho et al. 
2002). In this type of task  participants are shown one of two different stimuli  which we denote
as X and Y  and are instructed to respond as quickly as possible by mapping the stimulus to a
corresponding response  say pressing the left button for X and the right button for Y. Response time
(RT) is recorded  and the task is repeated several hundred or thousand times. To measure sequential
effects  the RT is conditioned on the recent trial history. (In 2AFC tasks  stimuli and responses are
confounded; as a result  it is common to refer to the ’trial’ instead of the ’stimulus’ or ’response’. In
this paper  ’trial’ will be synonymous with the stimulus-response pair.) Consider a sequence such
as XY Y XX  where the rightmost symbol is the current trial (X)  and the symbols to the left are
successively earlier trials. Such a four-back trial history can be represented in a manner that focuses
not on the trial identities  but on whether trials are repeated or alternated. With R and A denoting
repetitions and alternations  respectively  the trial sequence XY Y XX can be encoded as ARAR.
Note that this R/A encoding collapses across isomorphic sequences XY Y XX and Y XXY Y .
The small blue circles in Figure 1a show the RTs from Cho et al. (2002) conditioned on the recent
trial history. Along the abscissa in Figure 1a are all four-back sequence histories ordered according
to the R/A encoding. The left half of the graph represents cases where the current trial is a repetition
of the previous  and the right half represents cases where the current trial is an alternation. The
general pattern we see in the data is a triangular shape that can be understood by comparing the
two extreme points on each half  RRRR vs. AAAR and RRRA vs. AAAA. It seems logical that
the response to the current trial in RRRR will be signiﬁcantly faster than in AAAR (RTRRRR <
RTAAAR) because in the RRRR case  the current trial matches the expectation built up over the past
few trials whereas in the AAAR case  the current trial violates the expectation of an alternation. The
same argument applies to RRRA vs. AAAA  leading to the intuition that RTRRRA > RTAAAA.
The trial histories are ordered along the abscissa so that the left half is monotonically increasing
and the right half is monotonically decreasing following the same line of intuition  i.e.  many recent
repetitions to many recent alternations.

2 Toward A Rational Model Of Sequential Effects

Many models have been proposed to capture sequential effects  including Estes (1950)  Anderson
(1960)  Laming (1969)  and Cho et al. (2002). Other models have interpreted sequential effects as
adaptation to the statistical structure of a dynamic environment (e.g.  Jones and Sieck  2003; Mozer 
Kinoshita  and Shettel  2007). In this same vein  Yu and Cohen (2008) recently suggested a rational

explanation for sequential effects such as those observed in Cho et al. (2002). According to their
Dynamic Belief Model (DBM)  individuals estimate the statistics of a nonstationary environment.
The key contribution of this work is that it provides a rational justiﬁcation for sequential effects that
have been previously viewed as resulting from low-level brain mechanisms such as residual neural
activation.
DBM describes performance in 2AFC tasks as Bayesian inference over whether the next trial in the
sequence will be a repetition or an alternation of the previous trial  conditioned on the trial history. If
Rt is the Bernoulli random variable that denotes whether trial t is a repetition (Rt = 1) or alternation
(Rt = 0) of the previous trial  DBM determines P (Rt| (cid:126)Rt−1)  where (cid:126)Rt−1 denotes the trial sequence
preceding trial t  i.e.  (cid:126)Rt−1 = (R1  R2  ...  Rt−1).
DBM assumes a generative model  shown in Figure 2a  in which Rt = 1 with probability γt and
Rt = 0 with probability 1−γt. The random variable γt describes a characteristic of the environment.
According to the generative model  the environment is nonstationary and γt can either retain the
same value as on trial t − 1 or it can change. Speciﬁcally  Ct denotes whether the environment
has changed between t − 1 and t (Ct = 1) or not (Ct = 0). Ct is a Bernoulli random variable
with success probability α. If the environment does not change  γt = γt−1. If the environment
changes  γt is drawn from a prior distribution  which we refer to as the reset prior denoted by
p0(γ) ∼ Beta(a  b).
Before each trial t of a 2AFC task  DBM computes the probability of the upcoming stimulus condi-
tioned on the trial history. The model assumes that the perceptual and motor system is tuned based
on this expectation  so that RT will be a linearly decreasing function of the probability assigned to
the event that actually occurs  i.e. of P (Rt = R| (cid:126)Rt−1) on repetition trials and of P (Rt = A| (cid:126)Rt−1)
= 1 - P (Rt = R| (cid:126)Rt−1) on alternation trials.
The red plusses in Figure 1 show DBM’s ﬁt to the data from Cho et al. (2002). DBM has ﬁve
free parameters that were optimized to ﬁt the data. The parameters are: the change probability 
α; the imaginary counts of the reset prior  a and b; and two additional parameters to map model
probabilities to RTs via an afﬁne transform.

2.1

Intuiting DBM predictions

Another contribution of Yu and Cohen (2008) is the mathematical demonstration that DBM is ap-
proximately equivalent to an exponential ﬁlter over trial histories. That is  the probability that the
current stimulus is a repetition is a weighted sum of past observations  with repetitions being scored
as 1 and alternations as 0  and with weights decaying exponentially as a function of lag. The ex-
ponential ﬁlter gives insight into how DBM probabilities will vary as a function of trial history.
Consider two 4-back trial histories: an alternation followed by two repetitions (ARR−) and two
alternations followed by a repetition (AAR−)  where the − indicates that the current trial type is
unknown. An exponential ﬁlter predicts that ARR− will always create a stronger expectation for
an R on the current trial than AAR− will  because the former includes an additional past repetition.
Thus  if the current trial is in fact a repetition  the model predicts a faster RT for ARR− compared
to AAR− (i.e.  RTARRR < RTAARR). Conversely  if the current trial is an alternation  the model

are compared  for example RAR− and ARR−  the model predicts RTRARR > RTARRR and
RTRARA < RTARRA because more recent trials have a stronger inﬂuence.
Comparing the exponential ﬁlter predictions for adjacent sequences in Figure 1 yields the expecta-
tion that the RTs will be monotonically increasing in the left two groups of four and monotonically
decreasing in the two right groups. The data are divided into groups of 4 because the relationships
between histories like AARR and RRAR depend on the speciﬁc parameters of the exponential ﬁl-
ter  which determine whether one recent A will outweigh two earlier As. It is clear in Figure 1 that
the DBM predictions follow this pattern.

2.2 what’s missing in DBM

DBM offers an impressive ﬁt to the overall pattern of the behavioral data. Circled in Figure 1 
however  we see two signiﬁcant pairs of sequence histories for which the monotonicity prediction
does not hold. These are reliable aspects of the data and are not measurement error. Consider
the circle on the left  in which RTARAR > RTRAAR for the human data. Because DBM functions
approximately as an exponential ﬁlter  and the repetition in the trial history is more recent for ARAR
than for RAAR  DBM predicts RTARAR < RTRAAR. An exponential ﬁlter  and thus DBM  is
unable to account for this deviation in the data.
To understand this mismatch  we consider an alternative representation of the trial history: the ﬁrst-
order sequence  i.e.  the sequence of actual stimulus values. The two R/A sequences ARAR and
RAAR correspond to stimulus sequences XY Y XX and XXY XX. If we consider an exponen-
tial ﬁlter on the actual stimulus sequence  we obtain the opposite prediction from that of DBM:
RTXY Y XX > RTXXY XX because there are more recent occurrences of X in the latter sequence.
The other circled data in Figure 1a correspond to an analogous situation. Again  DBM also makes
a prediction inconsistent with the data  that RTARAA > RTRAAA  whereas an exponential ﬁlter on
stimulus values predicts the opposite outcome—RTXY Y XY < RTXXY XY . Of course this analysis
leads to predictions for other pairs of points where DBM is consistent with the data and a stimulus
based exponential ﬁlter is inconsistent. Nevertheless  the variations in the data suggest that more
importance should be given to the actual stimulus values.
In general  we can divide the sequential effects observed in the data into two classes: ﬁrst- and
second-order effects. First-order sequential effects result from the priming of speciﬁc stimulus or
response values. We refer to this as a ﬁrst-order effect because it depends only on the stimulus
values rather than a higher-order representation such as the repetition/alternation nature of a trial.
These effects correspond to the estimation of the baserate of each stimulus or response value. They
are observed in a wide range of experimental paradigms and are referred to as stimulus priming
or response priming. The effects captured by DBM  i.e. the triangular pattern in RT data  can be
thought of as a second-order effect because it reﬂects learning of the correlation structure between
the current trial and the previous trial. In second-order effects  the actual stimulus value is irrelevant
and all that matters is whether the stimulus was a repetition of the previous trial. As DBM proposes 
these effects essentially arise from an attempt to estimate the repetition rate of the sequence.
DBM naturally produces second-order sequential effects because it abstracts over the stimulus level
of description: observations in the model are R and A instead of the actual stimuli X and Y . Because
of this abstraction  DBM is inherently unable to exhibit ﬁrst-order effects. To gain an understanding
of how ﬁrst-order effects could be integrated into this type of Bayesian framework  we reformulate
the DBM architecture. Figure 2b shows an equivalent depiction of DBM in which the generative
process on trial t produces the actual stimulus value  denoted St. St is conditioned on both the
repetition probability  γt  and the previous stimulus value  St−1. Under this formulation  St = St−1
with probability γt  and St equals the opposite of St−1 (i.e.  XY or Y X) with probability 1 − γt.
An additional beneﬁt of this reformulated architecture is that it can represent ﬁrst-order effects if we
switch the meaning of γ. In particular  we can treat γ as the probability of the stimulus taking on a
speciﬁc value (X or Y ) instead of the probability of a repetition. St is then simply a draw from a
Bernoulli process with rate γ. Note that for modeling a ﬁrst-order effect with this architecture  the
conditional dependence of St on St−1 becomes unnecessary. The nonstationarity of the environ-
ment  as represented by the change variable C  behaves in the same way regardless of whether we
use the model to represent ﬁrst- or second-order structure.

3 Dynamic Belief Mixture Model

The complex contributions of ﬁrst- and second-order effects to the full pattern of observed sequential
effects suggest the need for a model with more explanatory power than DBM. It seems clear that
individuals are performing a more sophisticated inference about the statistics of the environment
than proposed by DBM. We have shown that the DBM architecture can be reformulated to generate
ﬁrst-order effects by having it infer the baserate instead of the repetition rate of the sequence  but the
empirical data suggest both mechanisms are present simultaneously. Thus the challenge is to merge
these two effects into one model that performs joint inference over both environmental statistics.
Here we propose a Bayesian model that captures both ﬁrst- and second-order effects  building on the
basic principles of DBM. According to this new model  which we call the Dynamic Belief Mixture
Model (DBM2)  the learner assumes that the stimulus on a given trial is probabilistically affected
by two factors: the random variable φ  which represents the sequence baserate  and the random
variable γ  which represents the repetition rate. The combination of these two factors is governed
by a mixture weight w that represents the relative weight of the φ component. As in DBM  the
environment is assumed to be nonstationary  meaning that on each trial  with probability α  φ and γ
are jointly resampled from the reset prior  p0(φ  γ)  which is uniform over [0  1]2. Figure 2c shows
the graphical architecture for this model. This architecture is an extension of our reformulation of
the DBM architecture in Figure 2b. Importantly  the observed variable  S  is the actual stimulus
value instead of the repetition/alternation representation used in DBM. This architecture allows for
explicit representation of the baserate  through the direct inﬂuence of φt on the physical stimulus
value St  as well as representation of the repetition rate through the joint inﬂuence of γt and the
previous stimulus St−1 on St. Formally  we express the probability of St given φ  γ  and St−1 as
shown in Equation 1.

P (St = X|φt  γt  St−1 = X) = wφt + (1 − w)γt
P (St = X|φt  γt  St−1 = Y ) = wφt + (1 − w)(1 − γt)

(1)

DBM2 operates by maintaining the iterative prior over φ and γ  p(φt  γt|(cid:126)St−1). After each observa-
tion  the joint posterior  p(φt  γt|(cid:126)St)  is computed using Bayes’ Rule from the iterative prior and the
likelihood of the most recent observation  as shown in Equation 2.

p(φt  γt|(cid:126)St) ∝ P (St|φt  γt  St−1)p(φt  γt|(cid:126)St−1).

(2)

The iterative prior for the next trial is then a mixture of the posterior from the current trial  weighted
by 1 − α  and the reset prior  weighted by α (the probability of change in φ and γ).

p(φt+1  γt+1|(cid:126)St) = (1 − α)p(φt  γt|(cid:126)St) + αp0(φt+1  γt+1).

(3)
The model generates predictions  P (St|(cid:126)St−1)  by integrating Equation 1 over the iterative prior on
φt and γt. In our simulations  we maintain a discrete approximation to the continuous joint iterative
prior with the interval [0 1] divided into 100 equally spaced sections. Expectations are computed by
summing over the discrete probability mass function.
Figure 1b shows that DBM2 provides an excellent ﬁt to the Cho et al. data  explaining the combina-
tion of both ﬁrst- and second-order effects. To account for the overall advantage of repetition trials
over alternation trials in the data  a repetition bias had to be built into the reset prior in DBM. In
DBM2  the ﬁrst-order component naturally introduces an advantage for repetition trials. This occurs
because the estimate of φt is shifted toward the value of the previous stimulus  St−1  thus leading
to a greater expectation that the same value will appear on the current trial. This fact eliminates the
need for a nonuniform reset prior in DBM2. We use a uniform reset prior in all DBM2 simulations 
thus allowing the model to operate with only four free parameters: α  w  and the two parameters for
the afﬁne transform from model probabilities to RTs.
The nonuniform reset prior in DBM allows it to be biased either for repetition or alternation. This
ﬂexibility is important in a model  because different experiments show different biases  and the
biases are difﬁcult to predict. For example  the Jentzsch and Sommer experiment showed little

bias  but a replication we performed—with the same stimuli and same responses—obtained a strong
alternation bias. It is our hunch that the bias should not be cast as part of the computational theory
(speciﬁcally  the prior); rather  the bias reﬂects attentional and perceptual mechanisms at play  which
can introduce varying degrees of an alternation bias. Speciﬁcally  four classic effects have been
reported in the literature that make it difﬁcult for individuals to process the same stimulus two times
in a row at a short lag: attentional blink Raymond et al. (1992)  inhibition of return Posner and
Cohen (1984)  repetition blindness Kanwisher (1987)  and the Ranschburg effect Jahnke (1969).
For example  with repetition blindness  processing of an item is impaired if it occurs within 500 ms
of another instance of the same item in a rapid serial stream; this condition is often satisﬁed with
2AFC. In support of our view that fast-acting secondary mechanisms are at play in 2AFC  Jentzsch
and Sommer (Experiment 2) found that using a very short lag between each response and the next
stimulus modulated sequential effects in a difﬁcult-to-interpret manner. Explaining this ﬁnding via
a rational theory would be challenging. To allow for various patterns of bias across experiments  we
introduced an additional parameter to our model  an offset speciﬁcally for repetition trials  which
can serve as a means of removing the inﬂuence of the effects listed above. This parameter plays
much the same role as DBM’s priors. Although it is not as elegant  we believe it is more correct 
because the bias should be considered as part of the neural implementation  not the computational
theory.

4 Other Tests of DBM2

With its ability to represent both ﬁrst- and second-order effects  DBM2 offers a robust model for a
range of sequential effects. In Figure 3a  we see that DBM2 provides a close ﬁt to the data from
Experiment 1 of Jentzsch and Sommer (2002). The general design of this 2AFC task is similar to
the design in Cho et al. (2002) though some details vary. Notably we see a slight advantage on
alternation trials  as opposed to the repetition bias seen in Cho et al.
Surprisingly  DBM2 is able to account for the sequential effects in other binary decision tasks that
do not ﬁt into the 2AFC paradigm. In Experiment 1 of Maloney et al. (2005)  subjects observed
a rotation of two points on a circle and reported whether the direction of rotation was positive
(clockwise) or negative (counterclockwise). The stimuli were constructed so that the direction of
motion was ambiguous  but a particular variable related to the angle of motion could be manipulated
to make subjects more likely to perceive one direction or the other. Psychophysical techniques were
used to estimate the Point of Subjective Indifference (PSI)  the angle at which the observer was
equally likely to make either response. PSI measures the subject’s bias toward perceiving a positive
as opposed to a negative rotation. Maloney et. al. found that this bias in perceiving rotation was
inﬂuenced by the recent trial history. Figure 3b shows the data for this experiment rearranged to be
consistent with the R/A orderings used elsewhere (the sequences on the abscissa show the physical
stimulus values  ending with Trial t − 1). The bias  conditioned on the 4-back trial history  follows
a similar pattern to that seen with RTs in Cho et al. (2002) and Jentzsch and Sommer (2002).

In modeling Experiment 1  we assumed that PSI reﬂects the subject’s probabilistic expectation about
the upcoming stimulus. Before each trial  we computed the model’s probability that the next stimu-
lus would be P  and then converted this probability to the PSI bias measure using an afﬁne transform
similar to our RT transform. Figure 3b shows the close ﬁt DBM2 obtains for the experimental data.
To assess the value of DBM2  we also ﬁt DBM to these two experiments. Table 1 shows the com-
parison between DBM and DBM2 for both datasets as well as Cho et al. The percentage of variance
explained by the models is used as a measure for comparison. Across all three experiments  DBM2
captures a greater proportion of the variance in the data.

5 EEG evidence for ﬁrst-order and second-order predictions

DBM2 proposes that subjects in binary choice tasks track both the baserate and the repetition rate
in the sequence. Therefore an important source of support for the model would be evidence for the
psychological separability of these two mechanisms. One such line of evidence comes from Jentzsch
and Sommer (2002)  who used electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings to provide additional insight
into the mechanisms involved in the 2AFC task. The EEG was used to record subjects’ lateralized
readiness potential (LRP) during performance of the task. LRP essentially provides a way to identify
the moment of response selection—a negative spike in the LRP signal in motor cortex reﬂects initia-
tion of a response command in the corresponding hand. Jentzsch and Sommer present two different
ways of analyzing the LRP data: stimulus-locked LRP (S-LRP) and response-locked LRP (LRP-R).
The S-LRP interval measures the time from stimulus onset to response activation on each trial. The
LRP-R interval measures the time elapsed between response activation and the actual response. To-
gether  these two measures provide a way to divide the total RT into a stimulus-processing stage and
a response-execution stage.
Interestingly  the S-LRP and LRP-R data exhibit different patterns of sequential effects when condi-
tioned on the 4-back trial histories  as shown in Figure 4. DBM2 offers a natural explanation for the
different patterns observed in the two stages of processing  because they align well with the division
between ﬁrst- and second-order sequential effects. In the S-LRP data  the pattern is predominantly
second-order  i.e. RT on repetition trials increases as more alternations appear in the recent history 
and RT on alternation trials shows the opposite dependence. In contrast  the LRP-R results exhibit
an effect that is mostly ﬁrst-order (which could be easily seen if the histories were reordered under
an X/Y representation). Thus we can model the LRP data by extracting the separate contributions
of φ and γ in Equation 1. We use the γ component (i.e.  the second term on the RHS of Eq. 1) to
predict the S-LRP results and the φ component (i.e.  the ﬁrst term on the RHS of Eq. 1) to predict
the LRP-R results. This decomposition is consistent with the model of overall RT  because the sum
of these components provides the model’s RT prediction  just as the sum of the S-LRP and LRP-R
measures equals the subject’s actual RT (up to an additive constant explained below).
Figure 4 shows the model ﬁts to the LRP data. The parameters of the model were constrained to
be the same as those used for ﬁtting the behavioral results shown in Figure 3a. To convert the
probabilities in DBM2 to durations  we used the same scaling factor used to ﬁt the behavioral data
but allowed for new offsets for the R and A groups for both S-LRP and LRP-R. The offset terms
need to be free because the difference in procedures for estimating S-LRP and LRP-R (i.e.  aligning
trials on the stimulus vs.
the response) allows the sum of S-LRP and LRP-R to differ from total
RT by an additive constant related to the random variability in RT across trials. Other than these
offset terms  the ﬁts to the LRP measures constitute parameter-free predictions of EEG data from
behavioral data.

6 More evidence for the two components of DBM2

In the second experiment reported in Maloney et al. (2005)  participants only responded on every
fourth trial. The goal of this manipulation was to test whether the sequential effect occurred in
the absence of prior responses. Each ambiguous test stimulus followed three stimuli for which the
direction of rotation was unambiguous and to which the subject made no response. The responses
to the test stimuli were grouped according to the 3-back stimulus history  and a PSI value was
computed for each of the eight histories to measure subjects’ bias toward perceiving positive vs.
negative rotation. The results are shown in Figure 4c. As in Figure 3b  the histories on the abscissa
show the physical stimulus values  ending with Trial t − 1  and the arrangement of these histories is
consistent with the R/A orderings used elsewhere in this paper.
DBM2’s explanation of Jentzsch and Sommer’s EEG results indicates that ﬁrst-order sequential
effects arise in response processing and second-order effects arise in stimulus processing. Therefore 
the model predicts that  in the absence of prior responses  sequential effects will follow a pure
second-order pattern. The results of Maloney et al.’s Experiment 2 conﬁrm this prediction. Just as
in the S-LRP data of Jentzsch and Sommer (2002)  the ﬁrst-order effects have mostly disappeared 
and the data are well explained by a pure second-order effect (i.e.  a stronger bias for alternation
when there are more alternations in the history  and vice versa). We simulated this experiment with
DBM2 using the same value of the change parameter (α) from the ﬁt of Maloney et al.’s Experiment
1. Additionally  we set the mixture parameter  w  to 0  which removes the ﬁrst-order component of
the model. For this experiment we used different afﬁne transformation values than in Experiment
1 because the modiﬁcations in the experimental design led to a generally weaker sequential effect 
which we speculate to have been due to lesser engagement by subjects when fewer responses were
needed. Figure 4c shows the ﬁt obtained by DBM2  which explains 91.9% data variance.

7 Discussion

Our approach highights the power of modeling simultaneously at the levels of rational analysis and
psychological mechanism. The details of the behavioral data (i.e. the systematic discrepancies from
DBM) pointed to an improved rational analysis and an elaborated generative model (DBM2) that is
grounded in both ﬁrst- and second-order sequential statistics. In turn  the conceptual organization
of the new rational model suggested a psychological architecture (i.e.  separate representation of
baserates and repetition rates) that was borne out in further data. The details of these latter ﬁndings
now turn back to further inform the rational model. Speciﬁcally  the ﬁts to Jentzsch and Sommer’s
EEG data and to Maloney et al.’s intermittent-response experiment suggest that the statistics individ-
uals track are differentially tied to the stimuli and responses in the task. That is  rather than learning
statistics of the abstract trial sequence  individuals learn the baserates (i.e.  marginal probabilities) of
responses and the repetition rates (i.e.  transition probabilities) of stimulus sequences. This division
suggests further hypotheses about both the empirical nature and the psychological representation
of stimulus sequences and of response sequences  which future experiments and statistical analyses
will hopefully shed light on.
