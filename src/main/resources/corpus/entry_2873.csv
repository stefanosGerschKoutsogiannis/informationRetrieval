Abstract 

Recent  advances  in  neuroimaging  techniques  provide  great  potentials  for 
effective diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)  the most common form of 
dementia.  Previous  studies  have  shown  that  AD  is  closely  related  to  the 
alternation  in  the  functional  brain  network   i.e.   the  functional  connectivity 
among  different  brain  regions.  In  this  paper   we  consider  the  problem  of 
learning  functional  brain  connectivity  from  neuroimaging   which  holds 
great  promise  for  identifying  image-based  markers  used  to  distinguish 
Normal  Controls  (NC)   patients  with  Mild  Cognitive  Impairment  (MCI)  
and  patients  with  AD. 
  More  specifically   we  study  sparse  inverse 
covariance  estimation  (SICE)   also  known  as  exploratory  Gaussian 
graphical  models   for  brain  connectivity  modeling.  In  particular   we  apply 
SICE  to  learn  and  analyze  functional  brain  connectivity  patterns  from 
different  subject  groups   based  on  a  key  property  of  SICE   called  the 
“monotone property” we established in this paper. Our experimental results 
on neuroimaging PET data of 42  AD  116 MCI  and 67 NC  subjects reveal 
several  interesting  connectivity  patterns  consistent  with  literature  findings  
and also some new patterns that can help the knowledge discovery of AD.

I n t ro d u c t i o n  

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a fatal  neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive 
impairment  of  memory  and  other  cognitive  functions.  It  is  the  most  common  form  of 
dementia  and  currently  affects  over  five  million  Americans;  this  number  will  grow  to  as 
many  as  14  million  by  year  2050.  The  current  knowledge  about  the  cause  of  AD  is  very 
limited;  clinical  diagnosis  is  imprecise  with  definite  diagnosis  only  possible  by  autopsy; 
also  there is currently no cure for AD  while most drugs only alleviate the symptoms.   

To  tackle  these  challenging  issues   the  rapidly  advancing  neuroimaging  techniques  provide 
great  potentials.  These  techniques   such  as  MRI   PET   and  fMRI   produce  data  (images)  of 
brain  structure  and  function   making  it  possible  to  identify  the  difference  between  AD  and 
normal  brains.  Recent  studies  have  demonstrated  that  neuroimaging  data  provide  more 
sensitive  and  consistent  measures  of  AD  onset  and  progression  than  conventional  clinical 

assessment and neuropsychological tests [1].  

Recent studies have found that AD is closely related to the alternation in the functional brain 
network  i.e.  the functional connectivity among different brain regions [ 2]-[3]. Specifically  
it  has  been  shown  that  functional  connectivity  substantially  decreases  between  the 
hippocampus  and  other  regions  of  AD  brains  [3]-[4].  Also   some  studies  have  found 
increased connectivity between the regions in the frontal lobe [ 6]-[7].  

Learning  functional  brain  connectivity  from  neuroimaging  data  holds  great  promise  for 
identifying  image-based  markers  used  to  distinguish  among  AD   MCI  (Mild  Cognitive 
Impairment)   and  normal  aging.  Note  that  MCI  is  a  transition  stage  from  normal  aging  to 
AD. Understanding and precise diagnosis of MCI have significant clinical value since it can 
serve as an early warning sign of AD. Despite all these  existing research in functional brain 
connectivity  modeling  suffers  from  limitations.  A  large  body  of  functional  connectivity 
modeling  has  been  based  on  correlation  analysis  [2]-[3]   [5].  However   correlation  only 
captures  pairwise  information  and  fails  to  provide  a  complete  account  for  the  interaction  of 
many  (more  than  two)  brain  regions.  Other  multivariate  statistical  methods  have  also  been 
used  such as Principle Component Analysis (PCA) [8]  PCA-based Scaled Subprofile Model 
[9]   Independent  Component  Analysis  [10]-[11]   and  Partial  Least  Squares  [12]-[13]   which 
group  brain  regions  into  latent  components.  The  brain  regions  within  each  component  are 
believed  to  have  strong  connectivity   while  the  connectivity  between  componen ts  is  weak. 
One  major  drawback  of  these  methods  is  that  the  latent  components  may  not  correspond  to 
any  biological  entities   causing  difficulty  in  interpretation.  In  addition   graphical  models 
have  been  used  to  study  brain  connectivity   such  as  structural  equation  models  [14]-[15]  
dynamic causal  models [16]  and Granger causality. However   most of  these approaches are 
confirmative   rather  than  exploratory   in  the  sense  that  they  require  a  prior  model  of  brain 
connectivity to begin with.  This makes them inadequate for studying AD brain connectivity  
because there is little prior knowledge about which regions should be involved and how they 
are connected. This makes exploratory models highly desirable.  

In  this  paper   we  study  sparse  inverse  covariance  estimation  (SICE)   also  known  as 
exploratory Gaussian graphical  models   for brain connectivity  modeling. Inverse covariance 
matrix  has  a  clear  interpretation  that  the  off-diagonal  elements  correspond  to  partial 
correlations   i.e.   the  correlation  between  each  pair  of  brain  regions  given  all  other  regions. 
This  provides  a  much  better  model  for  brain  connectivity  than  simple  correlation  analysis 
which  models  each  pair  of  regions  without  considering  other  regions.  Also   imposing 
sparsity  on  the  inverse  covariance  estimation  ensures  a  reliable  brain  connectivity  to  be 
modeled  with  limited  sample  size   which  is  usually  the  case  in  AD  studies  since  clinical 
samples  are  difficult  to  obtain.  From  a  domain  perspective   imposing  sparsity  is  also  valid 
because  neurological  findings  have  demonstrated  that  a  brain  region  usually  only  directly 
interacts with a few other brain regions in neurological processes [ 2]-[3]. Various algorithms 
for achieving SICE have been developed in recent year [ 17]-[22]. In addition  SICE has been 
used in various applications [17]  [21]  [23]-[26].  

In  this  paper   we  apply  SICE  to  learn  functional  brain  connectivity  from  neuroimaging  and 
analyze the difference among AD  MCI  and NC based on a key property of SICE  called the 
“monotone property” we  established in this paper.  Unlike the previous study which is based 
on  a  specific  level  of  sparsity  [26]   the  monotone  property  allows  us  to  study  the 
connectivity pattern using different levels of sparsity and  obtain an order for the strength of 
connection between pairs of brain regions. In addition  we apply bootstrap hypothesis testing 
to assess the significance of the connection. Our experimental results on PET data of 42 AD  
116  MCI   and  67  NC  subjects  enrolled  in  the  Alzheimer’s  Disease  Neuroimaging  Initiative 
project  reveal  several  interesting  connectivity  patterns  consistent  with  literature  findings  
and also some new patterns that can help the knowledge discovery of AD.

We apply SICE on FDG-PET images for 49 AD  116 MCI  and 67 NC subjects downloaded from 
the  ADNI  website.  We  apply  Automated  Anatomical  Labeling  (AAL)  [28]  to  extract  data  from 
each  of  the  116  anatomical  volumes  of  interest  (AVOI)   and  derived  average  of  each  AVOI  for 
every subject. The AVOIs represent different regions of the whole brain.

42  AVOIs  are  selected  for  brain  connectivity  modeling   as  they  are  considered  to  be  potentially 
related to AD. These regions distribute in the frontal  parietal  occipital  and temporal lobes. Table

used to index the node in the connectivity models.  

We apply the SICE algorithm to learn one connectivity model for AD  one for MCI  and one for 
NC  for a given 
. With different  ’s  the resulting connectivity models hold a monotone property  
which can help obtain an order for the strength of connection between brain regions. To show the 
order  clearly   we  develop  a  tree-like  plot  in  Fig.  1   which  is  for  the  AD  group.  To  generate  this 
plot  we start 
 at a very small value (i.e.  the right-most of the horizontal axis)  which results in a 
fully-connected connectivity model. A fully-connected connectivity model is one that contains no 
region disconnected with the rest of the brain. Then  we decrease 
 by small steps and record the 
order of the regions disconnected with the rest of the brain regions.

For example  in Fig. 1  as 
 decreases below  
 (but still 
the first one becoming disconnected from the rest of the brain. As 
above 
)   the  rest  of  the  brain  further  divides  into  three  disconnected  clusters   including  the 
cluster  of  “Cingulum_Post_R”  and  “Cingulum_Post_L”   the  cluster  of  “Fusiform_R”  up  to 
“Hippocampus_L”  and the cluster of the other regions. As 
 continuously decreases  each current 
cluster will split into smaller clusters; eventually  when 
 reaches a very large value  there will be 
no  arc  in  the  IC  model   i.e.   each  region  is  now  a  cluster  of  itself  and  the  split  will  stop.  The 
sequence  of  the  splitting  gives  an  order  for  the  strength  of  connection  between  brain  regions. 
Specifically  the earlier (i.e.  smaller  ) a region or a cluster of regions becomes disconnected from 
the rest of the brain  the weaker it is connected with the rest of the brain. For example  in Fig. 1  it 
can be known that “Tempora_Sup_L” may be the weakest region in the brain network of AD; the 
second  weakest  ones  are  the  cluster  of  “Cingulum_Post_R”  and  “Cingulum_Post_L”   and  the 
cluster of “Fusiform_R” up to “Hippocampus_L”. It is very interesting to see that the weakest and 
second  weakest  brain  regions 
include  “Cingulum_Post_R”  and 
“Cingulum_Post_L” as well as regions all in the temporal lobe  all of which have been found to be 
affected by AD early and severely [3]-[5].

Next  to facilitate the comparison between AD and NC  a tree-like plot is also constructed for NC  
as  shown  in  Fig.  2.  By  comparing  the  plots  for  AD  and  NC   we  can  observe  the  following  two 
distinct phenomena: First  in AD  between-lobe connectivity tends to be weaker than within-lobe 
connectivity.  This  can  be  seen  from  Fig.  1  which  shows  a  clear  pattern  that  the  lobes  become 
disconnected with each other before the regions within each lobe become disconnected with each 
other   as 
 goes  from  small  to  large.    This  pattern  does  not  show  in  Fig.  2  for  NC.  Second   the 
same brain regions in the left and right hemisphere are connected much weaker in AD than in NC. 
This  can  be  seen  from  Fig.  2  for  NC   in  which  the  same  brain  regions  in  the  left  and  right 
hemisphere are still connected even at a very large 
 for NC. However  this pattern does not show 
in Fig. 1 for AD.  

Furthermore  a tree-like plot is also constructed for MCI (Fig. 3)  and compared with the plots for 
AD and NC. In terms of the two phenomena discussed previously  MCI shows similar patterns to 
AD   but  these  patterns  are  not  as  distinct  from  NC  as  AD.  Specifically   in  terms  of  the  first

which  is  similar  to  AD.  However   the  degree  of  weakerness  is  not  as  distinctive  as  AD.  For 
example   a  few  regions  in  the  temporal  lobe  of  MCI   including  “Temporal_Mid_R”  and 
“Temporal_Sup_R”  appear to be more strongly connected with the occipital lobe than with other 
regions  in  the  temporal  lobe.  In  terms  of  the  second  phenomenon   MCI  also  shows  weaker 
between-hemisphere  connectivity  in  the  same  brain  region  than  NC.  However   the  degree  of 
weakerness  is  not  as  distinctive  as  AD.  For  example   several  left-right  pairs  of  the  same  brain 
regions  are  still  connected  even  at  a  very  large 
   such  as  “Rectus_R”  and  “Rectus_L”  
“Frontal_Mid_Orb_R”  and  “Frontal_Mid_Orb  _L”   “Parietal_Sup_R”  and  “Parietal_Sup_L”   as 
well as “Precuneus_R” and “Precuneus_L”. All above findings are consistent with the knowledge 
that MCI is a transition stage between normal aging and AD.

Furthermore   we  would  like  to  compare  how  within-lobe  and  between-lobe  connectivity  is 
different across AD  MCI  and NC. To achieve this  we first learn one connectivity model for AD  
one  for  MCI   and one  for  NC.  We  adjust  the 
 in  the  learning  of  each  model  such  that  the  three 
models   corresponding  to  AD   MCI   and  NC   respectively   will  have  the  same  total  number  of 
arcs. This is to “normalize” the models  so that the comparison will be more focused on how the 
arcs  distribute  differently  across  different  models.  By  selecting  different  values  for  the  total 
number  of  arcs   we  can  obtain  models  representing  the  brain  connectivity  at  different  levels  of 
strength. Specifically  given a small value for the total number of arcs  only strong arcs will show 
up in the resulting connectivity model  so the model is a model of strong brain connectivity; when 
increasing  the  total  number  of  arcs   mild  arcs  will  also  show  up  in  the  resulting  connectivity 
model  so the model is a model of mild and strong brain connectivity.  

For example  Fig. 4 shows the connectivity models for AD  MCI  and NC with the total number of 
arcs equal to 50 (Fig. 4(a))  120 (Fig. 4(b))  and 180 (Fig. 4(c)). In this paper  we use a “matrix” 
representation for the SICE of a connectivity model. In the matrix  each row represents one node 
and each column also represents one node. Please see Table 1 for the correspondence between the 
numbering of the  nodes and the brain region each number  represents. The  matrix contains black 
and  white cells: a black cell  at the  -th row   -th column of the  matrix represents existence of an 
arc  between  nodes 
 in  the  SICE-based  connectivity  model   whereas  a  white  cell 
represents  absence  of  an  arc.  According  to  this  definition   the  total  number  of  black  cells  in  the 
matrix is equal to twice the total number of arcs in the SICE-based connectivity model. Moreover  
on each matrix  four red cubes are used to highlight the brain regions in each of the four lobes; that 
is   from  top-left  to  bottom-right   the  red  cubes  highlight  the  frontal   parietal   occipital   and 
temporal lobes  respectively. The black cells inside each red cube reflect within-lobe connectivity  
whereas the black cells outside the cubes reflect between-lobe connectivity.  

 and 

While the connectivity  models in Fig. 4 clearly show  some connectivity difference between AD  
MCI   and  NC   it  is  highly  desirable  to  test  if  the  observed  difference  is  statistically  significant. 
Therefore   we  further  perform  a  hypothesis  testing  and  the  results  are  summarized  in  Table  2. 
Specifically  a P-value is recorded in the sub-table if it is smaller than 0.1  such a P-value is further 
highlighted  if  it  is  even  smaller  than  0.05;  a  “---”  indicates  that  the  corresponding  test  is  not 
significant (P-value>0.1). We can observe from Fig. 4 and Table 2:  

Within-lobe  connectivity:  The  temporal  lobe  of  AD  has  significantly  less  connectivity  than  NC. 
This  is  true  across  different  strength  levels  (e.g.   strong   mild   and  weak)  of  the  connectivity;  in 
other words  even the connectivity between some strongly-connected brain regions in the temporal 
lobe  may  be  disrupted  by  AD.  In  particular   it  is  clearly  from  Fig.  4(b)  that  the  regions 
“Hippocampus” and “ParaHippocampal” (numbered by 39-42  located at the right-bottom corner 
of  Fig.  4(b))  are  much  more  separated  from  other  regions  in  AD  than  in  NC.  The  decrease  in 
connectivity in the temporal lobe of AD  especially between the Hippocampus and other regions  
has been extensively reported in the literature [3]-[5]. Furthermore  the temporal lobe of MCI does 
not  show  a  significant  decrease  in  connectivity   compared  with  NC.  This  may  be  because  MCI 
does not disrupt the temporal lobe as badly as AD.

The frontal lobe of AD has significantly more connectivity than NC  which is true across different 
strength  levels  of  the  connectivity.  This  has  been  interpreted  as  compensatory  reallocation  or 
recruitment  of  cognitive  resources  [6]-[7].  Because  the  regions  in  the  frontal  lobe  are  typically 
affected later in the course of AD (our data are early AD)  the increased connectivity in the frontal 
lobe may help preserve some cognitive functions in AD patients. Furthermore  the frontal lobe of 
MCI does not show a significant increase in connectivity  compared with  NC. This indicates that 
the compensatory effect in MCI brain may not be as strong as that in AD brains.

AD  MCI  and NC

There is no significant difference among AD  MCI  and NC in terms of the connectivity within the 
parietal lobe and within the occipital lobe. Another interesting finding is that all the P-values in the 
third  sub-table  of  Table  2(a)  are  insignificant.  This  implies  that  distribution  of  the  strong 
connectivity within and between lobes for MCI is very similar to NC; in other words  MCI has not 
been able to disrupt the strong connectivity among brain regions (it disrupts some mild and weak 
connectivity though).

than within-lobe connectivity. A majority of the strong connectivity occurs within lobes  but rarely 
between  lobes.  These  can  be  clearly  seen  from  Fig.  4  (especially  Fig.  4(a))  in  which  there  are 
much  more black cells along  the diagonal direction than the off-diagonal direction  regardless of 
AD  MCI  and NC.  

The  connectivity  between  the  parietal  and  occipital  lobes  of  AD  is  significantly  more  than  NC 
which is true especially  for mild and  weak connectivity.  The increased connectivity between the 
parietal  and  occipital  lobes  of  AD  has  been  previously  reported  in  [3].  It  is  also  interpreted  as  a 
compensatory effect in [6]-[7]. Furthermore  MCI also shows increased connectivity between the 
parietal and occipital lobes  compared with NC  but the increase is not as significant as AD.  

While the connectivity between the frontal and occipital lobes shows little difference between AD 
and  NC   such  connectivity  for  MCI  shows  a  significant  decrease  especially  for  mild  and  weak 
connectivity.  Also   AD  may  have  less  temporal-occipital  connectivity   less  frontal-parietal 
connectivity  but more parietal-temporal connectivity than NC.   

Between-hemisphere connectivity: Recall that we have observed from the tree-like plots in Figs. 3 
and 4 that the same brain regions in the left and right hemisphere are connected much weaker in 
AD  than  in  NC.  It  is  desirable  to  test  if  this  observed  difference  is  statistically  significant.  To 
achieve this  we test the statistical significance of the difference among AD  MCI  and NC  in term 
of the number of connected same-region left-right pairs. Results show that when the total number 
of arcs in the connectivity models is equal to 120 or 90  none of the tests is significant. However  
when the total number of arcs is equal to 50  the P-values of the tests for “AD vs. NC”  “AD vs. 
MCI”  and “MCI vs. NC” are 0.009  0.004  and 0.315  respectively. We further perform tests for 
the  total  number  of  arcs  equal  to  30  and  find  the  P-values  to  be  0.  0055   0.053   and  0.158  
respectively.  These  results  indicate  that  AD  disrupts  the  strong  connectivity  between  the  same 
regions of the left and right hemispheres  whereas this disruption is not significant in MCI.

In the paper  we applied SICE to model functional brain connectivity of AD  MCI  and NC based 
on PET neuroimaging data  and analyze the patterns based on the monotone property of SICE. Our 
findings were consistent with the previous literature and also showed some new aspects that may 
suggest further investigation in brain connectivity research in the future.
