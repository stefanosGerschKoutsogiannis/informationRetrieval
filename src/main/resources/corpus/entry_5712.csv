Abstract

EEG connectivity measures could provide a new type of feature space for inferring
a subject’s intention in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). However  very little is
known on EEG connectivity patterns for BCIs. In this study  EEG connectivity
during motor imagery (MI) of the left and right is investigated in a broad frequency
range across the whole scalp by combining Beamforming with Transfer Entropy
and taking into account possible volume conduction effects. Observed connec-
tivity patterns indicate that modulation intentionally induced by MI is strongest
in the γ-band  i.e.  above 35 Hz. Furthermore  modulation between MI and rest
is found to be more pronounced than between MI of different hands. This is in
contrast to results on MI obtained with bandpower features  and might provide an
explanation for the so far only moderate success of connectivity features in BCIs.
It is concluded that future studies on connectivity based BCIs should focus on
high frequency bands and consider experimental paradigms that maximally vary
cognitive demands between conditions.

1 Introduction

Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are devices that enable a subject to communicate without uti-
lizing the peripheral nervous system  i.e.  without any overt movement requiring volitional motor
control. The primary goal of research on BCIs is to enable basic communication for subjects unable
to communicate by normal means due to neuro-degenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS). In non-invasive BCIs  this is usually approached by measuring the electric ﬁeld of
the brain by EEG  and detecting changes intentionally induced by the subject (cf. [1] for a general
introduction to BCIs). The most commonly used experimental paradigm in this context is motor
imagery (MI) [2]. In MI subjects are asked to haptically imagine movements of certain limbs  e.g. 
the left or the right hand. MI is known to be accompanied by a decrease in bandpower (usually most
prominent in the µ-band  i.e.  roughly at 8-13 Hz) in that part of the motor cortex representing the
speciﬁc limb [3]. These bandpower changes  termed event related (de-)synchronization (ERD/ERS) 
can be detected and subsequently used for inferring the subject’s intention. This approach to BCIs
has been demonstrated to be very effective in healthy subjects  with only little subject training time
required to achieve classiﬁcation accuracies close to 100% in two-class paradigms [4–6]. Further-
more  satisfactory classiﬁcation results have been reported with subjects in early to middle stages
of ALS [7]. However  all subjects diagnosed with ALS and capable of operating a BCI still had
residual motor control that enabled them to communicate without the use of a BCI. Until now  no
communication has been established with a completely locked-in subject  i.e.  a subject without any
residual motor control. Establishing communication with a completely locked-in subject arguably
constitutes the most important challenge in research on BCIs.

1

Unfortunately  reasons for the failure of establishing communication with completely locked-in sub-
jects remain unknown. While cognitive deﬁcits in completely locked-in patients can at present not
be ruled out as the cause of this failure  another possible explanation is abnormal brain activity ob-
served in patients in late stages of ALS [8]. Our own observations indicate that intentionally induced
bandpower changes in the electric ﬁeld of the brain might be reduced in subjects in late stages of
ALS. To explore the plausibility of this explanation for the failure of current BCIs in completely
locked-in subjects  it is necessary to devise feature extraction algorithms that do not rely on mea-
sures of bandpower. In this context  one promising approach is to employ connectivity measures
between different brain regions. It is well known from fMRI-studies that brain activity during MI is
not conﬁned to primary motor areas  but rather includes a distributed network including pre-motor 
parietal and frontal regions of the brain [9]. Furthermore  synchronization between different brain
regions is known to be an essential feature of cognitive processing in general [10]. Subsequently  it
can be expected that different cognitive tasks  such as MI of different limbs  are associated with dif-
ferent connectivity patterns between brain regions. These connectivity patterns should be detectable
from EEG recordings  and thus offer a new type of feature space for inferring a subject’s intention.
Since measures of connectivity are  at least in principle  independent of bandpower changes  this
might offer a new approach to establishing communication with completely locked-in subjects.

In recent years  several measures of connectivity have been developed for analyzing EEG recordings
(cf. [11] for a good introduction and a comparison of several algorithms). However  very few studies
exist that analyze connectivity patterns as revealed by EEG during MI [12  13]. Furthermore  these
studies focus on differences in connectivity patterns between MI and motor execution  which is not
of primary interest for research on BCIs. In the context of non-invasive BCIs  connectivity measures
have been most notably explored in [14] and [15]. However  these studies only consider frequency
bands and small subsets of electrodes known to be relevant for bandpower features  and do not take
into account possible volume conduction effects. This might lead to misinterpreting bandpower
changes as changes in connectivity. Consequently  a better understanding of connectivity patterns
during MI of different limbs as measured by EEG is required to guide the design of new feature
extraction algorithms for BCIs. Speciﬁcally  it is important to properly address possible volume
conduction effects  not conﬁne the analysis to a small subset of electrodes  and consider a broad
range of frequency bands.

In this work  these issues are addressed by combining connectivity analysis during MI of the left
and right hand in four healthy subjects with Beamforming methods [6]. Since it is well known that
MI includes primary motor cortex [3]  this area is chosen as the starting point of the connectivity
analysis. Spatial ﬁlters are designed that selectively extract those components of the EEG originating
in the left and right motor cortex. Then  the concept of Transfer Entropy [16] is used to estimate
class-conditional ’information ﬂow’ from all 128 employed recording sites into the left and right
motor cortex in frequency bands ranging from 5 - 55 Hz.
In this way  spatial topographies are
obtained for each frequency band that depict by how much each area of the brain is inﬂuencing the
left/right motor cortex during MI of the left/right hand. Interestingly  the most pronounced changes
in connectivity patterns are not observed in MI of the left vs. the right hand  but rather in rest vs. MI
of either hand. Furthermore  these pattern changes are most pronounced in frequency bands not
usually associated with MI. i.e.  in the γ-band above 35 Hz. These results suggest that in order
to fully exploit the capabilities of connectivity measures for BCIs  and establish communication
with completely locked-in subjects  it might be advisable to consider γ-band oscillations and adapt
experimental paradigms as to maximally vary cognitive demands between conditions.

2 Methods

2.1 Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Connectivity Analysis

In analyzing interrelations between time-series data it is important to distinguish symmetric from
asymmetric measures. Consider Fig. 1  depicting two graphs of three random processes s1 to s3 
representing three EEG sources. The goal of symmetric connectivity analysis (Fig. 1.a) is to esti-
mate some instantaneous measure of similarity between random processes  i.e.  assigning weights
to the undirected edges between the nodes of the graph in Fig. 1.a. Amplitude coupling and phase
synchronization fall into this category  which are the measures employed in [14] and [15] for feature
extraction in BCIs. However  interrelations between EEG sources originating in different regions of

the brain can be expected to be asymmetric  with certain brain regions exerting stronger inﬂuence on
other regions than vice versa. For this reason  asymmetric connectivity measures potentially provide
more information on cognitive processes than symmetric measures.

Considering asymmetric relations between random processes requires a deﬁnition of how the inﬂu-
ence of one process on another process is to be measured  i.e.  a quantitative deﬁnition of causal
inﬂuence. The commonly adopted deﬁnition of causality in time-series analysis is that si causes
sj if observing si helps in predicting future observations of sj  i.e.  reduces the prediction error of
sj. This implies that cause precedes effect  i.e.  that the graph in Fig. 1.b may only contain directed
arrows pointing forward in time. Note that there is some ambiguity in this deﬁnition of causality 
since it does not specify a metric for reduction of the prediction error of sj due to observing si. In
Granger causality (cf. [11])  reduction of the variance of the prediction error is chosen as a metric 
essentially limiting Granger causality to linear systems. It should be noted  however  that any other
metric is equally valid. Finally  note that for reasons of simplicity the graph in Fig. 1.b only contains
directed edges from nodes at time t to nodes at time t + 1. In general  directed arrows from nodes at
times t  . . .   t − k to nodes at time t + 1 may be considered  with k the order of the random processes
generating s[t + 1].
To assess Granger causality between bivariate time-series data a linear autoregressive model is ﬁt to
the data  which is then used to compute a 2x2 transfer matrix in the frequency domain (cf. [11]). The
off-diagonal elements of the transfer matrix then provide a measure of the asymmetric interaction
between the observed time-series. Extensions of Granger causality to multivariate time-series data 
termed directed transfer function (DTF) and partial directed coherence (PDC)  have been developed
(cf. [11] and the references therein). However  in this work a related but different measure for asym-
metric interrelations between time-series is utilized. The concept of Transfer Entropy (TE) [16] de-
ﬁnes the causal inﬂuence of si on sj as the reduction in entropy of sj obtained by observing si. More
precisely  let si and sj denote two random processes  and let sk
TE is then deﬁned as

i/j[t] := (cid:0)si/j[t]  . . .   si/j[t − k](cid:1).

Tk (si[t] → sj[t + 1]) := H(cid:0)sj[t + 1]|s

(1)
with k the order of the random processes and H(·) the Shannon entropy. TE can thus be understood
as the reduction in uncertainty about the random process sj at time t + 1 due to observing the past
k samples of the random process si. Both  Granger causality and TE  thus deﬁne causal inﬂuence
as a reduction in the uncertainty of a process due to observing another process  but employ different
metrics to measure reduction in uncertainty. While TE is a measure that applies to any type of
random processes  it is difﬁcult to compute in practice. Hence  in this study only Gaussian processes

with R(·) the (cross-)covariance matrices of the respective random processes [17]. In comparison
to Granger causality and related measures  TE for Gaussian processes possesses several advantages.
It is easy to compute from a numerical perspective  since it does not require ﬁtting a multivariate
autoregressive model including (implicit) inversion of large matrices. Furthermore  for continuous
processes it is invariant under coordinate transformations [17]. Importantly  this entails invariance
with regard to scaling of the random processes.

Computing TE for Gaussian processes requires estimation of the (cross-)covariance matrices
in (2). Consider a matrix S ∈ R2×T ×N   corresponding to data recorded from two EEG

sources during an experimental paradigm with N trials of T samples each. In order to compute
(s1[t] → s2[t + 1]) for t = k + 1  . . .   T − k − 1  it is assumed that in each trial s1[t] and
T GP
k
s2[t] are i.i.d. samples from the distribution p(s1[t]  s2[t])  i.e.  that the non-stationary Gaussian pro-
cesses that give rise to the observation matrix S are identical for each of the N repetitions of the
experimental paradigm. For each instant in time  TE can then be evaluated by computing the sample
(cross-)covariance matrices required in (2) across trials. Note that evaluating (2) requires speciﬁca-
tion of k. In general  k should be chosen as large as possible in order to maximize information on
the random processes contained in the (cross-)covariance matrices. However  choosing k too large
leads to rank deﬁcient matrices with a determinant of zero. Here  for each observation matrix S the
highest possible k is chosen such that none of the matrices in (2) is rank deﬁcient.

2.2 The Problem of Volume Conduction in EEG Connectivity Analysis

The goal of connectivity analysis in EEG recordings is to estimate connectivity patterns between
different regions of the brain. Unfortunately  EEG recordings do not offer direct access to EEG
sources. Instead  each EEG electrode measures a linear and instantaneous superposition of EEG
sources within the brain [18]. This poses a problem for symmetric connectivity measures  since
these assess instantaneous coupling between electrodes [18]. Asymmetric connectivity measures
such as TE  on the other hand  are not based on instantaneous coupling  but rather consider prediction
errors. It is not obvious that instantaneous volume conduction also poses a problem for this type of
measures. Unfortunately  the following example demonstrates that volume conduction also leads to
incorrect connectivity estimates in asymmetric connectivity analysis based on TE.

Example 1 (Volume Conduction Effects in Connectivity Analysis based on Transfer Entropy)
Consider the EEG signals x1[t] and x2[t]  recorded at two electrodes placed on the scalp  that
consist of a linear superposition of three EEG sources s1[t] to s3[t] situated somewhere within the
brain (Fig. 2.a). Let x[t] = (x1[t]  x2[t])T and s[t] = (s1[t]  s2[t]  s3[t])T. Then x[t] = As[t] 
with A ∈ R2×3 describing the projection strength of each source to each electrode. For sake of
simplicity  assume that A = (1 0 1 ; 0 1 1 )  i.e.  that the ﬁrst source only projects to the ﬁrst
electrode with unit strength  the second source only projects to the second electrode with unit
strength  and the third source projects to both electrodes with unit strength. Furthermore  assume
that

i.e.  that all sources have zero mean  unit variance  are mutually independent  and s1 and s2 are
uncorrelated in time. Only s3[t] and s3[t + 1] are assumed to be correlated with covariance γ
(Fig. 2.b). In this setting  it would be desirable to obtain zero TE between both electrodes  since
there is no interaction between the sources giving rise to the EEG. However  some rather tedious
algebraic manipulations reveal that in this case

(4)

Note that (4) is zero if and only if γ = 0  i.e.  if s3 represents white noise. Otherwise  TE between
the two electrodes is estimated to be greater than zero solely due to volume conduction effects from
source s3. Further note that qualitatively this result holds independently of the strength of the
projection of the third source to both electrodes.

2.3 Attenuation of Volume Conduction Effects via Beamforming

One way to avoid volume conduction effects in EEG connectivity analysis is to perform source
localization on the obtained EEG data  and apply connectivity measures on estimated current density
time-series at certain locations within the brain [11]. This is feasible to test certain hypothesis  e.g. 
to evaluate whether there exists a causal link between two speciﬁc points within the brain. However 
testing pairwise causal links between more than just a few points within the brain is computationally

intractable. Accordingly  attenuation of volume conduction effects via source localization is not
feasible if a complete connectivity pattern considering the whole brain is desired. Here  a different
approach is pursued. It is well known that primary motor cortex is central to MI as measured by
EEG [3]. Accordingly  it is assumed that any brain region involved in MI displays some connectivity
to the primary motor cortex. This (admittedly rather strong) assumption enables a complete analysis
of the connectivity patterns during MI covering the whole brain in the following way. First  two
spatial ﬁlters  commonly known as Beamformers  are designed that selectively extract EEG sources
originating within the right and left motor cortex  respectively [6]. In brief  this can be accomplished
by solving the optimization problem

(5)

with Rx ∈ RM ×M the covariance of the recorded EEG  and R˜xl/r ∈ RM ×M model-based spatial
covariance matrices of EEG sources originating within the left/right motor cortex.
In this way 
spatial ﬁlters can be obtained that optimally attenuate the variance of all EEG sources not originating
within the left/right motor cortex. The desired spatial ﬁlters are obtained as the eigenvectors with
w = λRxw (cf. [6] for a more
the largest eigenvalue of the generalized eigenvalue problem R˜xl/r
detailed presentation).

With EEG sources originating within the left and right motor cortex extracted  TE from all EEG
electrodes into the left and right motor cortex can be computed. In this way  volume conduction
effects from all sources within the brain into the left/right motor cortex can be optimally attenuated.
However  volume conduction effects from the left/right motor cortex to any of the EEG electrodes
still poses a problem. Accordingly  it has to be veriﬁed if any positive TE from an EEG electrode
into the left/right motor cortex could be caused by bandpower changes within the left/right motor
cortex. Positive TE from any electrode into the left/right motor cortex can only be considered as a
genuine causal link if it is not accompanied by a bandpower change in the respective motor cortex.

3 Experimental Results

To investigate connectivity patterns during MI the following experimental paradigm was employed.
Subjects sat in a dimly lit and shielded room  approximately two meters in front of a silver screen.
Each trial started with a centrally displayed ﬁxation cross. After three seconds  the ﬁxation cross was
overlaid with a centrally placed arrow pointing to the left or right. This instructed subjects to begin
MI of the left or right hand  respectively. Subjects were explicitly instructed to perform haptic MI 
but the exact choice of the type of imaginary hand movement was left unspeciﬁed. After a further
seven seconds the arrow was removed  indicating the end of the trial and start of the next trial. 150
trials per class were carried out by each subjects in randomized order. During the experiment  EEG
was recorded at 128 electrodes placed according to the extended 10-20 system with electrode Cz as
reference. EEG data was re-referenced to common average reference ofﬂine. Four healthy subjects
participated in the experiment  all of which were male and right handed with an age of 27 ± 2.5
years. For each subject  electrode locations were recorded with an ultrasound tracking system. No
artifact correction was employed and no trials were rejected.
For each subject  model-based covariance matrices R˜xl/r for EEG sources within the left/right motor
cortex were computed as described in [6]. The EEG covariance matrix Rx was computed for each
subject using all available data  and the two desired Beamformers  extracting EEG sources from the
left and right motor cortex  were computed by solving (5). The EEG sources extracted from the
left/right motor cortex as well as the unﬁltered data recorded at each electrode were then bandpass-

5

ﬁltered with sixth-order Butterworth ﬁlters in ﬁve frequency bands ranging from 5 to 55 Hz in steps
of 10 Hz. Then  TE was computed from all EEG electrodes into the left/right motor cortex at each
sample point as described in Section 2.1. Furthermore  for each subject class-conditional bandpower
changes (ERD/ERS) of sources extracted from the left/right motor cortex were computed in order
to identify frequency bands with common modulations in bandpower and TE. Two subjects showed
signiﬁcant modulations of bandpower in all ﬁve frequency bands. These were excluded from further
analysis  since any observed positive TEs could have been confounded by volume conduction. The
resulting topographies of mean TE between conditions of the two remaining subjects are shown
in Fig. 3. Here  the ﬁrst two columns show mean TE from all electrodes into the left/right motor
cortex during MI of either hand (3.5-10s) minus mean TE during baseline (0.5-3s) in each of the
ﬁve frequency bands. The last two columns show mean differences in TE into the left/right motor
cortex between MI of the left and right hand (both conditions also baseline corrected). Note that
the topographies in Fig. 3 have been normalized to the maximum difference across conditions to
emphasize differences between conditions. Interestingly  no distinct differences in TE are observed
between MI of the left and right hand. Instead  strongest differences in TE are observed in rest
vs. MI of either hand (left two columns). The amount of decrease in TE during MI relative to
rest increases with higher frequencies  and is most pronounced in the γ-band from 45-55 Hz (last
row  left two columns). Topographically  strongest differences are observed in frontal  pre-central 
and post-central areas. Observed changes in TE are statistically signiﬁcant with signiﬁcance level
α = 0.01 at all electrodes in Fig. 3 marked with red crosses (statistical signiﬁcance was tested non-
parametrically and individually for each subject  Beamformer  and condition by one thousand times
randomly permuting the EEG data of each recorded trial in time and testing the null-hypothesis that
changes in TE at least as large as those in Fig.3 are observed without any temporal structure being
present in the data). Due to computational resources only a small subset of electrodes was tested
for signiﬁcance. The observed changes in TE display opposite modulations in comparison to mean
bandpower changes observed in left/right motor cortex relative to baseline (Fig. 4  only signiﬁcant
(α = 0.01) bandpower changes relative to baseline (0-3s) plotted). Here  strongest modulation of
bandpower is found in the µ- (∼ 10 Hz) and β-band (∼ 25 Hz). Frequencies above 35 Hz show very
little modulation  indicating that the observed differences in TE at high frequencies in Fig. 3 are not
due to volume conduction but genuine causal links.

4 Discussion

In this study  Beamforming and TE were employed to investigate the topographies of ’informa-
tion ﬂow’ into the left and right motor cortex during MI as measured by EEG. To the best of the
author’s knowledge  this is the ﬁrst study investigating asymmetric connectivity patterns between
brain regions during MI of different limbs considering a broad frequency range  a large number of
recordings sites  and properly taking into account volume conduction effects. However  it should
be pointed out that there are several issues that warrant further investigation. First  the presented
results are obtained from only two subjects  since two subjects had to be excluded due to possible
volume conduction effects. Future studies with more subjects are required to validate the obtained
results. Also  no outﬂow from primary motor cortex and no TE between brain regions not including
primary motor cortex have been considered. Finally  the methodology presented in this study can
not be applied in a straight-forward manner to single-trial data  and is thus only of limited use for
actual feature extraction in BCIs.

Never the less  the obtained results indicate that bandpower changes in motor cortex and connectiv-
ity between motor cortex and other regions of the brain are processes that occupy distinct spectral
bands and are modulated by different cognitive tasks. In conjunction with the observation of no
distinct changes in connectivity patterns between MI of different limbs  this indicates that in [14]
and [15] bandpower changes might have been misinterpreted as connectivity changes. This is further
supported by the fact that these studies focused on frequency bands displaying signiﬁcant modula-
tion of bandpower (8-30 Hz) and did not control for volume conduction effects. In conclusion  the
pronounced modulation of connectivity between MI of either hand vs. rest in the γ-band observed in
this study underlines the importance of also considering high frequency bands in EEG connectivity
analysis. Furthermore  since the γ-band is thought to be crucial for dynamic functional connectivity
between brain regions [10]  future studies on connectivity patterns in BCIs should consider exper-
imental paradigms that maximally vary cognitive demands in order to activate different networks
within the brain across conditions.
