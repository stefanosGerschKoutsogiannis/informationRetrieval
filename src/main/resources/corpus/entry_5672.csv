Abstract

This paper considers the problem of transferring experimental ﬁndings learned
from multiple heterogeneous domains to a target domain  in which only limited
experiments can be performed. We reduce questions of transportability from mul-
tiple domains and with limited scope to symbolic derivations in the causal calcu-
lus  thus extending the original setting of transportability introduced in [1]  which
assumes only one domain with full experimental information available. We further
provide different graphical and algorithmic conditions for computing the transport
formula in this setting  that is  a way of fusing the observational and experimen-
tal information scattered throughout different domains to synthesize a consistent
estimate of the desired effects in the target domain. We also consider the issue of
minimizing the variance of the produced estimand in order to increase power.

1 Motivation

Transporting and synthesizing experimental knowledge from heterogeneous settings are central to
scientiﬁc discovery. Conclusions that are obtained in a laboratory setting are transported and applied
elsewhere in an environment that differs in many aspects from that of the laboratory. In data-driven
sciences  experiments are conducted on disparate domains  but the intention is almost invariably to
fuse the acquired knowledge  and translate it into some meaningful claim about a target domain 
which is usually different than any of the individual study domains.
However  the conditions under which this extrapolation can be legitimized have not been formally
articulated until very recently. Although the problem has been discussed in many areas of statistics 
economics  and the health sciences  under rubrics such as “external validity” [2  3]  “meta-analysis”
[4]  “quasi-experiments” [5]  “heterogeneity” [6]  these discussions are limited to verbal narratives
in the form of heuristic guidelines for experimental researchers – no formal treatment of the prob-
lem has been attempted to answer the practical challenge of generalizing causal knowledge across
multiple heterogeneous domains with disparate experimental data posed in this paper.
The ﬁelds of artiﬁcial intelligence and statistics provide the theoretical underpinnings necessary for
tackling transportability. First  the distinction between statistical and causal knowledge has received
syntactic representation through causal diagrams [7  8  9]  which became a popular tool for causal
inference in data-driven ﬁelds. Second  the inferential machinery provided by the causal calculus
(do-calculus) [7  9  10] is particularly suitable for handling knowledge transfer across domains.
Armed with these techniques  [1] introduced a formal language for encoding differences and com-
monalities between domains accompanied with necessary or sufﬁcient conditions under which trans-
portability of empirical ﬁndings is feasible between two domains  a source and a target; then  these
conditions were extended for a complete characterization for transportability in one domain with un-
restricted experimental data [11]. Subsequently  these results were generalized for the settings when

only limited experiments are available in the source domain [12  13]  and further for when multiple
source domains with unrestricted experimental information are available [14  15]. This paper broad-
ens these discussions introducing a more general setting in which multiple heterogeneous sources
with limited and distinct experiments are available  a task that we call here “mz-transportability”.1
More formally  the mz-transportability problem concerns with the transfer of causal knowledge
from a heterogeneous collection of source domains Π = {π1  ...  πn} to a target domain π∗. In each
domain πi ∈ Π  experiments over a set of variables Zi can be performed  and causal knowledge
gathered. In π∗  potentially different from πi  only passive observations can be collected (this con-
straint is weakened later on). The problem is to infer a causal relationship R in π∗ using knowledge
obtained in Π. Clearly  if nothing is known about the relationship between Π and π∗  the problem is
trivial; no transfer can be justiﬁed. Yet the fact that all scientiﬁc experiments are conducted with the
intent of being used elsewhere (e.g.  outside the lab) implies that scientiﬁc progress relies on the as-
sumption that certain domains share common characteristics and that  owed to these commonalities 
causal claims would be valid in new settings even where experiments cannot be conducted.
The problem stated in this paper generalizes the one-dimensional version of transportability with
limited scope and the multiple dimensional with unlimited scope. Remarkably  while the effects of
interest might not be individually transportable to the target domain from the experiments in any of
the available sources  combining different pieces from the various sources may enable the estimation
of the desired effects (to be shown later on). The goal of this paper is to formally understand under
which conditions the target quantity is (non-parametrically) estimable from the available data.
2 Previous work and our contributions

Consider Fig. 1(a) in which the node S represents factors that produce differences between source
and target populations. Assume that we conduct a randomized trial in Los Angeles (LA) and es-
timate the causal effect of treatment X on outcome Y for every age group Z = z  denoted by
P (y|do(x)  z). We now wish to generalize the results to the population of the United States (U.S.) 
but we ﬁnd the distribution P (x  y  z) in LA to be different from the one in the U.S. (call the latter
P ∗(x  y  z)). In particular  the average age in the U.S. is signiﬁcantly higher than that in LA. How
are we to estimate the causal effect of X on Y in U.S.  denoted R = P ∗(y|do(x))? 2 3
The selection diagram for this example (Fig. 1(a)) conveys the assumption that the only difference
between the two populations are factors determining age distributions  shown as S → Z  while age-
speciﬁc effects P ∗(y|do(x)  Z = z) are invariant across populations. Difference-generating factors
are represented by a special set of variables called selection variables S (or simply S-variables) 
which are graphically depicted as square nodes ((cid:4)). From this assumption  the overall causal effect
in the U.S. can be derived as follows:

R = (cid:88)
= (cid:88)

z

P ∗(y|do(x)  z)P ∗(z)

P (y|do(x)  z)P ∗(z)

(1)

z

The last line is the transport formula for R.
It combines experimental results obtained in LA 
P (y|do(x)  z)  with observational aspects of the U.S. population  P ∗(z)  to obtain an experimental
claim P ∗(y|do(x)) about the U.S.. In this trivial example  the transport formula amounts to a simple
re-calibration (or re-weighting) of the age-speciﬁc effects to account for the new age distribution.
In general  however  a more involved mixture of experimental and observational ﬁndings would
be necessary to obtain a bias-free estimate of the target relation R. Fig. 1(b) depicts the smallest
example in which transportability is not feasible even when experiments over X in π are available.
In real world applications  it may happen that certain controlled experiments cannot be conducted
in the source environment (for ﬁnancial  ethical  or technical reasons)  so only a limited amount

1The machine learning literature has been concerned about discrepancies among domains in the context 
almost exclusively  on predictive or classiﬁcation tasks as opposed to learning causal or counterfactual measures
[16  17]. Interestingly enough  recent work on anticausal learning moves towards more general modalities of
learning and also leverages knowledge about the underlying data-generating structure [18  19].

2We will use Px(y | z) interchangeably with P (y | do(x)  z).

of experimental information can be gathered. A natural question arises whether the investigator in
possession of a limited set of experiments would still be able to estimate the desired effects at the
target domain. For instance  we assume in Fig. 1(c) that experiments over Z1 are available and the
target quantity is R = P ∗(y|do(x))  which can be shown to be equivalent to P (y|x  do(Z1))  the
conditional distribution of Y given X in the experimental study when Z1 is randomized. 4
One might surmise that multiple pairwise z-transportability would be sufﬁcient to solve the mz-
transportability problem  but this is not the case. To witness  consider Fig. 2(a b) which concerns
the transport of experimental results from two sources ({πa  πb}) to infer the effect of X on Y
in π∗  R = P ∗(y|do(x)).
In these diagrams  X may represent the treatment (e.g.  cholesterol
level)  Z1 represents a pre-treatment variable (e.g.  diet)  Z2 represents an intermediate variable
(e.g.  biomarker)  and Y represents the outcome (e.g.  heart failure). We assume that experimental
studies randomizing {Z1  Z2} can be conducted in both domains. A simple analysis based on [12]
can show that R cannot be z-transported from either source alone  but it turns out that combining in
a special way experiments from both sources allows one to determine the effect in the target.
More interestingly  we consider the more stringent scenario where only certain experiments can
be performed in each of the domains. For instance  assume that it is only possible to conduct
experiments over {Z2} in πa and over {Z1} in πb. Obviously  R will not be z-transported in-
dividually from these domains  but it turns out that taking both sets of experiments into account 
z2 P (a)(y|do(z2))P (b)(z2|x  do(Z1))  which fully uses all pieces of experimental data avail-
able. In other words  we were able to decompose R into subrelations such that each one is separately
z-transportable from the source domains  and so is the desired target quantity. Interestingly  it is the
case in this example that if the domains in which experiments were conducted were reversed (i.e. 
{Z1} randomized in πa  {Z2} in πb)  it will not be possible to transport R by any method – the
target relation is simply not computable from the available data (formally shown later on).
This illustrates some of the subtle issues mz-transportability entails  which cannot be immediately
cast in terms of previous instances of the transportability class. In the sequel  we try to better under-
stand some of these issues  and we develop sufﬁcient or (speciﬁc) necessary conditions for deciding
special transportability for arbitrary collection of selection diagrams and set of experiments. We fur-
ther construct an algorithm for deciding mz-transportability of joint causal effects and returning the
correct transport formula whenever this is possible. We also consider issues relative to the variance
of the estimand aiming for improving sample efﬁciency and increasing statistical power.

3 Graphical conditions for mz-transportability

The basic semantical framework in our analysis rests on structural causal models as deﬁned in [9 
pp. 205]  also called data-generating models. In the structural causal framework [9  Ch. 7]  actions
are modiﬁcations of functional relationships  and each action do(x) on a causal model M produces

4A typical example is whether we can estimate the effect of cholesterol (X) on heart failure (Y ) by experi-

ments on diet (Z1) given that cholesterol levels cannot be randomized [20].

X ∈ X with a new function that outputs a constant value x given by do(x). 5
We follow the conventions given in [9]. We denote variables by capital letters and their realized
values by small letters. Similarly  sets of variables will be denoted by bold capital letters  sets of
realized values by bold small letters. We use the typical graph-theoretic terminology with the corre-
sponding abbreviations P a(Y)G and An(Y)G  which will denote respectively the set of observable
parents and ancestors of the node set Y in G. A graph GY will denote the induced subgraph G con-
taining nodes in Y and all arrows between such nodes. Finally  GXZ stands for the edge subgraph
of G where all incoming arrows into X and all outgoing arrows from Z are removed.
Key to the analysis of transportability is the notion of “identiﬁability ” deﬁned below  which ex-
presses the requirement that causal effects are computable from a combination of data P and as-
sumptions embodied in a causal graph G.
Deﬁnition 1 (Causal Effects Identiﬁability (Pearl  2000  pp. 77)). The causal effect of an action
do(x) on a set of variables Y such that Y ∩ X = ∅ is said to be identiﬁable from P in G if Px(y)
is uniquely computable from P (V) in any model that induces G.

Causal models and their induced graphs are usually associated with one particular domain (also
called setting  study  population  or environment). In ordinary transportability  this representation
was extended to capture properties of two domains simultaneously. This is possible if we assume
that the structural equations share the same set of arguments  though the functional forms of the
equations may vary arbitrarily [11]. 6
Deﬁnition 2 (Selection Diagram). Let (cid:104)M  M∗(cid:105) be a pair of structural causal models [9  pp. 205]
relative to domains (cid:104)π  π∗(cid:105)  sharing a causal diagram G. (cid:104)M  M∗(cid:105) is said to induce a selection
diagram D if D is constructed as follows:

1. Every edge in G is also an edge in D;
2. D contains an extra edge Si → Vi whenever there might exist a discrepancy fi (cid:54)= f∗

i or

P (Ui) (cid:54)= P ∗(Ui) between M and M∗.

In words  the S-variables locate the mechanisms where structural discrepancies between the two
domains are suspected to take place.7 Alternatively  the absence of a selection node pointing to
a variable represents the assumption that the mechanism responsible for assigning value to that
variable is identical in both domains.

5The results presented here are also valid in other formalisms for causality based on potential outcomes.
6As discussed in the reference  the assumption of no structural changes between domains can be relaxed 

but some structural assumptions regarding the discrepancies between domains must still hold.

7Transportability assumes that enough structural knowledge about both domains is known in order to sub-
stantiate the production of their respective causal diagrams. In the absence of such knowledge  causal discovery
algorithms might be used to infer the diagrams from data [8  9].

Deﬁnition 3 (mz-Transportability). Let D = {D(1)  ...  D(n)} be a collection of selection diagrams
relative to source domains Π = {π1  ...  πn}  and target domain π∗  respectively  and Zi (and Z∗)

The requirement that R is uniquely computable from (cid:104)P ∗  I∗
z(cid:105) from all sources has a
syntactic image in the causal calculus  which is captured by the following sufﬁcient condition.
Theorem 1. Let D = {D(1)  ...  D(n)} be a collection of selection diagrams relative to source
domains Π = {π1  ...  πn}  and target domain π∗  respectively  and Si represents the collection of
S-variables in the selection diagram D(i). Let {(cid:104)P i  I i
z(cid:105) be respectively the pairs of
observational and interventional distributions in the sources Π and target π∗. The relation R =
P ∗(y|do(x)  w) is mz-transportable from Π to π∗ in D if the expression P (y|do(x)  w  S1  ...  Sn)
is reducible  using the rules of the causal calculus  to an expression in which (1) do-operators that
apply to subsets of I i

z have no Si-variables or (2) do-operators apply only to subsets of I∗
z .

z(cid:105)} and (cid:104)P ∗  I∗

This result provides a powerful way to syntactically establish mz-transportability  but it is not im-
mediately obvious whether a sequence of applications of the rules of causal calculus that achieves
the reduction required by the theorem exists  and even if such sequence exists  it is not obvious how
to obtain it. For concreteness  we illustrate this result using the selection diagrams in Fig. 2(a b).
Corollary 1. P ∗(y|do(x)) is mz-transportable in Fig. 2(a b) with Za = {Z2} and Zb = {Z1}.
Proof. The goal is to show that R = P ∗(y|do(x)) is mz-transportable from {πa  πb} to π∗ using
experiments conducted over {Z2} in πa and {Z1} in πb. Note that naively trying to transport R
from each of the domains individually is not possible  but R can be decomposed as follows:

P ∗(y|do(x)) = P ∗(y|do(x)  do(Z1))

where Eq. (5) follows from the theorem (and the deﬁnition of selection diagram)  Eq. (6) follows
from rule 1 of the causal calculus since (Sa ⊥⊥ Y |Z1  Z2  X)D
  Eq. (7) follows from rule
3 of the causal calculus since (Z1  X ⊥⊥ Y |Z2)D
. Note that this equation matches with the
syntactic goal of Theorem 1 since we have precisely do(z2) separated from Sa (and Z2 ∈ I a
z ); so 
we can rewrite the expression which results in Eq. (8) by the deﬁnition of selection diagram.

. Note that this equation matches the condition of the
theorem  separate do(Z1) from Sb (i.e.  experiments over Z1 can be used since they are available in
πb)  so we can rewrite Eq. (12) using the deﬁnition of selection diagrams  the corollary follows.
The next condition for mz-transportability is more visible than Theorem 1 (albeit weaker)  which
also demonstrates the challenge of relating mz-transportability to other types of transportability.

Corollary 2. R = P ∗(y|do(x)) is mz-transportable in D if there exists Z(cid:48)

Remarkably  randomizing Z2 when applying Corollary 1 was instrumental to yield transportability
in the previous example  despite the fact that the directed paths from Z2 to Y were not blocked by X 
which suggests how different this transportability is from z-identiﬁability. So  it is not immediately
obvious how to combine the topological relations of Zi’s with X and Y in order to create a general
condition for mz-transportability  the relationship between the distributions in the different domains
can get relatively intricate  but we defer this discussion for now and consider a simpler case.
It is not usually trivial to pursue a derivation of mz-transportability in causal calculus  and next we
show an example in which such derivation does not even exist. Consider again the diagrams in Fig.
2(a b)  and assume that randomized experiments are available over {Z1} in πa and {Z2} in πb.
Theorem 2. P ∗(y|do(x)) is not mz-transportable in Fig. 2(a b) with Za = {Z1} and Zb = {Z2}.

identiﬁcation of causal effects [22  23] (and a version of the identiﬁcation algorithm called ID).
The rationale behind TRmz is to apply Tian’s factorization and decompose the target relation into
smaller  more manageable sub-expressions  and then try to evaluate whether each sub-expression
can be computed in the target domain. Whenever this evaluation fails  TRmz tries to use the exper-
iments available from the target and  if possible  from the sources; this essentially implements the
declarative condition delineated in Theorem 1. Next  we consider the soundness of the algorithm.
Theorem 3 (soundness). Whenever TRmz returns an expression for P ∗

x(y)  it is correct.

In the sequel  we demonstrate how the algorithm works through the mz-transportability of Q =
P ∗(y|do(x)) in Fig. 2(c d) with Z∗ = {Z1}  Za = {Z2}  and Zb = {Z1}.
Since (V \ X) \ An(Y)DX
= {Z2}  TRmz invokes line 3 with {Z2} ∪ {X} as interventional
set. The new call triggers line 4 and C(D \ {X  Z2}) = {C0  C1  C2  C3}  where C0 = DZ1 
C1 = DZ3  C2 = DU   and C3 = DW Y   we invoke line 4 and try to mz-transport individ-
ually Q0 = P ∗
(cid:80)
x z1 z2 z3 w y(u)  and Q3 =
P ∗
x z1 z2 z3 u(w  y). Thus the original problem reduces to try to evaluate the equivalent expression
z1 z3 u w P ∗

x z2 z3 u w y(z1)  Q1 = P ∗

x z1 z2 u w y(z3)  Q2 = P ∗

x z1 z2 u w y(z3) P ∗

x z2 z3 u w y(z1)P ∗

x z1 z2 z3 w y(u)P ∗

x z1 z2 z3 u(w  y).

expression Q1

triggering line 2  which implies

x z2 z3 u w y(z1) = P ∗(z1).

First  TRmz evaluates the expression Q0 and triggers line 2  noting that all nodes can be ignored
since they are not ancestors of {Z1}  which implies after line 1 that P ∗
Second  TRmz
that
P ∗
x z1 z2 u w y(z3) = P ∗
x z1 z2(z3) with induced subgraph D1 = DX Z1 Z2 Z3. TRmz goes to line 5 
in which in the local call C(D \ {X  Z1  Z2}) = {DZ3}. Thus it proceeds to line 6 testing whether
C(D \ {X  Z1  Z2}) is different from D1  which is false. In this call  ordinary identiﬁability would
fail  but TRmz proceeds to line 9. The goal of this line is to test whether some experiment can
help for computing Q1. In this case  πa fails immediately the test in line 10  but πb and π∗ succeed 
which means experiments in these domains may eventually help; the new call is P (i)
x z2(z3)D\Z1  for
i = {b ∗} with induced graph D(cid:48)
1 = DX Z2 Z3. Finally  TRmz triggers line 8 since X is not part
1 (or  Z3 ∈ C(cid:48) = {Z2 (cid:76)(cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) Z3})  so line 2 is triggered since Z2 is no
of Z3’s components in D(cid:48)
longer an ancestor of Z3 in D(cid:48)
1  and then line 1 is triggered since the interventional set is empty in
this local call  so P ∗

Third  evaluating the expression Q2  TRmz goes to line 2  which implies that P ∗
x z1 z2 z3 w y(u) =
P ∗
x z1 z2 z3 w(u) with induced subgraph D2 = DX Z1 Z2 Z3 W U . TRmz goes to line 5  and
in this local call C(D \ {X  Z1  Z2  Z3  W}) = {DU}  and the test in 6 succeed  since there

it triggers line 8 since W is not part of U’s component

x z1 z2 z3 w(u) = P ∗
in D2. The algorithm makes P ∗
x z1 z2 z3(u)D2|W (and update the work-
ing distribution); note that in this call  ordinary identiﬁability would fail since the nodes are
in the same C-component and the test in line 6 fails. But TRmz proceeds to line 9 trying

Fourth  TRmz evaluates the expression Q3 and triggers line 5  C(D\{X  Z1  Z2  Z3  U}) = DW Y .
In turn  both tests at lines 6 and 7 succeed  which makes the procedure to return P ∗
x z1 z2 z3 u(w  y) =
P ∗(w|z3  x  z1  z2)P ∗(y|w  x  z1  z2  z3  u).

represents the weight for each factor in estimand k (i = 1  ...  nk)  and nk is the number
of feasible estimands of k. Eq. (15) depicts a powerful way to estimate P ∗(y|do(x)) in the target
domain  and depending on weighting choice a different estimand will be entailed. For instance  one
might use an analogous to inverse-variance weighting  which sets the weights for the normalized
inverse of their variances (i.e.  w(k)
j is the variance of the jth compo-
nent of estimand k). Our strategy resembles the approach taken in meta-analysis [4]  albeit the latter
usually disregards the intricacies of the relationships between variables  so producing a statistically
less powerful estimand. Our method leverages this non-trivial and highly structured relationships  as
exempliﬁed in Eq. (15)  which yields an estimand with less variance and statistically more powerful.
5 Conclusions
In this paper  we treat a special type of transportability in which experiments can be conducted only
over limited sets of variables in the sources and target domains  and the goal is to infer whether a
certain effect can be estimated in the target using the information scattered throughout the domains.
We provide a general sufﬁcient graphical conditions for transportability based on the causal calculus
along with a necessary condition for a speciﬁc scenario  which should be generalized for arbitrary
structures. We further provide a procedure for computing transportability  that is  generate a formula
for fusing the available observational and experimental data to synthesize an estimate of the desired
causal effects. Our algorithm also allows for generic weighting schemes  which generalizes standard
statistical procedures and leads to the construction of statistically more powerful estimands.
