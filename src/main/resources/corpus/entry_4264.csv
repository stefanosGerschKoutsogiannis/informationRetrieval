Abstract

Consistently matching keypoints across images  and the related problem of ﬁnd-
ing clusters of nearby images  are critical components of various tasks in Com-
puter Vision  including Structure from Motion (SfM). Unfortunately  occlusion
and large repetitive structures tend to mislead most currently used matching algo-
rithms  leading to characteristic pathologies in the ﬁnal output. In this paper we
propose a new method  Permutations Diffusion Maps (PDM)  and a related new
afﬁnity measure  Permutation Diffusion Afﬁnity (PDA)  to solve this problem.
PDM is inspired by Vector Diffusion Maps  recently introduced by Singer and
Wu  and uses ideas from the theory of Fourier analysis on the symmetric group.
We show that when dealing with difﬁcult datasets  using PDM as a preprocessing
step to existing SfM pipelines can signiﬁcantly improve results.

1 Introduction

Structure from motion (SfM) is the task of jointly reconstructing 3D scenes and camera poses from
a set of images. Keypoints or features extracted from each image provide correspondences between
pairs of images  making it possible to estimate the relative camera pose. This gives rise to an
association graph in which two images are connected by an edge if they share a sufﬁcient number of
corresponding keypoints  and the edge itself is labeled by the estimated matching between the two
sets of keypoints. Starting with these putative image to image associations  one typically uses the so-
called bundle adjustment procedure to simultaneously solve for the global camera pose parameters
and 3-D scene locations  incrementally minimizing the sum of squares of the re-projection error.
Despite their popularity  large scale bundle adjustment methods have well known limitations. In
particular  due to the highly nonlinear nature of the objective function  they can get stuck in bad lo-
cal minima. Therefore  starting with a good initial matching (i.e.  an informative image association
graph) is critical. Several papers have studied this behavior in detail [1]  and conclude that if one
starts the numerical optimization from an incorrect “seed” (i.e.  a subgraph of the image associa-
tions)  the downstream optimization is unlikely to ever recover.
Similar challenges arise in other ﬁelds  ranging from machine learning [2] to computational biology.
For instance  consider the de novo genome assembly problem in computational biology [3]. The
goal here is to reconstruct the original DNA sequence from fragments without a reference genome.
Because the genome may have many repeated structures  the alignment problem becomes very hard.
In general  reconstruction algorithms start with two maximally overlapping sequences  and proceed
by selecting subsequents fragment using a process not unlike bundle adjustment  prone to similar
issues with local minima [4]. In both cases it would be preferable to have a model that reasons glob-
ally over all pairwise information. In this paper  to make our presentation as concrete as possible

we restrict ourselves to describing such an algorithm in the context of Structure from Motion  while
understanding that the underlying ideas apply more generally.
Several authors [5  6  7] have recently described situations in large scale structure from motion
where setting up a good image association graph is difﬁcult  and consequently a direct applica-
tion of bundle adjustment yields unsatisfactory results. One such situation is when the scene de-
picted in the images involves a large number of duplicate structures (Figure 1). The preprocessing
step in a standard pipeline will
match visual features and set
up the associations accordingly 
but a key underlying assumption
in most (if not all) approaches
is that we observe only a sin-
gle instance of any structure.
This assumption is problematic
when scenes have repeating ar-
chitectural components or recur-
ring patterns  such as windows 
bricks  and so on.
In Figure 1a views that look exactly the same do not necessarily represent the same physical struc-
ture. Some (or all) points in one image are actually occluded in the other image. Typical SfM
methods will not work well when initialized with such image associations  regardless of which type
of solver we use. In our example  the resulting reconstruction will be folded (Figure 1b). In other
cases [5]  we get errors ranging from phantom walls to severely superimposed structures yielding
nonsensical reconstructions.

Related Work. The issue described above is variously known in the literature as the SfM dis-
ambiguation problem or the data/image association problem in structure from motion. Some of
the strategies that have been proposed to mitigate it impose additional conditions  such as in
[10  11  12  13  14  15]  but this also breaks down in the presence of large coherent sets of in-
correctly matched pairs. One creative solution in recent work is to use metadata alongside images.
“Geotags” or GIS data when available have been shown to be very effective in deriving a better
initialization for bundle adjustment or as a post-processing step to stitch together different compo-
nents of a reconstruction. In [6]  the authors suggest using image timestamps to impose a natural
association among images  which is valuable when the images are acquired by a single camera in a
temporal sequence but difﬁcult to deploy otherwise. Separate from the metadata approach  in con-
trolled scenes with relatively less occlusion  missing correspondences yield important local cues to
infer potentially incorrect image pairs [6  7]. Very recently  [5] formalized the intuition that incor-
rect feature correspondences result in anomalous structures in the so-called visibility graph of the
features. By looking at a measure of local track quality (from local clustering)  one can reason about
which associations are likely to be erroneous. This works well when the number of points is very
large  but the authors of [5] acknowledge that for datasets like those shown in Fig. 1  it may not help
much.
In contrast to the above approaches  a number of recent algorithms for the association (or disam-
biguation) problem argue for global geometric reasoning.
In [16]  the authors used the number
of point correspondences as a measure of certainty  which was then globally optimized to ﬁnd a
maximum-weight set of consistent pairwise associations. The authors in [17] seek consistency of
epipopolar geometry constraints for triplets  whereas [18] expands it over larger consistent cliques.
The procedure in [16] takes into account loops of associations concurrently with a minimal spanning
tree over image to image matches. In summary  the bulk of prior work suggests that locally based
statistics over chained transformations will run into problems if the inconsistencies are more global
in nature. However  even if the objectives used are global  approximate inference is not known to be
robust to coherent noise  which is exactly what we face in the presence of duplicate structures [19].

This paper.
If we take the idea of reasoning globally about association consistency using triples
or higher order loops to an extreme  it implies deriving the likelihood of a speciﬁc image to image
association conditioned on all other associations. This joint likelihood does not factor and explicit
enumeration quickly becomes intractable. Our approach will make the group structure of image to

2

image relationships explicit. Similarly to prior approaches  we will also operate on the association
graph derived from image pairs but with a key distinguishing feature. The association relationships
will now be denoted in terms of a ‘certiﬁcate’  that is  the transformation which justiﬁes the rela-
tionship. The transformation may denote the pose parameters derived from the correspondences or
the matching (between features) itself. Other options are possible — as long as this transformation
is a group action from one set to the other. If so  we can carry over the intuition of consistency over
larger cliques of images desired in existing works and rewrite those ideas as invariance properties of
functions deﬁned on the group. In particular  when the transformation is a matching  each edge in the
graph is a permutation  i.e.  a member of the symmetric group Sn  and a generalization of the Lapla-
cian related to the representation theory of Sn encodes the associations. In this regard  the present
paper owes the most to the literature of synchronization problems  speciﬁcally [20][21][22][23][24].
The key contribution of this paper is to show that the global inference desired in many existing
works falls out nicely as a diffusion process using such a Laplacian. We show promising results
demonstrating that for various difﬁcult datasets with large repetitive patterns  results from a simple
decomposition procedure are  in fact  competitive with those obtained using sophisticated optimiza-
tion schemes with/without metadata. Finally  we note that the proposed algorithm can either be used
standalone to derive meaningful inputs to a bundle adjustment procedure or as a preprocessing step
to other approaches (especially ones that incorporate timestamps and/or GPS data).

Consider a collection of m images fI1;I2; : : : ;Img of the same object or scene taken from different

detector has detected n landmarks (keypoints) fxi

image Ii and xj

Assuming that both images contain exactly the same n landmarks  the matching between Ii and
Ij may be described by the unique permutation (cid:28)ji : f1; 2; : : : ; ng ! f1; 2; : : : ; ng under which
(cid:28)ji(p). Typically  local image features  such as SIFT descriptors  can provide an initial guess
xi
p
for each (cid:28)ji  but by itself each of these individual image-to-image matchings is highly error prone 
especially in the presence of occlusion and repetitive structures. A major clue to correcting these
errors is the constraint that matchings must be consistent  i.e.  if (cid:28)ji tells us that xi
p corresponds to
r   then the permutation (cid:28)ki between Ii and Ik should
q  and (cid:28)kj tells us that xj
xj
r . Mathematically  this is a reﬂection of the fact that  deﬁning the product of two

the n! different permutations of f1; 2; : : : ; ng form a group. This group is called the symmetric
group of order n and is denoted Sn. In group theoretical notation the consistency conditions reduce
to requiring that given any three images Ii;Ij and Ik  the relative matchings between them must
satisfy (cid:28)kj(cid:28)ji = (cid:28)ki. An equivalent condition is that it must be possible to associate to each Ii a “base
permutation” (cid:27)i so that (cid:28)ji = (cid:27)j(cid:27)
for any (i; j) pair. Thus  the problem of ﬁnding a consistent set
of (cid:28)ji’s is reduced to ﬁnding the m base permutations (cid:27)1; : : : ; (cid:27)m.
Problems of this general form  where given some (ﬁnite or continuous) group G  one must estimate
a matrix (gji)m
j;i=1 of group elements obeying gkjgji = gki are called synchronization problems.
Starting with the seminal work of Singer et al. [20][21] on synchronization over the rotation group
for aligning images in cryo-EM  followed by synchronization over the Euclidean group [25]  and
most recently synchronization over Sn for matching landmarks [23][24]  such problems have re-
cently generated a lot of interest. Some of the newest and most promising approaches involve
semi-deﬁnite programming [15][24][26].
In the context of synchronizing three dimensional rotations for cryo-EM  Singer and Wu [22] pro-
posed a particularly elegant formalism  called Vector Diffusion Maps  which conceives of synchro-
nization as diffusing the base rotation Qi from each image to its neighbors. However  unlike in
ordinary diffusion  as Qi diffuses to Ij  the observed Oji relative rotation of Ij to Ii changes Qi
to OjiQi. If all the (Oji)i;j observations were perfectly synchronized  then no matter what path

3

i ! i1 ! i2 ! : : : ! j we took from i to j  the resulting rotation Oj;ip : : : Oi2;i1 Oi1;iQi would
be the same. However  if some (in many practical cases  the majority) of the Oji’s are incorrect 
then different paths from one vertex to another contribute different rotations  which one then needs
to average in some appropriate sense.
A natural choice for the loss that describes the extent to which the Q1; : : : ; Qm imputed base rota-
tions (playing the role of the (cid:27)i’s in the permutation case) satisfy the Oji observations is

As it is well known  constraining f to have unit norm and excluding the subspace of constant func-
tions  the function minimizing E(f ) is the eigenvector of L with (second) smallest eigenvalue. Anal-
ogously  in synchronizing rotations  the steady state of the diffusion system  which minimizes (1) 
can be computed by forming the 3m(cid:2)3 dimensional matrix V from the 3 lowest non-zero eigenvalue
eigenvectors of L  and appropriately rounding each 3(cid:2)3 block Vi of V to the nearest orthogonal ma-

trix Qi. The resulting array (QjQ

and minimizes the loss (1).

3 Permutation Diffusion

Its elegance notwithstanding  the vector diffusion formalism of the previous section seems ill suited
to our present purposes of improving the SfM pipeline for two reasons: (1) synchronizing over
Sn  which is a ﬁnite group  seems much harder than synchronizing over the continuous group of
rotations; (2) rather than getting an actual synchronized array of matchings  what is critical to SfM
is to estimate the association graph that captures the extent to which any two images are related to
one-another. The main contribution of the present paper is to show that both of these problems have
natural solutions in the formalism of group representations.
Our ﬁrst key observation (already alluded to in [21]) is that the critical step of rewriting the loss
(1) in terms of the Laplacian (2) does not depend on any special properties of the rotation group
other than the facts that (a) rotation matrices are unitary (in fact  orthogonal) (b) if we follow one
rotation by another  their matrices simply multiply. In general  for any group G  a complex valued
function (cid:26) : G ! Cd(cid:26)(cid:2)d(cid:26) which satisﬁes (cid:26)(g2 g1) = (cid:26)(g2) (cid:26)(g1) is called a representation of G. The
y denotes the Hermitian conjugate
representation is unitary if (cid:26)(g
(conjugate transpose) of M. Thus  we have the following proposition.
Proposition 1. Let G be any compact group with identity e and (cid:26) : G ! Cd(cid:26)(cid:2)d(cid:26) be a unitary
representation of G. Then given an array of possibly noisy and unsynchronized group elements 
(gji)i;j  and corresponding positive conﬁdence weights (wji)i;j  the synchronization loss (assuming
gii = e for all i)

To synchronize matchings between images using this proposition  one plugs in the approriate unitary
representation of the symmetric group. The simplest choice is the so-called deﬁning representation 
whose elements are the familiar permutation matrices

Consequently  just as in the rotation case  synchronization over Sn can be solved by forming V from
the ﬁrst d(cid:26)def = n lowest eigenvectors of L  and extracting each Pi from its i’th n (cid:2) n block  Vi.
Here we must take a little care because unless the (cid:28)ji’s are already synchronized  it is not a priori
to ﬁnd the permutationb(cid:27)i  whose permutation matrix is closest to ViV
guaranteed that the resulting block will be a valid permutation matrix. Therefore  analogously to the
⊤
procedure described in [23]  we ﬁrst multiply Vi by V
1   and then use a linear assignment procedure
⊤
1 . The resulting algorithm we

call Synchronization by Permutation Diffusion.

4 Uncertain Matches and Permutation Diffusion Afﬁnity

The limitation of our framework  as described so far  is the assumption that each keypoint in each
image will have a single counterpart in every other image that the local matching procedure with
some error can identify. In realistic scenarios this is far from satisﬁed  due to occlusion  repetitive
structures  and noisy detections. Most algorithms  including [24] and [23]  deal with the problem
simply by turning the Pij block in (5) into a weighted sum of all possible permutations. For example 
if landmarks number 1. . . 20 are present in both images  but landmarks 21 : : : 40 are not  then the
Pij block in (5) will have a corresponding 20(cid:2) 20 block of all ones  rescaled by a factor of 1=20.
This approach effectively amounts to replacing (cid:28)ji by an appropriate distribution tji((cid:28) ) over match-
ings. Correspondingly  when we form V from the ﬁrst d(cid:26) eigenvectors of L  each resulting Vi block
will stand for a distribution pi((cid:27))  rather than a single base permutation (cid:27)i. Moreover  if some set
of k landmarks U = (u1; : : : ; uk) are occluded in Ii  then tij (for any j) will be agnostic to their
assignment  and consequently pi will be invariant to what is mapped to u1; : : : ; uk. Let (cid:27)(cid:24)U (cid:27)
′ de-
′ differ only in what numbers they map to u1; : : : ; uk 
note the relation that two permutations (cid:27) and (cid:27)
but fully agree on what they assign to any landmark not in U (i.e.  (cid:27)(i) = (cid:27)(j) 8 i ̸2 U). Clearly 
(cid:24)U is an equivalence relation on Sn  and it is not difﬁcult to see that letting (cid:22)U be some reference
permutation that maps 1 7! u1; : : : ; k 7! uk  and Sk be the subgroup of permutations that permute
1; 2; : : : ; k amongst themselves but leave k + 1; : : : ; n ﬁxed  the equivalence classes of (cid:24)U are the
sets
(6)
These sets are called (two-sided) Sk–cosets. Note that while jSnj = n!  there are only n!=k! distinct
equivalence classes  so not all possible values of (cid:23) yield a distinct coset.
What is important is that uncertainty in the synchronization process with respect to a given set of
landmarks fu1; : : : ; ukg (typically due to occlusion) has a clear algebraic signature  namely the

(cid:22)U Sk (cid:23) := f(cid:22)U (cid:13) (cid:23) j (cid:13) 2 Skg

inferred pi being constant on each of the cosets in (6). Conversely  if we ﬁnd that pi is constant
on these cosets  that is a strong indication that u1; : : : ; uk are occluded  which is an important clue
to estimating Ii’s viewpoint  sometimes even more informative than the synchronized matchings
themselves.

5 Experiments

Our experiments focus on challenging image association problems from the literature  where ge-
ometric ambiguities due to large duplicate structures are present in up to 50% of the matches  so
even sophisticated SfM pipelines run into difﬁculties [6]. Rather than replacing the standard SfM
pipeline with Permutations Diffusion Maps (PDM) altogether  our general approach is to use PDM
as a preprocessing step to compute (8) for every image pair  and then feed these PDA scores into the
SfM pipeline to improve its performance. More information on the experiments  including videos
of 3D reconstructions  and an additional experiment on scene summarization rather than SfM [31] 
can be found on the project website: http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/˜pachauri/pdm/.

In the SfM experiments we used PDM to generate an image match matrix which is then fed to a
state-of-the-art SfM pipeline for 3D reconstruction [8  9]. The baseline was a Bundle Adjustment
procedure which uses visual features for matching and has a built-in heuristic outlier removal mod-
ule. Several other papers have used a similar comparisons [6]. For each dataset  SIFT was used
to detect and characterize landmarks [32  33]. We compute putative pairwise matchings ((cid:28)ij)m
i;j=1
linear independent assignments [34] based on their SIFT features. The permutation
by solving
matrix representation is used for putative matchings ((cid:28)ij)m
i;j=1 as in (5). Here  n is relative large 
on the order of 1000. Ideally  n is the total number of distinct keypoints in the 3D scene  but is
not directly observable  so we set n to be the maximum number of keypoints detected in any single
image in the dataset. Eigenvector based procedure computes weighted afﬁnity matrix. We used a
binary match matrix as the input to an SfM library [8  9]. Note that we only provide this library the
image association hypotheses  leaving all other modules unchanged. With (potentially) good image
association information  the SfM modules can sample landmarks more densely and perform bundle
adjustment  leaving everything else unchanged. The baseline 3D reconstruction is performed using
the same SfM pipeline without intervention.
The “HOUSE” sequence has three instances of similar looking houses (Figure 1). The diffusion
process accumulates evidence and eventually provides strongly connected images in the data asso-
ciation matrix (Figure 2a). Warm colors correspond to high afﬁnity between pairs of images. The
binary match matrix was obtained by applying a threshold on the weighted matrix (Figure 2b). We
used this matrix to deﬁne the image matching for feature tracks. This means that features are only
matched between images that are connected in our matching matrix. The SfM pipeline was given
these image matches as a hypotheses to explain how the images are “connected”. The resulting
reconstruction correctly gives three houses (Figure 2c). In contrast  the same SfM pipeline when
allowed to track features automatically with an outlier removal heuristic resulted in a folded recon-
struction (Figure 1b). One may ask if more specialized heuristics will do better  such as time stamps 
as suggested in [6]. However  experimental results in [5] and elsewhere strongly suggests that these
datasets still remain challenging.

The “CUP” dataset has multiple images of a 180 degree symmetric cup from all sides (Figure 3a).
PDM reveals a strongly connected component along the diagonal for this dataset  shown in warm
colors in Figure 3b. Our global reasoning over the space of permutations substantially mitigates
coherent errors. The binary match matrix was obtained by thresholding the weighted matrix (Fig-
ure 3c). As is evident from the reconstructions  the baseline method only reconstruct a “half cup”.
Due to the structural ambiguity  it also concludes that the cup has two handles (Figure 4b). In con-
trast  the PDM reconstruction gives a perfect reconstruction of the full cup with a single handle
(Figure 4a).

The “OAT” dataset contains two instances of a red oat box  one on the left of a box of “Wheat
Thins”  and another on the right (Figure 5a). The PDM weighted match matrix and binary match

matrix successfully discover strongly connected components  (Figures 5b  5c). The baseline method
confused the two oat boxes as one  and reconstructs only a single box  (Figure 6b). Moreover  the
structural ambiguity splits the Wheat Thins into two pieces. On the other hand  PDM gives a nice
reconstruction of the two oat boxes with the entire wheat things in the middle  Figure 6(a). Several
more experiments (with videos)  can be found on the project website.

6 Conclusions

Inspired by the Vector Diffusion formalism of [22]  we have proposed a new algorithm called Per-
mutation Diffusion Maps for solving permutation synchronization problems  and an associated new
afﬁnity measure called Permutation Diffusion Afﬁnity (PDA). Experiments show that the latter  in
particular  can signiﬁcantly improve the quality of Structure from Motion reconstructions of dif-
ﬁcult scenes. Interestingly  PDA has an interpretation in terms of the inner product between two
autocorrelation functions expressed in Fourier space  which  we believe  is a new approach to de-
tecting hidden symmetries  with many potential applications even outside the realm of permutation
problems.
