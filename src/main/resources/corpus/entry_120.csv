Abstract

Direct democracy  where each voter casts one vote  fails when the average voter
competence falls below 50%. This happens in noisy settings when voters have lim-
ited information. Representative democracy  where voters choose representatives to
vote  can be an elixir in both these situations. We introduce a mathematical model
for studying representative democracy  in particular understanding the parameters
of a representative democracy that gives maximum decision making capability. Our
main result states that under general and natural conditions 

1. for ﬁxed voting cost  the optimal number of representatives is linear;
2. for polynomial cost  the optimal number of representatives is logarithmic.

Introduction

Suppose a voter-population of size n must vote in a referendum to make an important binary decision
to optimize some objective  e.g. social welfare growth over 10 years. A typical solution is direct
democracy which decides based on a majority vote  the so called “wisdom of the crowd.” Direct
democracy works when the crowd does indeed have wisdom. In reality  the voters cannot directly
observe which decision is correct. Instead  they form beliefs using perceived information  which can
be inaccurate  misinterpretable or even manipulated. For example  suppose that each voter’s chance
to vote for the correct decision  called her competence  is i.i.d. generated uniformly over [0  0.99].
Now  the majority among many voters makes the wrong decision with near certainty [17].
This highlights a ﬂaw of direct democracy  where voters participate in decision-making irrespective
of their competence. The problems arise in high noise situations  where peoples’ beliefs between
two choices are nearly split  as in the example above. Such close ties are common in real high-stakes
scenarios. For example  in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum 
51.89% voted for leave and 48.11% voted for remain. In the 2016 US Presidential Election  46.1%
voted for Trump and 48.2% voted for Clinton.1 How can democracy cope with high-stakes noisy
issues where the average voter competence may drop below 0.5  especially if there is misinformation?
One promising rescue is representative democracy  where voters form groups  each group chooses a
representative  and the representatives decide via a majority vote. The tradeoff is that there are fewer
representatives than base-voters  but  in return  each representative is (hopefully) better informed 
being the “wisest” from its group  or at least having a higher competence than the average of its group
members. Continuing the example above  let us now use representative democracy  where people are
divided into households (e.g. 5 people per group)  and let each group choose the member with highest
competence as its representative. Then  with high probability the representative’s competence is

1These examples are only used to show real situations where close ties exist. We do not know if direct

democracy would succeed or fail in these cases since we do not know what the “correct” outcome is.

strictly larger than 0.5. Now  with enough representatives  a majority vote will now make the correct
decision with near certainty [17].
It is widely accepted that representative democracy is efﬁcient (lower operational cost and better
turnout than direct democracy)  yet there is still debate on a fundamental question: which democracy
makes better decisions? We are not aware of any mathematical framework for analyzing representative
democracy w.r.t. its ability to make correct decisions. This is in contrast to direct democracy  which
has been mathematically analyzed in depth to provide a justiﬁcation of the “wisdom of the crowd ”
which dates back to the Condorcet Jury Theorem [13]. Roughly speaking  the Jury Theorem states
that a large group of competent voters are likely to make a correct decision by majority voting  which
“lays  among other things  the foundations of the ideology of the democratic regime” [33]. Direct
democracy is just a representative democracy where each group has one voter. Thus  a mathematical
characterization of optimal representative democracies would also highlight the subcases where
direct democracy is best. The goal of this paper is to establish rigorous mathematical foundations of
representative democracy  and provide quantitative answers to the following key questions:

Q1: What is the optimal number of representatives for representative democracy?
Q2: How should electoral group-sizes be distributed (each group has one representative)?

We will answer these questions in a general setting  where the groups satisfy a weak form of
homogeneity with respect to representative election. A concrete example of homogeneity is when
each group  which maybe of different sizes  runs the same type of election process on its members
who are independent and drawn from some underlying voter-distribution.
In our analysis  we consider two cases. The ﬁrst is when there is a ﬁxed cost for the voting. In this
case  the goal of the representative democracy is to maximize the chances of making the correct
decision. This case is relevant to making extremely important decisions where the operational cost of
voting is not considered a valid tradeoff for correctness (e.g. presidential election). The second case
is when the cost of voting increases with the number of representatives who vote. In this case  one
must balance the cost with the beneﬁt that accrues to all n individuals.
Our Contributions. We provide a novel mathematical model of representative democracy w.r.t. its
ability to make correct decisions and characterize the optimal number of representatives as follows.

1. When the cost of voting is ﬁxed  Θ(n) representatives is optimal. (n is the population size).
2. When the cost and beneﬁt of voting are both polynomial  O(log n) representatives is optimal.
In our basic model  there is a single binary issue to be decided and n voters are divided into L groups.
Each group chooses a representative by a representative selection function  and the representatives
will use majority voting to decide a binary issue. Each voter is characterized by her competence  which
is the probability for her vote to be correct; voter competence is generated i.i.d. from a distribution F .
Let Ben(n) ∈ R denote the beneﬁt of making the correct decision compared to making the wrong
decision for n voters  and let Cost(L) ∈ R denote the operational cost for L representatives to vote.
We reduce representative selection to a group competence function µ : N → [0  1]  mapping a group’s
size to the expected competence of its representative. We then extend the Condorcet Jury Theorem to
representative democracy by characterizing group competence functions for which the representative
democracy makes the correct decision with probability 1 as n → ∞. We informally summarize our
main theorems  which are surprising characterizations of the optimal number of representatives.
Theorems 2  3  4 (Optimal representative democracy with ﬁxed voting cost.) Under natural and
mild conditions on the group competence function µ and when Cost(L) = constant:
1. (Homogeneous groups) The optimal group size K∗(n) is at most a constant independent of n.
2. (Inhomogeneous groups) The optimal number of representatives L∗ is linear in n.
3. The optimal group size distribution is nearly homogeneous.

These results hold  independently of the speciﬁc details of the representative selection process. Let us
highlight why the result is unexpected in a concrete context. Suppose voter competence is drawn from
some continuous density on [0  1] and a group elects the most competent of its voters as representative
(very optimistic since it cannot get better than that). Then by choosing larger and larger groups 
the competence of the representative approaches 1. The price paid is that there are fewer of these
ultra-smart representatives  but there will still be many of them as n → ∞. Indeed  one might posit
that some optimal tradeoff exists whereby the group size tends to inﬁnity but at a slower rate than
n  so that the representatives get smarter and smarter and there are more and more representatives.
Our theorem establishes the contrary. The optimal group size will never exceed some constant (the
constant’s value may depend on the speciﬁc parameters of the selection process).

2

To prove our results  we use novel combinations of combinatorial bounds. In addition  some of
our results may be of independent interest  for example  Lemma 7 in the full version answers an
open question on the probability for majority voting to be correct when the average competence of
voters is exactly 0.5 where there are no general results for the non-asymptotic behavior [17] and the
asymptotic behavior is only conjectured [32  Lemma 5].
We then consider the case of polynomial cost and polynomial beneﬁt: for q1  q2 > 0  Cost(L) = Lq1
and Ben(n) = nq2. A special case is linear cost and linear gain  where q1 = q2 = 1. The cost of
voting has a signiﬁcant impact on the optimal group size.
Theorem 5 (Optimal representative democracy with polynomial cost and beneﬁt). Under natural
and mild conditions on the group competence function µ  when Cost(L)

Ben(n) = Θ( Lq1

nq2 ):

1. The optimal number of representatives is in O(log n).
2. When µ(K) polynomially converges to 1  the optimal number of representatives is in Θ(log n).
3. If µ(K) is bounded below 1  the optimal number of representatives is in Θ(1).

Our analysis can be extended to the situation where representatives will have to vote on d > 1 possibly
correlated issues. This is the case with the US Senate and House members  who after election may
have to cast a vote on multiple occasions on different issues (about once per week). We defer these
results to the full version.
Related Work and Discussion. In the US  each House member represents about 700K people 
which used to be as low as 33K. Many favor enlarging the House [18  3  22]. We provide a
mathematical foundation to analyze such choices. Mathematical models of representative democracy
exist  e.g. [10  1]  however none quantitatively characterizes optimal representative democracy
w.r.t. its decision-accuracy. Our work is related to extensions of The Condorcet Jury Theorem
to heterogeneous agents [29  21  30]. Along this vein are three subareas: (1) understanding the
conditions for consistency of the majority [32  33  24  17  37]  (2) studying optimal population size to
maximize correctness [16  27  20  34  7  4  28  26  8  9  38  6]  and (3) incentivizing voters to increase
their competence [29  25  5]. See [31] for a recent survey  including extensions to strategic voters.
Our work is related to the ﬁrst two subareas (consistency and optimal size). The key differences
are  ﬁrst  in our work  the competence of the representatives is endogenous to our model  a result of
partitioning and representative selection  while the competence of voters in the literature is given.
Second  in our work  our setting has a tradeoff: increasing the number of representatives means
weaker representatives  and hence may decrease the overall correctness. We give quantitative analysis
of the quality vs. quantity tradeoff in representative democracy. Our results also extend to multiple
issues (discussed in the full version).
Our work is related to some recent work in proxy voting or liquid (delegative) democracy [12  23].
Our voting dynamic is different because voters are not allowed to delegate to an arbitrary voter 
and representatives cannot delegate their votes. Technically  we require minimal assumptions on
the representative selection process. We also consider cost of voting  which is not considered in
[12  23]. There is recent work in computational social choice on using statistics to make better
decisions [14  11  40  41  36  35  15  2  39]  which focuses on direct (not representative) democracy.

2 Mathematical Model of Representative Democracy

In this section we propose a mathematical model for representative democracy for one issue. As
in the Condorcet Jury Theorem  we assume that voters’ ability to vote for the correct decision is
drawn i.i.d. from a distribution F . The voters are divided into L ≥ 1 groups. For any group (cid:96) with
K voters  whose competences are {q(cid:96) 1  . . .   q(cid:96) K}  a deterministic or randomized representative
selection process V(cid:96) chooses a member q(cid:96). The chosen representative casts a vote  and majority
voting succeeds if strictly more than half of representatives vote 1. The process for a group to choose
a representative to vote is summarized below.

generate voters

Deﬁnition 1. A representative democracy for one issue is composed of the following components.
• Issue. Suppose there is one issue to decide  whose outcome is 1 (correct)  and 0 (incorrect).

i=1 Ki = n.

• Partition function (cid:126)K. For any number of voters n  (cid:126)K denotes a partition function that divides n

voters into L(n) groups  that is  (cid:126)K(n) = (K1  . . .   KL(n)) > 0 and(cid:80)L(n)

• Distribution of competence F . We assume that each voter’s type is characterized by her com-
petence  which is the probability for her to vote for 1. Each voter’s competence is i.i.d. from a
distribution F over [0  1].
• Representative selection process V(cid:96). Suppose group (cid:96) has K users whose competences are
q(cid:96) 1  . . .   q(cid:96) K respectively. The group uses a (randomized) process V(cid:96)(q(cid:96) 1  . . .   q(cid:96) K) to select a
representative q(cid:96)  whose vote is represented by a random variable x(cid:96).
• Voting by the representatives. The chosen representatives will vote for 1 with probability equiva-
lent to her competence  and vote for 0 otherwise. The majority rule is used to decide the outcome
based on representatives’ votes. We assume that a strict majority of votes is necessary to make the
correct decision. That is  when there is a tie  the outcome is 0 (incorrect).

When each group has exactly 1 member  we obtain the direct democracy  otherwise we have the
representative democracy as in the following example.
Example 1 (Uniform Voters with Uniform Process). Suppose there are L ≥ 1 groups  each group
has K ≥ 1 members. Each voter’s competence is i.i.d. from Uniform[a  b]. For all groups  V(cid:96) chooses
a member uniformly at random. It is not hard to see that majority voting by the representatives is
(cid:4)
correct with probability no more than 0.5 when a + b < 1.

We note that the vote of group (cid:96)’s representative  i.e. the random variable x(cid:96)  is characterized entirely
by its expectation  which contains all information needed in the analysis in this paper. Therefore  we
will simplify the representative selection process to a single group competence function µ  which
speciﬁes the expected competence of the representative as a function of the group size K.
Deﬁnition 2. A representative democracy is a group competence function µ : N (cid:55)→ [0  1].
For example  the group competence function for the uniform process in Example 1 can be represented
by µU(K) = (a + b)/2 for all K. We will see that the group competence function signiﬁcantly
simpliﬁes the process in the following two examples. In the next example  the group chooses its
most-informed member—the one with the highest competence—as the representative.
Example 2 (Max Process). As in Example 1  suppose F = Uniform[a  b]. Each group now chooses
the member with the highest competence as the representative. So q(cid:96) = max{q(cid:96) 1  . . .   q(cid:96) K}  which
means (q(cid:96) − a)/(b − a) ∼ Beta(K  1) [19]  from which µmax = E[x(cid:96)] = (a + Kb)/(K + 1). (cid:4)
The group competence function for MAX process is monotonically increasing in K  between a and
b  while the group competence function for UNIFORM process outputs the same value for all K.
The MAX process is an upper bound on group competence functions. Competence may not be
observable as in Example 2. However  when the group size is not too large  for example a group is a
household  then it is natural to assume that the family members are able to choose the max-informed
representative. Even if the process is noisy  it is reasonable to expect more competent voters to have
higher probability to become the representative  as in the noisy-max process below.
Example 3 (Noisy-Max Process). Continuing with Example 1  let (cid:126)p = (p1  . . .   pK) satisfy
i=1 pi = 1. For i ≤ K  choose the member with i-th highest com-
petence as the representative with probability pi. Then  µ(cid:126)p(K) = ((cid:126)p · (cid:126)k+)a + ((cid:126)p · (cid:126)k−)b  where
(cid:4)
(cid:126)k+ = 1

p1 ··· ≥ pK ≥ 0 and(cid:80)K

K+1 (1  2  . . .   K) and (cid:126)k− = 1

K+1 (K  K − 1  . . .   1).

3 Optimal Representative Democracy for One Issue

We ﬁrst extend the classical Condorcet Jury Theorem to representative democracy. Let us formally
deﬁne consistency  the main desired property of a democracy. As the population increases  i.e.
asymptotic in n  it should be possible to partition the voters into L groups  with potentially different
number of voters in each group  such that with probability 1 the majority representatives vote for 1.
Given (cid:126)K = (K1  . . .   KL(n))  we let Sn  (cid:126)K µ be the fraction of 1’s in L(n) independent Bernoulli
random variables with success probabilities (µ([ (cid:126)K(n)]1)  . . .   µ([ (cid:126)K(n)]L(n)))  where for i ≤ L(n) 
[ (cid:126)K(n)]i = Ki is the i-th component of (cid:126)K(n).

Deﬁnition 3. Given a partition function (cid:126)K and a group competence function µ  for any n  we let
Rn( (cid:126)K  µ) denote the probability for majority voting by representatives according to (cid:126)K and µ to be
correct. That is  Rn( (cid:126)K  µ) = P(Sn  (cid:126)K µ > 1
2 ). (We use R( (cid:126)K  µ) when n is clear from the context.)
Deﬁnition 4. A representative democracy with group competence function µ is consistent if there
exists a partition function (cid:126)K(n) for which the majority voting of representatives is correct with
probability 1 as n → ∞  that is  limn→∞ Rn( (cid:126)K  µ) = 1.
Theorem 1. For a voter-competence distribution F   the representative democracy with group
competence function µ is consistent if and only if there exists K∗ ∈ N such that µ(K∗) > 0.5.
Missing proofs are in the full version. We now deﬁne the beneﬁt  cost  and social welfare.
Deﬁnition 5. Let Ben(n) ∈ R be the beneﬁt of making the correct decision and let Cost(L) be cost of
maintaining L representatives. Given a partition (cid:126)K = (K1  . . .   KL(n)) ∈ NL(n)  the social welfare
of (cid:126)K is the expected beneﬁt minus the cost of voting  that is 
SW( (cid:126)K) = Ben(n)Rn( (cid:126)K  µ) − Cost(L) = Ben(n)

3.1 Optimal Group Size for Fixed Cost of Voting

In this section  we focus on a ﬁxed voting cost regardless of the number of representatives. In this case 
the goal is to ﬁnd the optimal partition (cid:126)K that maximizes Rn( (cid:126)K  µ). Let us ﬁrst informally discuss
the effect of increasing the size of groups  which trades quality (competence of each representative)
for quantity (the number of representatives)  and is a form of mean vs. variance tradeoff.
The quality vs. quantity tradeoff. Suppose n is ﬁxed
and we are deciding between group sizes K1 < K2  with
µ(K2) ≥ µ(K1) > 0.5. For simplicity  suppose K1 and
K2 divide n and assume group sizes are equal in both cases 
so (cid:126)K1 = (K1 . . .   K1) and (cid:126)K2 = (K2 . . .   K2). With K1
members in each group  each representative has competence
µ(K1) < µ(K2). On the other hand  the number of repre-
sentatives is L1 = n/K1 > n/K2 = L2. Therefore  we
have E(Sn  (cid:126)K1 µ) = µ(K1) ≤ µ(K2) = E(Sn  (cid:126)K2 µ)  while
the variance of Sn  (cid:126)K2 µ  which is µ(K1)(1 − µ(K1))/L1 
can potentially be smaller than the variance of Sn  (cid:126)K2 µ.2
Therefore  the optimal group size K∗ minimizes the left tail
probability P[S < 0.5]. This mean vs. variance tradeoff is
illustrated using the distribution of S in Figure 1 for the MAX
process with n = 2000 and F = Uniform[0.44  0.55]. We compare three group sizes: K = 2 (low
mean  low variance)  K∗ = 8 (optimal  middle)  and K = 20 (high mean  high variance).
Naturally  our next goal is to identify an optimal number of representatives (groups)  denoted by
L∗(n). We will ﬁrst focus on the speciﬁc partition functions where almost all groups have the same
size  with the exception for the last group  whose size is allowed to be larger than other groups. This
is a natural setting in practice because each representative is supposed to represent equal number of
voters. Later in this section we will show how to extend our study to general partition functions.
Deﬁnition 6 (Homogeneous groups). Given n and a group size K  in the homogeneous setting 
L = (cid:98)n/K(cid:99) representatives are selected using partition function (cid:126)HK = (K  . . .   K  n − (L − 1)K) 
with L − 1 groups of size K.
Our main result is that for homogeneous groups  the optimal group size is bounded by a constant 
provided that some value of K can achieve consistency and the group competence function µ
is polynomially bounded away from 1 as K goes to inﬁnity. Let K∗
hom(n) denote the optimal
homogeneous group size that maximizes SW( (cid:126)HK)  where Cost(L) is a constant. Then  K∗
hom(n)
maximizes Rn( (cid:126)HK∗
hom(n)  µ)  the probability for the majority of representatives to be correct.
Theorem 2 (Optimal homogeneous group size). Suppose the Cost(L) is a constant  there exists
K∗ ∈ N such that µ(K∗) = 1
2   and for all K ∈ N  µ(K) ≤ 1 − A/K α for

The intuition is that as K increases  we experience diminishing returns with respect to µ because µ is
bounded away from 1. On the other hand  there is a loss due to decreasing L = (cid:98) n/K (cid:99)  the number
of representatives. One may expect that the best tradeoff is achieved when K is a slowly increasing
function of n  but our theorem proves otherwise. The proof is technical and involves a subtle analysis
of the tail probabilty P[S < 0.5]  which is deferred to the appendix.
Proof. (Sketch) We may assume the ﬁrst L−1 groups has K members. We ﬁrst observe an elementary
bound that allows us to ignore the last group whose number of representatives is unknown:

We are ready to prove the theorem. Let c be deﬁned as in the statement of the theorem. We may
hom(n) ≤ n ≤ cK∗. Further 
assume n > cK∗ otherwise the theorem automatically holds  because K∗
if L∗ = 1  then there is just one group and any K > K∗ will also have just one group and be
equivalent. Therefore  we may assume L∗ ≥ 2. Now suppose K > cK∗. Deﬁne µK = µ(K)
and LK = (cid:98) n/K (cid:99)  µ∗ = µ(K∗) and L∗ = (cid:98) n/K∗ (cid:99). Observe that LK ≤ L∗. We show that
R(L∗  µ∗) ≥ R(LK  µK) which means that K cannot be better than K∗ for a homogeneous partition

As a corollary  Theorem 2 can be applied to any F with continuous density function  which means
that in such cases the optimal number of representatives with homogeneous group-size is Ω(n).
Corrollary 1 (Linear number of representatives). Suppose F has a continuous density function on
[0  1]. For any µ such that µ(K∗) > 0.5 for some K∗. The optimal number of representatives for
homogeneous groups is at least n

cK∗   where c is the constant deﬁned in Theorem 2.

When costs are ﬁxed  a representative democracy with ﬁxed group size makes better choices than
the representative democracy with ﬁxed number of representatives. One limitation of Theorem 2 is
that it only holds for homogeneous group size. We can drop this restriction if the group competence
function µ(K) is concave (for example the MAX process is concave). Let L∗(n) denote the optimal
number of groups for n voters.
Theorem 3 (Optimal number of representatives for general group sizes). Suppose Cost(L) is a
constant  there exists K∗ ∈ N such that µ(K∗) ≥ 1
2   µ is concave  and

µ(K) ≤ 1 − A/K α for constant A < 1 and α ≥ 0. Then  for any n  L∗(n) ≥(cid:106) n

The proof of Theorem 3 is similar to the proof of Theorem 2. Next  we extend Theorem 3 by
showing that the optimal partitioning function (cid:126)K is nearly homogeneous if µ is log-concave and
1 − µ is log-convex. Log-concavity is weaker than concavity (e.g.  the MAX process is log-concave).
Theorem 4 (Near-Homogeneity of group sizes). Suppose Cost(L) is a constant  the group compe-
tence function µ(K) is log-concave and non-decreasing  and further that 1 − µ(K) is log-convex.
Given L groups  there is an optimal partition (K1  . . .   KL) of n into the L groups with no two
groups differing in size by more than 1. That is  maxi Ki − mini Ki ≤ 1.
Theorem 4 also applies to non-constant cost functions because the number of groups is ﬁxed.

Numerical Example of Optimal Group Size. As an application
of our results  we consider the uniform voters with MAX represen-
tative selection process (Example 2) within a simple setting which
capturea at a very coarse level the US House of Representatives.
We pick a voter distribution F = Uniform[0.45  b] (of course  this
may not capture voters in the US  but it is just illustrative.) Below 
we show how the optimal homogeneous group size K∗ and the
minimum group size required to achieve consistency K∗ depend
on b. When b is small  as voters get wiser (b goes up)  K∗ and
K∗ are decreasing. At some point  even the direct-democracy
(K∗ = 1) is consistent. For very large b  the optimal group size
starts to increase due to the µ(1− µ) term. In general  the optimal
group size is less than about 5  the size of the typical household. The optimal representative democracy
is obtained when each household elects a head to vote on its behalf.
The optimal group size is useful to know  but for practical purposes  there may not be a signiﬁcant
difference between different values of K for a large n. Let us take the US House as an example 
which has 435 representatives. Suppose the voting population is about n = 235 million  and that
voter competence is uniformly distributed from 0.45 to 0.52 (the average competence is slightly less
than 0.5)  which corresponds to b = 0.52 in our example.

In this simple setting  direct democracy (K = 1) would be wrong  and the current size of the House
is far from optimal  20% less accurate than what is achievable. Doubling congress gets you to 88%
and multiplying by 5 pretty much gets you to optimal. A House that is 20 times larger (each member
representing 35K citizen) would be essentially indistinguishable from optimal. This suggests that a
much larger House is needed for noisy issues like the one in this example. Also note that if group
sizes are about 5 (the size of a household) then we have near-perfect results.

3.2 Optimal Group Size for Polynomial Cost of Voting

When there is a non-constant cost to voting  things change dramatically. We consider the case
where the cost and beneﬁt are both polynomial here  though our analysis can be extend to other
functional forms  with different results. Perhaps the most intuitive cost and beneﬁt are both linear
(per-representative cost and per-voter beneﬁt). We simply state the result.
Theorem 5 (Optimal homogeneous group size  polynomial cost and polynomial beneﬁt). Suppose
Cost(L)
Ben(n) = Θ( Lq1
2   µ is
non-decreasing  and for all K ∈ N  µ(K) ≤ 1 − A/K α for constants A > 0 and α ≥ 0. Then  the
optimal group size K∗

nq2 ) for constants q1 > 0 and q2 > 0  there exists K∗ ∈ N such that µ(K∗) > 1

hom(n) = Ω(n/ log n). Moreover  we have:

(i) If limK→∞ µ(K) < 1  then K∗
(ii) If there exists B  β > 0 such that µ(K) ≥ 1 − B/K β  then K∗

hom(n) = Θ(n/ log n).

hom(n) = Θ(n).

4 Summary and Future Work

We set the mathematical foundation for studying the optimal number of representatives in a rep-
resentative democracy and showed that under general and natural conditions  the optimal is linear
when the cost of voting is a constant  and logarithmic when the cost and beneﬁt are both polynomial.
Our results can be extended to multiple issues. There are many open questions: Can we extend
to inhomogeneous representative selection processes  e.g. different states use different processes
to choose representatives? Does diversity (inhomogeneous agents) in population help make better
decisions? What happens if agents are strategic?
