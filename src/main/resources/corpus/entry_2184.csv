Abstract

It has been speculated that the human motion system combines noisy measure-
ments with prior expectations in an optimal  or rational  manner. The basic goal
of our work is to discover experimentally which prior distribution is used. More
speciﬁcally  we seek to infer the functional form of the motion prior from the per-
formance of human subjects on motion estimation tasks. We restricted ourselves
to priors which combine three terms for motion slowness  ﬁrst-order smoothness 
and second-order smoothness. We focused on two functional forms for prior dis-
tributions: L2-norm and L1-norm regularization corresponding to the Gaussian
and Laplace distributions respectively. In our ﬁrst experimental session we esti-
mate the weights of the three terms for each functional form to maximize the ﬁt to
human performance. We then measured human performance for motion tasks and
found that we obtained better ﬁt for the L1-norm (Laplace) than for the L2-norm
(Gaussian). We note that the L1-norm is also a better ﬁt to the statistics of motion
in natural environments. In addition  we found large weights for the second-order
smoothness term  indicating the importance of high-order smoothness compared
to slowness and lower-order smoothness. To validate our results further  we used
the best ﬁt models using the L1-norm to predict human performance in a second
session with different experimental setups. Our results showed excellent agree-
ment between human performance and model prediction – ranging from 3% to
8% for ﬁve human subjects over ten experimental conditions – and give further
support that the human visual system uses an L1-norm (Laplace) prior.

1 Introduction

Imagine that you are traveling in a moving car and observe a walker through a fence full of punch
holes. Your visual system can readily perceive the walking person against the apparently moving
background using only the motion signals visible through these holes. But this task is far from trivial
due to the inherent local ambiguity of motion stimuli  often referred to as the aperture problem. More
precisely  if you view a line segment through an aperture then you can easily estimate the motion
component normal to the line but it is impossible to estimate the tangential component. So there are
an inﬁnite number of possible interpretations of the local motion signal.

One way to overcome this local ambiguity is to integrate local motion measurements across space
to infer the ”true” motion ﬁeld. Physiological studies have shown that direction-selective neurons

1

in primary visual cortex perform local measurements of motion. Then the visual system integrates
these local motion measurements to form global motion perception [4  5]. Psychophysicists have
identiﬁed a variety of phenomena  such as motion capture and motion cooperativity  which appear
to be consequences of motion spatial integration [1  2  3]. From the computational perspective 
a number of Bayesian models have been proposed to explain these effects by hypothesizing prior
assumptions about the motion ﬁelds that occur in natural environments. In particular  it has been
shown that a prior which is biased to slow-and-smooth motion can account for a range of experi-
mental results [6  7  8  9  10].

But although evidence from physiology and psychophysics supports the existence of an integration
stage  it remains unclear exactly what motion priors are used to resolve the measurement ambigui-
ties. In the walking example described above (see ﬁgure 1)  the visual system needs to integrate the
local measurements in the two regions within the red boxes in order to perceive a coherently moving
background. This integration must be performed over large distances  because the regions are widely
separated  but this integration cannot be extended to include the walker region highlighted in the blue
box  because this would interfere with accurate estimation of the walker’s movements. Hence the
motion priors used by the human visual system must have a functional form which enables ﬂexible
and robust integration.

We aim to determine the functional form of the motion priors which underly human perception 
and to validate how well these priors can inﬂuence human perception in various motion tasks. Our
approach is to combine parametric modeling of the motion priors with psychophysical experiments
to estimate the model parameters that provide the best ﬁt to human performance across a range
of stimulus conditions. To provide further validation  we then use the estimated model to predict
human performance in several different experimental setups. In this paper  we ﬁrst introduce the
two functional forms which we consider and review related literature in Section 2. Then in Section
3 we present our computational theory and implementation details. In Section 4 we test the theory
by comparing its predictions with human performance in a range of psychophysical experiments.

Figure 1: Observing a walker with a moving camera. Left panel  two example frames. The visual
system needs to integrate motion measurements from the two regions in the red boxes in order to
perceive the motion of the background. But this integration should not be extended to the walker
region highlighted in the blue box. Right panel  the integration task is made harder by observing the
scene through a set of punch holes. The experimental stimuli in our psychophysical experiments are
designed to mimic these observation conditions.

2 Functional form of motion priors

Many models have proposed that the human visual system uses prior knowledge of probable mo-
tions  but the functional form for this prior remains unclear. For example  several well-established
computational models employ Gaussian priors to encode the bias towards slow and spatially smooth
motion ﬁelds. But the choice of Gaussian distributions has largely been based on computational
convenience [6  8]  because they enable us to derive analytic solutions.

However  some evidence suggests that different distribution forms may be used by the human visual
system. Researchers have used motion sequences in real scenes to measure the spatial and temporal
statistics of motion ﬁelds [11  12]. These natural statistics show that the magnitude of the motion
(speed) falls off in a manner similar to a Laplacian distribution ( L1-norm regularization)  which has
heavier tails than Gaussian distributions (see the left plot in ﬁgure 2). These heavy tails indicates
that while slow motions are very common  fast motions are still occur fairly frequently in natural

2

environments. A similar distribution pattern was also found for spatial derivatives of the motion ﬂow 
showing that non-smooth motion ﬁelds can also happen in natural environments. This statistical
ﬁnding is not surprising since motion discontinuities can arise in the natural environment due to the
relative motion of objects  foreground/background segmentation  and occlusion.

Stocker and Simoncelli [10] conducted a pioneering study to infer the functional form of the slow-
ness motion prior. More speciﬁcally  they used human subject responses in a speed discrimination
task to infer the shape of the slowness prior distribution. Their inferred slowness prior showed sig-
niﬁcantly heavier tails than a Gaussian distribution. They showed that a motion model using this
inferred prior provided an adequate ﬁt to human data for a wide range of stimuli.

Finally  the robustness of the L1-norm has also been demonstrated in many statistical applications
(e.g.  regression and feature selection). In the simplest case of linear regression  suppose we want
to ﬁnd the intercept with the constraint of zero slope. The regression with L1-norm regularization
estimates the intercept based on the sample median  whereas the L2-norm regression estimates the
intercept based on the sample mean. A single outlier has very little effect on the median but can
alter the mean signiﬁcantly. Accordingly  the L1-norm regularization is less sensitive to outliers
than is the L2-norm. We illustrate this for motion estimation by the example in the right panel
of ﬁgure 2. If there is a motion boundary in the true motion ﬁeld  then a model using L2-norm
regularization (Gaussian priors) tends to impose strong smoothing over the two distinct motion
ﬁelds which blurs the motion across discontinuity. But the model with an L1-norm (Laplace prior)
preserves the motion discontinuity and gives smooth motion ﬂow on both sides of it.

priors.

3 Mathematical Model

The input data is speciﬁed by local motion measurements ~rq  of form ~uq = (u1q  u2q)  at a discrete
set of positions ~rq  q = 1  ...  N in the image plane. The goal is to ﬁnd a smooth motion ﬁeld
~v deﬁned at all positions ~r in the image domain  estimated from the local motion measurements.
The motion ﬁeld ~v can be thought of as an interpolation of the data which obeys a slowness and
smoothness prior and which agrees approximately with the local motion measurements. Recall that
the visual system can only observe the local motion in the directions ~nq = ~uq
|~uq| (sometimes called
component motion) because of the aperture problem. Hence approximate agreement with local
measurements reduces to the constraints:

~v(~rq) · ~nq − ~uq · ~nq ≈ 0.

As illustrated in ﬁgure 3  we consider three motion prior terms which quantify the preference for
slowness  ﬁrst-order smoothness and second-order smoothness respectively. Let Ω denote the image
domain – i.e. the set of points ~r = (r1  r2) ∈ Ω. We deﬁne the prior to be a Gibbs distribution with
energy function of form:

The combined energy function to be minimized is:

This energy is a convex function provided the exponents satisfy α  β  γ  p ≥ 1. Therefore the energy
minimum can be found by imposing the ﬁrst order optimality conditions  ∂F (~v)
∂~v = 0 (the Euler-
Lagrange equations). Below we computer these Euler-Lagrange partial differential equations in
~v = (v1  v2). We ﬁx the likelihood term by setting p = 2 (the exponent of the likelihood term). If
α  β  γ 6= 2  the Euler-Lagrange equations are non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) and
explicit solutions cannot be found (if α  β  γ = 2 the Euler-Lagrange equations will be linear and so
can be solved by Fourier transforms or Green’s functions  as previously done in [6]). To solve these
non-linear PDEs we discretize them by ﬁnite differences and use iterative gradient descent (i.e. we
apply the dynamics ∂~v(~r t)
∂~v(~r t) until we reach a ﬁxed state). More precisely  we initialize
~v(~r  0) at random  and solve the update equation for t > 0:

∂t = − ∂F (~v(~r t))

nk qδ~r ~rq  

where k = 1  2  δ~r ~rq = 1 if ~r = ~rq and δ~r ~rq = 0 if ~r 6= ~rq. Since the powers α − 2  β −
2  γ − 2 become negative when the positive exponents α  β  ... take value 1  we include a small
 = 10−6 inside the square roots to avoid division by zero (when calculating terms like |.|). The
algorithm stops when the difference between two consecutive energy estimates is close to zero (i.e.
the stopping criterion is based on thresholding the energy change).

Our implementation discretized the Euler-Lagrange equations  as speciﬁed below. Let ~B(l) =
|∇~v(l)|β−2  ~C(l) = |4~v(l)|γ−2  ~A(l) = |~v(l)|α−2  where l denotes time discretization with 4t
the time-step  and (i  j) denotes space discretization with h = 4r1 = 4r2 being the space-step.

4 Experiments

We compared two possible functional forms for the motion prior: (1) the Laplace distribution with
L1-norm regularization  with α = β = γ = 1  (2) the Gaussian distribution with L2-norm regular-
ization  with α = β = γ = 2. Since the main goal of this work is to discover motion priors  we
employed the same likelihood term with p = 2 for both models. We used the performance of human
subjects in the ﬁrst experimental session to estimate the weights of the three prior terms  λ  µ  η 
for each functional form. We then validated the predictions of the model by comparing them with
human performance in a second experimental session which uses different stimulus parameters.

4.1 Stimulus

We used a multiple-aperture stimulus [13] which consists of 12 by 12 drifting sine-wave gratings
within a square window subtending 8◦. Each element (0.5◦) was composed of an oriented sinusoidal
grating of 5.6 cycles/deg spatial frequency  which was within a stationary Gaussian window. The
contrast of the elements was 0.2. The motion stimulus included 20 time frames which were presented
within 267 ms. The global motion stimulus was generated as follows. First  the orientation of each
local grating element was randomly determined. Second  a global motion (also called 2D motion 
with the speed of 1 deg/sec) direction was chosen. Third  a certain proportion of elements (signal
elements) were assigned with the predetermined 2D motion   while each of the remaining elements
(noise elements) was assigned a random 2D motion. Finally  with its orientation and 2D motion
velocity  the drifting speed for each element was computed so that the local (or component) drifting
velocity was consistent with the assigned 2D motion velocity. As shown in ﬁgure 4 the global
motion strength was controlled by varying the proportion of signal elements in the stimulus (i.e.  the

5

coherence ratio). Stimuli with high ratio exhibited more coherent motion  and stimuli with low ratio
exhibited more random motion.

In all the experiments reported in this paper  each participant completed two experiment sessions
with different stimulus parameters. The goal of session 1 was parameter estimation: to estimate the
weights of the three prior terms – slowness  ﬁrst-order smoothness and second-order smoothness  –
for each model. Session 2 was for model validation: using the weights estimated from session 1 to
predict subject performance for different experimental conditions.

and noise elements  respectively.

4.2 Experiment 1

4.2.1 Procedure

There were two separate sessions in Experiment 1. On each trial of the ﬁrst session  observers
were presented with two motion patterns  one after another. The ﬁrst one was the reference motion
pattern  which always moved upward (0 degree)  and the second one was the test motion pattern 
whose global motion direction was either tilted towards the left or the right relative to the reference
pattern. Both patterns lasted for 267 ms with 500 ms inter-stimulus interval. The observer’s task
was to determine whether the global motion direction of the test pattern was more towards the left
or right relative to the reference pattern. In order to make sure observers understood the task and
were able to perceive the global motion  before the beginning of the ﬁrst session  observers passed a
test session in which they achieved 90% accuracy in 40 consecutive trials with 80% coherence and
20 (or 45) degrees of angular difference. To allow observers to familiarize themselves with the task 
before each experimental session observers went through a practice session with 10 blocks of 25
trials.

The ﬁrst session consisted of 20 blocks of 50 trials. the coherence ratio was constant within each
block. The observer’s discrimination performance was measured for ten coherence ratios (0  0.1 
0.2  ..  0.9) in the ﬁrst session. The angular difference between the reference and test motion was
ﬁxed for each observer in the entire session (2 degrees for observers AL  MW and AE; 45 degrees
for OQ and CC). The second session was identical to the ﬁrst one  except that the coherence ratio
was ﬁxed at 0.7  and the angular difference between the global motion directions of the reference
and the test patterns was varied across blocks (ten angular differences: 1  5  10  ..  45 degrees).

4.2.2 Results

We implemented motion models with the Laplace prior distribution (termed ”L1 model”) and the
Gaussian prior (termed ”L2 model”). As the ﬁrst step  exhaustive search was conducted to ﬁnd a
set of weights for the prior terms that provided the best ﬁt to the human psychometric performance
in experimental session 1. Table 1 reports the estimated parameters for each individual subject us-
ing the L1 and L2 models. There was clear individual difference for the estimated weight values.
However  across all ﬁve subjects  large weight values were found for the second-order smoothness
terms  indicating the contribution from higher-order smoothness preference is important in perceiv-
ing global motion from multiple-aperture stimulus.

Figure 5 shows the results from each individual participant and best-ﬁtting model performance. The
results clearly show the L1 model provided the better ﬁt to human data when compared to the L2
model. In general humans appear to be sensitive to the inclusion of noise elements  and perform

worse than the L2 model  which tends to strongly encourage smoothness over the entire display
window.

In experimental session 2  the two models predicted performance as a function of angular difference
between the reference motion and the test motion. As shown in ﬁgure 7  the L1 model yielded less
error in ﬁtting human performance than did the L2 model. This result illustrates the power of the L1
model in predicting human performance in motion tasks different from the tasks used for estimating
model parameters.

(L2 model). In Experiment 2  we compared human motion judgment with predictions of the L1
model on each trial  rather than using the average performance as in Experiment 1. Such a detailed
comparison can provide quantitative measures of how well the L1 model is able to predict human
motion judgment for speciﬁc stimuli.

In Experiment 2  the ﬁrst session was identical to that in Experiment 1  in which angular difference
in the two global motion directions were ﬁxed (45 degrees for all observers) while the coherence
ratio was varied. In the second session  observers were presented with one motion stimulus on each
trial. The global motion direction of the pattern was randomly selected from 24 possible directions
(with a 15-degree difference between two adjacent directions). Observers reported their perceived
global motion directions by rotating a line after the motion stimulus disappeared from the screen.
The experiment included 12 blocks (each with 48 trials) and six coherence ratios (0  0.1  0.3  ..  0.9).
A two-pass design was used to let each observer run the identical session twice in order to measure
the reliability of the observer’s judgments.

We used human performance in session 1 to estimate model parameters: weights λ  µ  η for slow-
ness  ﬁrst-order smoothness and second-order smoothness prior terms for each individual partici-
pant. Since identical stimuli were used in the two runs of session 2  we can quantify the reliability
of the observer’s judgment by computing the response correlation across trials in these two runs. As
shown in the left plot of ﬁgure 7  human observers’ responses were signiﬁcantly correlated in the
two runs  even in the condition of random motion (coherence ratio is close to 0). The correlated
responses in these subthreshold conditions suggest that human observers are able to provide con-
sistent interpretation of motion ﬂow  even when the motion is random. The right plot of ﬁgure 7
shows the trial-by-trial correlation between human motion judgments with model-predicted global
motion direction. The model-human correlations were comparable to human self-correlations. Even
in the random motion condition (where the coherence ratio is 0)  the correlation between the model
and human judgments is greater than 0.5  indicating the predictive power of the model. We also
noticed that the correlation between human and L2 model was around 8 percent worse than the hu-
man self-correlation and the correlation between the L1 model and humans. This ﬁnding further
demonstrated that the L1 model provided a better ﬁt to human data than did the L2 model.

lation. Left plot  human self correlation between two runs of identical experimental sessions. Right
plot  correlation between human motion judgement and model predicted global motion direction.
The signiﬁcant correlation between human and the model indicates the L1 model is able to predict
human motion judgment for speciﬁc stimuli  even in the random display  i.e.  coherence ratio close
to 0.
5 Conclusions

We found that a motion prior in the form of the Laplace distribution with L1-norm regularization
provided signiﬁcantly better agreement with human performance than did Gaussian priors with L2-
norm. We also showed that humans weighted second-order motion smoothness much higher than
ﬁrst-order smoothness and slowness. Furthermore  model predictions using this Laplace prior were
consistent with human perception of coherent motion  even for random displays. Overall our results
suggest that human motion perception for these types of stimuli can be well modeled using Laplace
priors.
