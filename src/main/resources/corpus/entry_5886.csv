Abstract

Most adversarial learning based video prediction methods suffer from image blur 
since the commonly used adversarial and regression loss pair work rather in a
competitive way than collaboration  yielding compromised blur effect. In the
meantime  as often relying on a single-pass architecture  the predictor is inadequate
to explicitly capture the forthcoming uncertainty. Our work involves two key
insights: (1) Video prediction can be approached as a stochastic process: we sample
a collection of proposals conforming to possible frame distribution at following time
stamp  and one can select the ﬁnal prediction from it. (2) De-coupling combined
loss functions into dedicatedly designed sub-networks encourages them to work
in a collaborative way. Combining above two insights we propose a two-stage
framework called VPSS (Video Prediction via Selective Sampling). Speciﬁcally a
Sampling module produces a collection of high quality proposals  facilitated by a
multiple choice adversarial learning scheme  yielding diverse frame proposal set.
Subsequently a Selection module selects high possibility candidates from proposals
and combines them to produce ﬁnal prediction. Extensive experiments on diverse
challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed video prediction
approach  i.e.  yielding more diverse proposals and accurate prediction results.

Introduction

Video prediction has been receiving increasing research attention in computer vision [3  29  10  8  19] 
which has great potentials in applications such as future decision  robot manipulation and autonomous
driving [20]. Previous methods [10  19] with pixel-wise regression loss tend to produce blurry
results as they seek the average from possible futures [29]. To enhance the generation quality  some
works [8  34] utilize adversarial learning [13] to facilitate video prediction task  i.e.  adding an
adversarial loss [13] on the prediction module.
However  paired regression and adversarial loss still CANNOT solve image blur and motion defor-
mation problems in principle. A generator often struggles to balance between adversarial [13] and
regression loss during training procedure [18  2  5]  thus most possibly yielding an averaged result.
As in worse case either adversarial [13] or regression loss tend to take dominate place  which forces
the other term to fail to play its role. In other words  both loss functions work rather in a competitive
way than collaboration. We start to think: (1) To address the blur issue  is it possible to sample
a collection of high quality proposals conforming to possible frame distribution at following time
stamp  and select the ﬁnal prediction from it? (2) To encourage collaboration between loss functions 
is it possible to design dedicated sub-networks for adversarial and regression loss respectively?

Motivated by these issues  we propose a two-stage framework called VPSS which utilizes different
modules to handle both losses respectively  therefore to encourage collaboration between them 
instead of competition. As shown in Figure 1  the Sampling module produces multiple high quality
video frame proposals  by making use of a multiple choice adversarial learning scheme  yielding
diverse video prediction set. This module is trained in an adversarial learning manner [5]. The
Selection module selects high possibility candidates from proposals and combines to produce the
ﬁnal prediction  according to the criteria of better position matching. By contrast  the selection
module is trained with regression loss. We conduct both qualitative and quantitative experiments on
diverse datasets  ranging from digits moving  human motion to robotic arm manipulation  including a
visualization experiment. Our results clearly indicate higher visual quality and more precise motion
prediction  even for complex motion patterns as well as long-term prediction  which signiﬁcantly
outperform prior arts. Experiments show that these two modules could corporate well with each other
under the VPSS framework.

2 Related work
Video Prediction. Many previous work have been done on video prediction task. Srivastava
et al. [33] ﬁrst proposes to use LSTM [16] to predict future frames. Shi et al. [32] proposes
ConvLSTM architecture dedicated to preserve the spatial information  which is a big step forward
on this task. Different from ConvLSTM  DFN [19] generates convolution kernels according to the
inputs  which shows more ﬂexibility on modelling the motion variation. CDNA [10] combines
the advantages of ConvLSTM [32] and DFN [19] for further utilizing the spatial information.
However all above methods suffer from the image blur and structure deformation because of the
regression loss. To enhance the image quality  DrNet [8] and MCNet [34] utilize adversarial training
to generate more sharpen frames  yet hard to balance adversarial loss and regression loss. Some
work [35  20  31] further push prediction model to achieve long-term prediction. More recently 
stochastic prediction [7  3  25] tries to use random learned prior or noise to achieve prediction in a
stochastic way  which generate visually appealing prediction but with stochastic motion prediction
(i.e.  location variation and shape transformation is random). Note that different from these stochastic
prediction methods  our model ﬁrst generates multiple proposals and then precisely infer the ﬁnal
outcome from them  which shows high precision motion prediction.
Competition between Adversarial and Regression Loss. This issue has been widely discussed
in image generation and translation task [18  36]. It is more commonly treated as the competition
between generation diversity (i.e.  related to GAN [13] loss) and visual quality (i.e.  related to
regression loss) in image domain. VAE-GAN [24] ﬁrst proposes to combine VAE and GAN [13] by
replacing element-wise errors with feature-wise errors to better capture the data distribution. Some
work try to solve this problem from information entropy view  such as InfoGAN [6]  ALI [9] and
ALICE [26]  which mainly try to ﬁnd a deterministic mapping relation between the image domain and
latent code domain. Based on VAE-GAN [24]  BEGAN [4] proposes a new equilibrium enforcing
method to pursue fast and stable training and high visual quality. Different from the image generation
task  video prediction further requires precise motion prediction along the time axis. Accordingly  the
competition in video domain lies between visual quality and motion prediction precision  yet few
methods have been proposed to address this issue.

3 Method
Previous models [34  34  25] try to balance adversarial [13] loss (denoted as LAdv) and regression
loss (denoted as LReg) with a hyper-parameter λ  i.e. λLAdv +LReg. To demonstrate the competition
intuitively  we run three open-source codes with their default training setups2  only altering λ with

Figure 1: The general framework of VPSS. At the Sampling stage  our framework contains a
conditional sampling module which produces N high-quality proposals at time stamp t + 1 based on
inputs at time stamp t. For the Selection stage  we propose a selection module for ﬁnal prediction.
This module further chooses K candidates from the high-quality proposals and fuses them to produce
ﬁnal prediction.

different values. As shown in Table 1  if enlarging λ progressively  one can notice that converge value
of LReg keeps increasing. This indicates that it is impractical to force prediction module to satisfy
both sides  which directly motivates us to explore this task from a different view. Speciﬁcally  we
propose a novel framework called VPSS with two modules of sampling and selection. In this section
we discuss this framework and detailed architecture of both modules. Meanwhile we demonstrate
how these two modules effectively corporate well with each other.

3.1 Sampling Module

Previous methods [25  3] aim to model future uncertainty with temporal correlated noise  which is
sampled from prior distribution then passed through a recurrent neural network (e.g.  GRU  LSTM).
However it is insufﬁcient to model the upcoming uncertainty explicitly with random noise based
stochasticity  which lacks correlation with inputs. Inspired by previous work [30  5]  we show that
video prediction can be approached as a stochastic process: we gather a random collection of high
quality proposals in one shot  with a multiple choice adversarial learning scheme that encourages
diversity within the collection.
More formally  consider single step forward prediction  where we use current input (denoted as
xt ∈ RL×H×C) to predict next time-stamp frame (denoted as xt+1 ∈ RL×H×C). L  H  C stand
for image width  height and channel respectively. Recall that xt is ﬁrstly fed into a sampler φspl
to produce a collection of proposals (denoted as ˆXt+1 = {ˆx1
t+1})  where N is the desired
number of proposals. For single prediction the number of ﬁnal output channels in φspl is C. So for
N proposals we directly enlarge it to C × N  where each consecutive C-tuple of channels forms a
proposal  and denote the corresponding kernel as W = {W i}N
To guarantee the visual quality of proposals  we utilize adversarial learning to facilitate the sampling
procedure:

t+1  ...  ˆxN

i=1.

where D is a discriminator capable of distinguishing sampled images from real images. Naturally
we hope these proposals are diverse enough for further selection. However only using the same
adversarial loss forces all proposals to be identical  which departs from the requirement of diversity.
To this end  we propose a kernel generator φKGen to achieve this goal.
At time stamp t  the kernel generator takes previous xt  and xt−1 as input  and the output of φKGen
is ∆W = {∆W i}N
i=1. As shown in Figure 1 (black dash lines)  there is one-to-one correspondence
between ∆W i and ˆxi
t+1. We denote the m-th input channel and n-th output channel of ∆W as

∆W (m  n). Similarly x(n) represents the n-th channel of x and ∆W (·  n) represents the n-th
output channel along with all input channels of ∆W . As shown in Figure 2  the kernel generation
procedure ﬁrst performs channel-wise subtraction to obtain temporal variation information  and then
encodes it into the current convolution kernel with a CNN φW   Meanwhile we perform channel-wise
softmax [28] along the input channel:

∆ ˆW (m  n) = φW (xt(m)  xt−1(n))  m  n = 1  ...  C 

(2)

∆W (·  n) = Sof tmax(∆ ˆW (·  n))  n = 1  ...  C 

(3)
where C is the number of channels. The sampling procedure at time stamp t is executed as follows 
(4)
Through kernel generator we actually transform this problem into kernel diversity  i.e.  diversity
of {∆W i}N
i=1. Inspired from Guzman-Rivera et al. [14]  we develop a multiple choice adversarial
learning scheme as follows 

t+1 = φspl(xt; W i + ∆W i) 

∆W = φKGen(xt  xt−1)  ˆxi

(5)

This loss function is a critical component in sampling module  and the diversity essentially results
from the min operation in Equation 5. To be speciﬁc  at each time stamp we only update kernel
corresponding to the best sampled image  where N kernels ({∆W i}N
i=1) are optimized independently
toward different directions throughout training procedure. This asynchronized updating scheme
encourages the kernel generator to spread its bets and cover the exploration space of predictions
that conform to all possible frame distribution. Intuitively one can consider that the kernel generator
φKGen is boosted to capture motion information based on previous inputs and infer next time-stamp
motion direction without constrain of regression loss. Meanwhile image quality is well guaranteed by
adversarial learning loss (Equation 1). More importantly  different from those stochastic prediction
methods [3  7  25] whose diversity is achieved by random noise  the diversity of our model is entirely
achieved by previous inputs  which is more rational in principle and inherently useful for further
selection.

3.2 Selection Module

Given sampled proposals ˆXt+1  the selection module ﬁrst selects best K candidates from them
under the measure of motion precision. For example  the motion direction usually changes smoothly
between frames  which can be treated as a selection criterion. But it is impractical to hand-crafted
design several criteria for candidate sifting. Meanwhile under the problem setting of video prediction 
ground truth at time stamp t + 1 is unknown at time stamp t. Directly comparing with ground truth
is not an option. To tackle this problem  we formulate it as ranking all proposals based on previous
inputs. To be speciﬁc  for each proposal we utilize recurrent neural network to regress conﬁdence
score obtained in a self-supervised manner  and rank them based on the regressed values. The top-K
candidates are feed into a combiner for further processing.
For clarity we denote the ground-truth score for i-th candidate as γi  and Γ = {γi}N
regressed score is denoted as ˆγi  and ˆΓ = {ˆγi}N

is to calculate the pixel-wise error between the proposals and ground truth: γi = ||xt+1 − ˆxi
works well when the motion pattern is simple (e.g.  transformation toward some direction) and the
objects are rigid bodies. When encountering real-world video sequences (e.g.  human or robot motion
with occlusion)  it severely suffers from the motion uncertainty and complex structure deformation.
For better capturing the motion and content information  we utilize a pre-trained discriminative model
to extract the multi-level feature from video sequences  and compute the conﬁdence score at feature
level  which is widely used in image translation task [18]:

γi =

where ϕ is the discriminative model (e.g.  detection or pose estimation network)  and l stands for the
l-th layer of ϕ. As mentioned above  Γ is treated as target value of conﬁdence score. Based on it we
can predict the conﬁdence score based on previous inputs as follows:

i = 1  ...  N 

ˆγi = ψslt(ˆxi

(7)
where ψslt is essentially a 3-step ConvLSTM network [32] (Left-most part in Figure 3). It successively

j=1 for ﬁnal prediction 
where T (ˆΓ) is the index set of top-K candidates in ˆΓ.
For the ﬁnal step  we utilize a Combiner ψcomb to compose candidates ˜X into ﬁnal prediction.
Correspondingly it requires ψcomb to fully capture information contained in ˜X. Inspired from
recent work on video analogy making [31]  we propose a K-stream Auto-Encoder to capture feature
information. As shown in Figure 3  each candidate is fed into an encoder to extract multi-level
information  then passed to decoder to generate K masks M = {mj}K
j=1  which are used to compose
K candidates into ﬁnal prediction:

˜xt+1 = ψcomb( ˜X) = Conv(

where (cid:12) represents hadamard product. As shown in Figure 3  we also use skip connection [18]
between encoders and decoder to enhance feature sharing  and we keep the spatial resolution of feature
same to images throughout ψcomb  which proves more efﬁcient to preserve the spatial information [21].

We use regular regression loss to train ψcomb as follows : Lcomb =(cid:80)T

3.3 Design Considerations and Implementation Details

Design Considerations. Notably  our framework contains two modules and each involves two
sub-networks. If without carefully designed training procedure  it will easily get stuck in a bad local
minima with meaningless outputs. We therefore provide several practical considerations dedicated for
training stability. Firstly  sampler φspl and selector ψslt act as models with strong prior knowledge 
pre-training them stabilizes following training procedure by a large margin. Secondly  we utilize
curriculum learning [22] along the temporal direction  which could effectively ﬂatten the training
curve. Last but not least  we decouple combined loss function into corresponding sub-networks 
i.e.  we update φKGen  φspl  ψslt  ψcomb according to LKGen Lspl Lslt Lcomb respectively. On one

hand  this design scheme prevents competition between adversarial and regression losses in principle.
Because the gradients back-propagated from them are to optimize different networks  which gets
rid of balancing between these two loss functions. On the other hand  sub-networks are designed
dedicated for different objectives  e.g.  the sampler is required to produce high quality proposals
without requirement of motion accuracy  while the selector should be able to fully capture the motion
information of previous inputs and select out proposals with high motion accuracy. Note that these
objectives are complementary with each other  which essentially encourages corporation between
different sub-networks.
Implementation Details. We implement the proposed framework with Tensorﬂow library [1]. The
sampler consists of 3 down-sampling Res-Blocks [15] and 3 up-sampling Res-Blocks  where sampling
operation is bilinear interpolation with stride 2. Each block is followed by ReLU [12] activation. The
kernel generator consists of 5 convolution layers with leaky-ReLU [27] (Leaky rate 0.1) and ﬁnal
layer with sigmoid. The selector is a 3-layer ConvLSTM [32] with stride 4. Finally the combiner
consists of two parts  i.e.  the encoder and decoder. Encoder part is a 4-layer convolution network with
down-sampling of stride 2. The decoder is a mirrored version of the encoder with 4 deconvolution
layers and a sigmoid output layer. The model ϕ is identical to that used in style transfer [11]. As
mentioned above  we pre-train φspl and ψslt for 2 epochs. The curriculum learning is essentially
increasing the prediction length by 1 every epoch with initial length of 1. In all experiments we train
all our models with the ADAM optimizer [23] and learning rate η = 0.0001  β1 = 0.5  β2 = 0.999.
In all experiments we set N = 5 and K = 2. This selection will be further discussed in Section 4.4.
4 Experiments

4.1 Datasets and Evaluation Setup

Datasets. We evaluate our framework (VPSS) on three diverse datasets: MovingMnist [33]  Robot-
Push [10] and Human3.6M [17]  which represent challenges in different aspects. MovingMnist [33]
contains one bouncing digit  which is treated as toy example and suitable for demonstrating the
superiority of our framework. RobotPush [10] involves complex robotic motion which has been
widely used for video prediction. Human3.6M [17] captures single human motion whose challenge
lies in motion stochasticity. Notably  in Human3.6M [17] the human subject only takes a small
portion of current frame  whose motion could easily be ignored only with the regression loss.
Evaluation Setup. A long-standing issue in video prediction or generation task is how to ensure
fair comparison with other models [25]. We try to get rid of unfair comparison by taking following
two measures: (1) we compare our model with models whose source codes can be accessed  (2)
we exactly follow their experiment setup and do not change their training procedure. For detailed
evaluation setup  please refer to Table 2.
4.2 Quantitative Evaluation

To quantitatively evaluate our proposed framework  we compute the PSNR and SSIM value for
DFN [19]  SVG [7] and our model on MovingMnist Datasets [33]. Due to the stochastic prediction of
SVG [7]  we plot these two curves on average 20 samples for it. Note that different from predicting
10 frames during training  we predict 20 frames to validate the generalization ability. As illustrated

in Figrue 4.4 (left and middle)  our model outperforms the other two by a large margin  especially
in latter time stamps. DFN [19] is trained only under regression loss  without modelling the future
uncertainty. The prediction results degenerate to blurry frames rapidly. SVG [7] models the future
with random noise sampled from a learned prior  which effectively prevents the blur effects. However
the correlation between random noise and current inputs is quite weak  which is insufﬁcient to predict
the future precisely. In other words  it is more like "random guess". So predictions of SVG [7] are
commonly of high image quality but low prediction precision. By contrast within proposed framework
both objectives degrade more gracefully than SVG [7] and DFN [19]. Our framework ﬁrst samples
high quality proposals then combines them into ﬁnal prediction  which effectively tackles above
two problems. It clearly proves that the two-stage framework with dedicated designed sub-networks
uniﬁes both adversarial and regression loss functions into prediction system successfully.
Recently several works [29  8  25] argue that PSNR and SSIM are not convincing enough to guarantee
the quality of video prediction. To this end  we compute the Inception Score for CDNA [10]  SV2P [3]
and our model on RobotPush Datasets [10]. As shown in Figure 4.4 (right)  compared to CDNA [10]
and SV2P [3] our model keeps relative higher scores throughout the prediction procedure  which
mainly beneﬁts from high quality proposals during the sampling stage. The results of CDNA [10] and
SV2P [3] clearly demonstrates that balance between loss functions is hard to satisfy all requirements.
4.3 Qualitative Evaluation
In video prediction task  the most convincing way to demonstrate effectiveness of model is directly
visualizing predicted results. We present several samples predicting up to 20 time stamps for all three
datasets shown in Figure 5. As mentioned above  image blur and prediction accuracy are still two
key issues we care about. We can clearly observe that DFN [19] and CDNA [10] produce blurry
results because of regression loss. While for SVG [7] and SV2P [3]  image quality is much better 
but compared to ground truth  the prediction accuracy is not so satisfying (e.g.  location prediction in
MovingMnist [33]). For MCNet [34] and DrNet [8]  although they try to enhance the image quality
with adversarial learning  the conﬂict between adversarial loss and regression loss prevents them
from achieving both requirements concurrently. By contrast  the proposed two-stage framework
achieves both high image quality and precise motion prediction. We further consider that still
images are not sufﬁcient to fully demonstrate information contained in video sequences  so we
strongly recommend readers to refer to video results in supplemental material.
Meanwhile we provide a subjective experiment for further validation. To be speciﬁc  we collect 1270
prediction results of each dataset  and ask 40 people to provide subjective assessment on them. This
experiment is conducted in three aspects: (1) Regarding the real video samples as baseline  which one
is more realistic (Not based on previous inputs)? (2) Considering image quality and previous inputs 
which one is more similar to the Ground Truth? (3) Considering motion accuracy and previous inputs 
which one is more similar to the Ground Truth? These results are shown in Table 3. In the reality
experiment  we observe that results produced by stochastic prediction (SVG [7]) and adversarial
learning (Ours and MCNet [34]) related methods seem more realistic to human  which demonstrates

effectiveness on enhancing the image quality. Similar effect can be observed even based on previous
inputs (Image quality experiment). For the motion accuracy experiment  one can notice considerable
preference drop of SVG [7]  MCNet [34] and DrNet [8] compared to image quality experiment.
Notably  our framework achieves most of the highest scores in three experiments  which mainly
beneﬁts from proposed selective sampling framework.

4.4 Discussion

Previous experiments demonstrate the superiority of proposed framework. In this section we present
further analysis about it. We ﬁrstly discuss the selection of N and K  then delve deeper into the
execution procedure of our framework.
Selection of N and K. As shown in Table 4  we evaluate the choice of N and K in term of PSNR
and Inception Score [10] on Human3.6M Datasets [17]. One can notice that with the increasing of
K  the prediction accuracy keeps growing (i.e.  higher PSNR value). While with the increasing of N 
the image quality seems to be better (i.e.  higher inception score). But keeping N and K too high
will drastically increase the model complexity. We choose N = 5 and K = 2 for the reason that this
combination could achieve promising performance and keep model at a relative low complexity level.
Are these proposals rational enough? To examine the rationality of proposals at sampling stage 
we plot all these proposals in single image for visualization on MovingMnist Datasets [33]. As shown
in the second row of Figure 5 (B)  the operation of sampler is actually sampling N examples based on
previous inputs  and motion direction of all proposals is roughly towards the ground truth. Meanwhile
one can observe that the image quality of all proposals keeps at a relative high level and almost does
not degrade along the prediction procedure.
Are these candidates accurate enough? To examine the accuracy of candidates at selection stage 
same as above we plot all these candidates for visualization. As shown in the third row of Figure 5 (B) 
the operation of selector is actually selecting K candidates from N proposals. For MovingMnist [33]
prediction  the selector is actually ﬁltering out these proposals which are possibly far away from
the Ground truth. With the help of combiner  high-quality candidates are composed into the ﬁnal
prediction which demonstrates high motion accuracy.

Explanation on ∆W : (1) W is the normal learnable kernel and ∆W is generated at each time stamp.
“Element-wise addition” means matrix addition between ∆Wi and Wi. (2) We update ∆Wi instead
of Wi for the reason that Wi is treated as a basic kernel which estimates motion at a coarse level 
and ∆Wi is for ﬁne-grained prediction based on Wi. By updating ∆Wi we could narrow down the
possible distribution to more precise and smaller scale. (3) Inspired from DFN [9]  we use softmax to
encourage sparsity of ∆Wi  thus we can mimic the complex motion dynamics more precisely. (4)
We present visual evidence (Fig 6(F)) to show the difference among {∆Wi}2
i=0 (2nd input and 2nd
output channel of {∆Wi}2
i=0 on up-right corner of each proposal). They also gradually change along
with time increasing.
Comparison Experiments: As suggested we compare our model with all 6 baselines on Human3.6M
datasets [17] in terms of PSNR  SSIM and Inception Score (Fig 6(A B C)). Our model (green line)
still performs better than these baselines in both terms of motion accuracy and image quality when
prediction length is extended to 30 (Long-term prediction  trained for 10 steps). Particularly it is
slightly better than the baseline SVG/best (best of 10 random samples  light purple line).
Ablation Study: (1) As shown in Fig 6(A B)  when removing selector (K=N) or combiner (K=1) 
the prediction accuracy drops by a large margin (yellow and orange line) compared to the full model
(green line). (2) The predicted results (Fig 6(D)) without selector (2nd row) tend to involve random
motion. By contrast  the conﬁdence score (3rd row) assigned by selector could well estimate the
distribution of future motion  where selector acts as a strong supervisor for motion prediction.
(3) The masks from combiner (Fig 6(E)) actually combine different parts of candidates for ﬁnal
prediction  which help to reﬁne the predicted motion and improve accuracy. (4) Analysis on N and
K: Further increasing K involves proposals with low conﬁdence  which may potentially decrease the
prediction accuracy. Keeping N high will improve performance a little but drastically increase the
model complexity.

5 Conclusion
In this paper we propose a two-stage framework  called VPSS to study video prediction task from a
novel view. At the sampling stage  our framework contains a conditional sampling module which
produces multiple high-quality proposals at time each stamp. For the selection stage  we propose
a selection module for ﬁnal prediction. Extensive experiments on diverse challenging datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed video prediction framework.
