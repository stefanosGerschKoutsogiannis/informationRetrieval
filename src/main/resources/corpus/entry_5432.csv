Abstract

Sudderth  Wainwright  and Willsky conjectured that the Bethe approximation cor-
responding to any ﬁxed point of the belief propagation algorithm over an attrac-
tive  pairwise binary graphical model provides a lower bound on the true partition
function. In this work  we resolve this conjecture in the afﬁrmative by demonstrat-
ing that  for any graphical model with binary variables whose potential functions
(not necessarily pairwise) are all log-supermodular  the Bethe partition function
always lower bounds the true partition function. The proof of this result follows
from a new variant of the “four functions” theorem that may be of independent
interest.

Introduction

Graphical models have proven to be a useful tool for performing approximate inference in a wide va-
riety of application areas including computer vision  combinatorial optimization  statistical physics 
and wireless networking. Computing the partition function of a given graphical model  a typical in-
ference problem  is an NP-hard problem in general. Because of this  the inference problem is often
replaced by a variational approximation that is  hopefully  easier to solve. The Bethe approximation 
one such standard approximation  is of great interest both because of its practical performance and
because of its relationship to the belief propagation (BP) algorithm: stationary points of the Bethe
free energy function correspond to ﬁxed points of belief propagation [1]. However  the Bethe parti-
tion function is only an approximation to the true partition function and need not provide an upper
or lower bound.
In certain special cases  the Bethe approximation is conjectured to provide a lower bound on the true
partition function. One such example is the class of attractive pairwise graphical models: models in
which the interaction between any two neighboring variables places a greater weight on assignments
in which the two variables agree. Many applications in computer vision and statistical physics can
be expressed as attractive pairwise graphical models (e.g.  the ferromagnetic Ising model). Sudderth 
Wainwright  and Willsky [2] used a loop series expansion of Chertkov and Chernyak [3  4] in order
to study the ﬁxed points of BP over attractive graphical models. They provided conditions on the
ﬁxed points of BP under which the stationary points of the Bethe free energy function corresponding
to these ﬁxed points are a lower bound on the true partition function. Empirically  they observed that 
even when their conditions were not satisﬁed  the Bethe partition function appeared to lower bound
the true partition function  and they conjectured that this is always the case for attractive pairwise
binary graphical models.
Recent work on the relationship between the Bethe partition function and the graph covers of a
given graphical model has suggested a new approach to resolving this conjecture. Vontobel [5]
demonstrated that the Bethe partition function can be precisely characterized by the average of the

1

true partition functions corresponding to graph covers of the base graphical model. The primary
contribution of the present work is to show that  for graphical models with log-supermodular po-
tentials  the partition function associated with any graph cover of the base graph  appropriately
normalized  must lower bound the true partition function. As pairwise binary graphical models are
log-supermodular if and only if they are attractive  combining our result with the observations of [5]
resolves the conjecture of [2].
The key element in our proof  and the second contribution of this work  is a new variant of the
“four functions” theorem that is speciﬁc to log-supermodular functions. We state and prove this
variant in Section 3.1  and in Section 4.1  we use it to resolve the conjecture. As a ﬁnal contri-
bution  we demonstrate that our variant of the “four functions” theorem has applications beyond
log-supermodular functions: as an example  we use it to show that the Bethe partition function can
also provide a lower bound on the number of independent sets in a bipartite graph.

2 Undirected Graphical Models
Let f : {0  1}n → R≥0 be a non-negative function. We say that f factors with respect to a hyper-
graph G = (V A) where A ⊆ 2V   if there exist potential functions φi : {0  1} → R≥0 for each
i ∈ V and ψα : {0  1}|α| → R≥0 for each α ∈ A such that

(cid:89)

i∈V

(cid:89)

α∈A

f (x) =

φi(xi)

ψα(xα)

where xα is the subvector of the vector x indexed by the set α.
We will express the hypergraph G as a bipartite graph that consists of a variable node for each i ∈ V  
a factor node for each α ∈ A  and an edge joining the factor node corresponding to α to the variable
node representing i if i ∈ α. This is typically referred to as the factor graph representation of G.
Deﬁnition 2.1. A function f : {0  1}n → R≥0 is log-supermodular if for all x  y ∈ {0  1}n

f (x)f (y) ≤ f (x ∧ y)f (x ∨ y)

where (x∧y)i = min{xi  yi} and (x∨y)i = max{xi  yi}. Similarly  a function f : {0  1}n → R≥0
is log-submodular if for all x  y ∈ {0  1}n

f (x)f (y) ≥ f (x ∧ y)f (x ∨ y).

Deﬁnition 2.2. A factorization of a function f : {0  1}n → R≥0 over G = (V A) is log-
supermodular if for all α ∈ A  ψα(xα) is log-supermodular.
Every function that admits a log-supermodular factorization is necessarily log-supermodular  prod-
ucts of log-supermodular functions are easily seen to be log-supermodular  but the converse may not
be true outside of special cases. If |α| ≤ 2 for each α ∈ A  then we call the factorization pairwise.
For any pairwise factorization  f is log-supermodular if and only if ψij is log-supermodular for each
i and j.
Pairwise graphical models such that ψα(xα) is log-supermodular for all α ∈ A are referred to
as attractive graphical models. A generalization of attractive interactions to the non-pairwise case
is presented in [2]: for all α ∈ A  ψα  when appropriately normalized  has non-negative central
moments. However  the relationship between this generalization and log-supermodularity remains
unclear.

2.1 Graph Covers

Graph covers have played an important role in our understanding of graphical models [5  6].
Roughly  if a graph H covers a graph G  then H looks locally the same as G.
Deﬁnition 2.3. A graph H covers a graph G = (V  E) if there exists a graph homomorphism
h : H → G such that for all vertices v ∈ G and all w ∈ h−1(v)  h maps the neighborhood ∂w of w
in H bijectively to the neighborhood ∂v of v in G. If h(w) = v  then we say that w ∈ H is a copy
of v ∈ G. Further  H is a k-cover of G if every vertex of G has exactly k copies in H.

Figure 1: An example of a graph cover. The nodes in the cover are labeled for the node that they
copy in the base graph.

For an example of a graph cover  see Figure 1.
For the factor graph corresponding to G = (V A)  each k-cover consists of a variable node for
each of the k|V | variables  a factor node for each of the k|A| factors  and an edge joining each copy
of α ∈ A to a distinct copy of each i ∈ α. To any k-cover H = (VH  AH ) of G given by the
homomorphism h  we can associate a collection of potentials: the potential at node i ∈ VH is equal
to φh(i)  the potential at node h(i) ∈ G  and for each α ∈ AH  we associate the potential ψh(α). In
this way  we can construct a function f H : {0  1}kn → R≥0 such that f H factorizes over H.
Notice that if f G admits a log-supermodular factorization over G and H is a k-cover of G  then f H
admits a log-supermodular factorization over H.

2.2 Bethe Approximations
For a function f : {0  1}n → R≥0 that factorizes over G = (V A)  we are interested computing
x f (x). In general  this is an NP-hard problem  but in practice 
algorithms  such as belief propagation  based on variational approximations produce reasonable esti-
mates in many settings. One such variational approximation  the Bethe approximation at temperature
T = 1  is deﬁned as follows:

the partition function Z(G) = (cid:80)

τi(xi) = 1}.

The ﬁxed points of the belief propagation algorithm correspond to stationary points of log ZB(G  τ )
over T   the set of pseudomarginals [1]  and the Bethe partition function is deﬁned to be the maximum
value achieved by this approximation over T :

ZB(G) = max

τ∈T ZB(G  τ ).

For a ﬁxed factor graph G  we are interested in the relationship between the true partition function 
Z(G)  and the Bethe approximation corresponding to G  ZB(G). While  in general  ZB(G) can be
either an upper or a lower bound on the true partition function  in this work  we address the following
conjecture of [2]:
Conjecture 2.4. If f : {0  1}n → R≥0 admits a pairwise  log-supermodular factorization over
G = (V A)  then ZB(G) ≤ Z(G).
We resolve this conjecture in the afﬁrmative  and show that it continues to hold for a larger class of
log-supermodular functions. Our results are based  primarily  on two observations: a variant of the
“four functions” theorem [7] and the following  recent theorem of Vontobel [5]:

H∈Ck(G)

Z(H)/|Ck(G)|

where Ck(G) is the set of all k-covers of G. 1

Proof. See Theorem 27 of [5].
Theorem 2.5 suggests that a reasonable strategy for proving that ZB(G) ≤ Z(G) would be to show
that Z(H) ≤ Z(G)k for any k-cover H of G. This is the strategy that we adopt in the remainder of
this work.

3 The “Four Functions” Theorem and Related Results

The “four functions” theorem [7] is a general result concerning nonnegative functions over distribu-
tive lattices. Many correlation inequalities from statistical physics  such as the FKG inequality  can
be seen as special cases of this theorem [8].
Theorem 3.1 (“Four Functions” Theorem). Let f1  f2  f3  f4 : {0  1}n → R≥0 be nonnegative
real-valued functions. If for all x  y ∈ {0  1}n 

then

f4(x)

The following lemma is a direct consequence of the four functions theorem:
Lemma 3.2. If f : {0  1}n → R≥0 is log-supermodular  then every marginal of f is also log-
supermodular.
The four functions theorem can be extended to more than four functions  by generalizing ∧ and
∨. For any collection of vectors x1  . . .   xk ∈ Rn  let zi(x1  . . .   xk) be the vector whose jth
j for each j ∈ {1  . . .   n}. As an example  for
component is the ith largest element of x1
j ≥ i} where {· ≥ ·} is one if the
inequality is satisﬁed and zero otherwise. The “four functions” theorem is then a special case of the
more general “2k functions” theorem [9  10  11]:
Theorem 3.3 (“2k Functions” Theorem). Let f1  . . .   fk : {0  1}n → R≥0 and g1  . . .   gk :
{0  1}n → R≥0 be nonnegative real-valued functions. If for all x1  . . .   xk ∈ {0  1}n

3.1 A Variant of the “Four Functions” Theorem

A natural generalization of Theorem 3.3 would be to replace the product of functions on the left-hand
side of Equation 1 with an arbitrary function over x1  . . .   xk: we will show that we can replace this
product with an arbitrary log-supermodular function while preserving the conclusion of the theorem.
The key property of log-supermodular functions that makes this possible is the following lemma:

1The proof of the theorem is demonstrated for “normal” factor graphs  but it easily extends to the factor

graphs described above by replacing variable nodes with equality constraints.

Lemma 3.4. If g : {0  1}n → R≥0 is log-supermodular  then for any integer k ≥ 1 and

x1  . . .   xk ∈ {0  1}n (cid:81)k

i=1 g(xi) ≤(cid:81)k

i=1 g(zi(x1  . . .   xk)).

Proof. This follows directly from the log-supermodularity of g.

The proof of our variant of the “2k functions theorem” uses the properties of weak majorizations:
Deﬁnition 3.5. A vector x ∈ Rn is weakly majorized by a vector y ∈ Rn  denoted x ≺w y  if

(cid:80)t
i=1 zi(x1  . . .   xn) ≤(cid:80)t
Theorem 3.6. For x  y ∈ Rn  x ≺w y if and only if(cid:80)n

i=1 zi(y1  . . .   yn) for all t ∈ {1  . . .   n}.

For the purposes of this paper  we will only need the following result concerning weak majorizations:
i=1 g(yi) for all continuous 
increasing  and convex functions g : R → R.

i=1 g(xi) ≤(cid:80)n

Proof. See 3.C.1.b and 4.B.2 of [12].

We now state and prove our variant of the 2k functions theorem in two pieces. First  we consider
the case where n = 1:
Lemma 3.7. Let f1  . . .   fk : {0  1} → R≥0 and g : {0  1}k → R≥0 be nonnegative real-valued
functions such that g is log-supermodular. If for all x1  . . .   xk ∈ {0  1}

Proof. For each c ∈ {0  . . .   k}  deﬁne X c = {(x1  . . .   xk) : x1 + . . . + xk = c}. Let Gc ∈ R(k

be the vector obtained from by evaluating g at each element of X c  and deﬁne F c similarly for

by Theorem 3.6 and the fact that 2x is convex and increasing  we will have

for all c. As the X c are disjoint  this will complete the proof. We note that  by continuity arguments 
this analysis holds even when some values of g and f are equal to zero.

Now  ﬁx c ∈ {0  . . .   k} and T ∈ {1  . . .  (cid:0)k

By Lemma 3.4  we must have

As our construction will work for any choice of distinct vectors v1  . . .   vT ∈ X c  it will work 
t=1 g(vt)  and the lemma will then
follow as a consequence of our previous arguments.
We now describe how to construct the vectors v1  . . .   vT from the vectors v1  . . .   vT . Let A ∈
Rk×T be the matrix whose ith column is given by the vector vi. Construct A ∈ Rk×T from A
p Ajp. Intuitively 
the ﬁrst row of A corresponds to the row of A with the most nonzero elements  the second row
of A corresponds to the row of A with the second largest number of nonzero elements  and so on.
Let v1  . . .   vT be the columns of A. Notice that v1  . . .   vT are distinct vectors in X c and that  by
construction  zj(zt(v1  . . .   vT )1  . . .   zt(v1  . . .   vT )k) = zt(v1  . . .   vT )j for each j ∈ {1  . . .   k}
and t ∈ {1  . . .   T}. Therefore  we must have

g(vt) ≤ T(cid:89)

where the equality follows from the deﬁnition of f as a product of the fi. In addition  the vector
zt(v1  . . .   vT ) is simply a permuted version of the vector zt(v1  . . .   vT ) which means that their jth
largest elements must agree:
wt

j = zj(zt(v1  . . .   vT )1  . . .   zt(v1  . . .   vT )k)

= zt(v1  . . .   vT )j.

and the lemma follows as a consequence .
Remark. In the case that n = 1 and k ≥ 1  this lemma is a more general result than the 2k functions
i gi(xi) for g1  . . .   gk : {0  1} → R≥0  then g is log-supermodular.
As in the proof of the 2k functions theorem  the general theorem for n ≥ 1 follows by induction on
n.This inductive proof closely follows the inductive argument in the proof of the “four functions”
theorem described in [8] with the added observation that marginals of log-supermodular functions
continue to be log-supermodular.
Theorem 3.8. Let f1  . . .   fk : {0  1}n → R≥0 and g : {0  1}kn → R≥0 be nonnegative real-valued

let f1  . . .   fk : {0  1}n → R≥0 and g : {0  1}kn → R≥0 be nonnegative real-valued functions such
that g is log-supermodular.

f(cid:48)

4 Graph Covers and the Partition Function

In this section  we show how to apply Theorem 3.8 in order to resolve Conjecture 2.4. In addition  we
show that the theorem can be applied more generally to yield similar results for a class of functions
that can be converted into log-supermodular functions by a change of variables.

4.1 Log-supermodularity and Graph Covers

The following theorem follows easily from Theorem 3.8:
Theorem 4.1. If f G : {0  1}n → R≥0 admits a log-supermodular factorization over G = (V A) 
then for any k-cover  H  of G  Z(H) ≤ Z(G)k.

Proof. Let H be a k-cover of G. Divide the vertices of H into k sets S1  . . .   Sk such that each set
contains exactly one copy of each vertex i ∈ V . Let the assignments to the variables in the set Si be
denoted by the vector xi.
For each α ∈ A  let yi

This theorem settles the conjecture of [2] for any log-supermodular function that admits a pairwise
binary factorization  and the conjecture continues to hold for any graphical model that admits a
log-supermodular factorization.
Corollary 4.2. If f : {0  1}n → R≥0 admits a log-supermodular factorization over G = (V A) 
then ZB(G) ≤ Z(G).

Proof. This follows directly from Theorem 4.1 and Theorem 2.5.

As the value of the Bethe approximation at any of the ﬁxed points of BP is always a lower bound on
ZB(G)  the conclusion of the corollary holds for any ﬁxed point of the BP algorithm as well.

4.2 Beyond Log-supermodularity

While Theorem 4.1 is a statement only about log-supermodular functions  we can use it to infer
similar results even when the function under consideration is not log-supermodular. As an example
of such an application  we consider the problem of counting the number of independent sets in a
given graph  G = (V  E). An independent set  I ⊆ V   in G is a subset of the vertices such that no
two adjacent vertices are in I. We deﬁne the following function:

I G(x1  . . .   x|V |) =

(1 − xixj)

(cid:89)

(i j)∈E

which is equal to one if the nonzero xi’s deﬁne an independent set and zero otherwise. As every
potential function depends on at most two variables  I G factorizes over the graph G = (V  E).
Notice that f G is log-submodular  not log-supermodular.
In this section  we will focus on bipartite graphs: G = (V  E) is bipartite if we can partition the
vertex set into two sets A ⊆ V and B = V \ A such that A and B are independent sets. Examples
of bipartite graphs include single cycles  trees  and grid graphs. We will denote bipartite graphs as
G = (A  B  E).
For any bipartite graph G = (A  B  E)  I G can be converted into a log-supermodular graphical
model by a simple change of variables. Deﬁne ya = xa for all a ∈ A and yb = 1− xb for all b ∈ B.
We then have

I G(x1  . . .   x|V |) =

G admits a log-supermodular factorization over G and(cid:80)
graph cover H of G  we have(cid:80)

x I G(x). Similarly  for any
x I H (x). Consequently  by Theorem 4.1  we can
conclude that Z(G) ≥ ZB(G). Similar observations can be used to show that the Bethe partition
function provides a lower bound on the true partition function for other problems that factor over
pairwise bipartite graphical models (e.g.  the antiferromagnetic Ising model on a grid).

5 Conclusions

While the results presented above were discussed in the case that the temperature parameter  T   was
equal to one  they easily extend to any T ≥ 0 (as exponentiation preserves log-supermodularity in
this case). Hence  all of the bounds discussed above can be extended to the problem of maximizing
a log-supermodular function. In particular  the inequality in Theorem 4.1 shows that the maximum
value of the objective function on any graph cover is achieved by a lift of a maximizing assignment
on the base graph.
This work also suggests a number of directions for future research. Related work on the Bethe
approximation for permanents suggests that conjectures similar to those discussed above can be
made for other classes of functions [13  14]. While  like the “four functions” theorem  many of the
above results can be extended to general distributive lattices  understanding when similar results may
hold for non-binary problems may be of interest for graphical models that arise in certain application
areas such as computer vision.
