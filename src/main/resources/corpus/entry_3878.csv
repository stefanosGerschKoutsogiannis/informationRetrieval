Abstract

We study the problem of minimising regret in two-armed bandit problems with
Gaussian rewards. Our objective is to use this simple setting to illustrate that
strategies based on an exploration phase (up to a stopping time) followed by
exploitation are necessarily suboptimal. The results hold regardless of whether
or not the difference in means between the two arms is known. Besides the
main message  we also reﬁne existing deviation inequalities  which allow us to
design fully sequential strategies with ﬁnite-time regret guarantees that are (a)
asymptotically optimal as the horizon grows and (b) order-optimal in the minimax
sense. Furthermore we provide empirical evidence that the theory also holds in
practice and discuss extensions to non-gaussian and multiple-armed case.

Introduction

It is now a very frequent issue for companies to optimise their daily proﬁts by choosing between
one of two possible website layouts. A natural approach is to start with a period of A/B Testing
(exploration) during which the two versions are uniformly presented to users. Once the testing is
complete  the company displays the version believed to generate the most proﬁt for the rest of the
month (exploitation). The time spent exploring may be chosen adaptively based on past observations 
but could also be ﬁxed in advance. Our contribution is to show that strategies of this form are
much worse than if the company is allowed to dynamically select which website to display without
restrictions for the whole month.
Our analysis focusses on a simple sequential decision problem played over T time-steps. In time-step
t ∈ 1  2  . . .   T the agent chooses an action At ∈ {1  2} and receives a normally distributed reward

This framework is known as the multi-armed bandit problem  which has many applications and
has been studied for almost a century [Thompson  1933]. Although this setting is now quite well
understood  the purpose of this article is to show that strategies based on distinct phases of exploration
and exploitation are necessarily suboptimal. This is an important message because exploration
followed by exploitation is the most natural approach and is often implemented in applications
(including the website optimisation problem described above). Moreover  strategies of this kind
have been proposed in the literature for more complicated settings [Auer and Ortner  2010  Perchet
and Rigollet  2013  Perchet et al.  2015]. Recent progress on optimal exploration policies (e.g.  by
Garivier and Kaufmann [2016]) could have suggested that well-tuned variants of two-phase strategies
might be near-optimal. We show  on the contrary  that optimal strategies for multi-armed bandit
problems must be fully-sequential  and in particular should mix exploration and exploitation. It is
known since the work of Wald [1945] on simple hypothese testing that sequential procedures can lead
to signiﬁcant gains. Here  the superiority of fully sequential procedures is consistent with intuition: if
one arm ﬁrst appears to be better  but if subsequent observations are disappointing  the obligation to
commit at some point can be restrictive. In this paper  we give a crisp and precise description of how
restrictive it is: it leads to regret asympotically twice as large on average. The proof of this result
combines some classical techniques of sequential analysis and of the bandit literature.
We study two settings  one when the gap ∆ = |µ1 − µ2| is known and the other when it is not.
The most straight-forward strategy in the former case is to explore each action a ﬁxed number
of times n and subsequently exploit by choosing the action that appeared best while exploring.
It is easy to calculate the optimal n and consequently show that this strategy suffers a regret of
µ(T ) ∼ 4 log(T )/∆. A more general approach is to use a so-called Explore-Then-Commit (ETC)
Rπ
strategy  following a nomenclature introduced by Perchet et al. [2015]. An ETC strategy explores
each action alternately until some data-dependent stopping time and subsequently commits to a single
action for the remaining time-steps. We show in Theorem 2 that by using a sequential probability ratio
µ(T ) ∼ log(T )/∆  which improves
test (SPRT) it is possible to design an ETC strategy for which Rπ
on the above result by a factor of 4. We also prove a lower bound showing that no ETC strategy can
improve on this result. Surprisingly it is possible to do even better by using a fully sequential strategy
inspired by the UCB algorithm for multi-armed bandits [Katehakis and Robbins  1995]. We design a
µ(T ) ∼ log(T )/(2∆)  which improves on the ﬁxed-design strategy by a
new strategy for which Rπ
factor of 8 and on SPRT by a factor of 2. Again we prove a lower bound showing that no strategy can
improve on this result.
For the case where ∆ is unknown  ﬁxed-design strategies are hopeless because there is no reasonable
tuning for the exploration budget n. However  it is possible to design an ETC strategy for unknown
gaps. Our approach uses a modiﬁed ﬁxed-budget best arm identiﬁcation (BAI) algorithm in its
exploration phase (see e.g.  Even-Dar et al. [2006]  Garivier and Kaufmann [2016]) and chooses the
recommended arm for the remaining time-steps. In Theorem 5 we show that a strategy based on
µ(T ) ∼ 4 log(T )/∆  which again we show is optimal within the class of ETC
this idea satisﬁes Rπ
strategies. As before  strategies based on ETC are suboptimal by a factor of 2 relative to the optimal
µ(T ) ∼ 2 log(T )/∆
rates achieved by fully sequential strategies such as UCB  which satisﬁes Rπ
[Katehakis and Robbins  1995].
In a nutshell  strategies based on ﬁxed-design or ETC are necessarily suboptimal. That this failure
occurs even in the simple setting considered here is a strong indicator that they are suboptimal in
more complicated settings. Our main contribution  presented in more details in Section 2  is to fully
characterise the achievable asymptotic regret when ∆ is either known or unknown and the strategies
are either ﬁxed-design  ETC or fully sequential. All upper bounds have explicit ﬁnite-time forms 
which allow us to derive optimal minimax guarantees. For the lower bounds we give a novel and
generic proof of all results. All proofs contain new  original ideas that we believe are fundamental to
the understanding of sequential analysis.

2 Notation and Summary of Results
We assume that the horizon T is known to the agent. The optimal action is a∗ = arg max(µ1  µ2)  its
mean reward is µ∗ = µa∗  and the gap between the means is ∆ = |µ1 − µ2|. Let H = R2 be the set

of all possible pairs of means  and H∆ =(cid:8)µ ∈ R2 : |µ1 − µ2| = ∆(cid:9). For i ∈ {1  2} and n ∈ N let
in time-step t and Ni(t) =(cid:80)t

ˆµi n be the empirical mean of the ith action based on the ﬁrst n samples. Let At be the action chosen
1{As = i} be the number of times the ith action has been chosen
after time-step t. We denote by ˆµi(t) = ˆµi Ni(t) the empirical mean of the ith arm after time-step t.
A strategy is denoted by π  which is a function from past actions/rewards to a distribution over the
next actions. An ETC strategy is governed by a sampling rule (which determines which arm to sample
at each step)  a stopping rule (which speciﬁes when to stop the exploration phase) and a decision
rule indicating which arm is chosen in the exploitation phase. As we consider two-armed  Gaussian
bandits with equal variances  we focus here on uniform sampling rules  which have been shown
in Kaufmann et al. [2014] to be optimal in that setting. For this reason  we deﬁne an ETC strategy as
a pair (τ  ˆa)  where τ is an even stopping time with respect to the ﬁltration (Ft = σ(Z1  . . .   Zt))t
and ˆa ∈ {1  2} is Fτ -measurable. In all the ETC strategies presented in this paper  the stopping time
τ depends on the horizon T (although this is not reﬂected in the notation). At time t  the action

s=1

if t ≤ τ and t is odd  
if t ≤ τ and t is even

ˆa otherwise .

picked by the ETC strategy is At =

The regret for strategy π  given in Eq. (1)  depends on T and µ. Assuming  for example that µ1 =
2 + (T − τ )+1{ˆa = 2}
µ2 + ∆  then an ETC strategy π chooses the suboptimal arm N2(T ) = τ∧T
times  and the regret Rπ

µ(T ) = ∆Eµ[N2(T )] thus satisﬁes

∆Eµ[(τ ∧ T )/2] ≤ Rπ

µ(T ) ≤ (∆/2)Eµ[τ ∧ T ] + ∆T Pµ(τ ≤ T  ˆa (cid:54)= a∗) .

(2)

We denote the set of all ETC strategies by ΠETC. A ﬁxed-design strategy is and ETC strategy for
which there exists an integer n such that τ = 2n almost surely  and the set of all such strategies is
denoted by ΠDETC. The set of all strategies is denoted by ΠALL. For S ∈ {H H∆}  we are interested
in strategies π that are uniformly efﬁcient on S  in the sense that

∀µ ∈ S ∀α > 0  Rπ

µ(T ) = o(T α).

We show in this paper that any uniformly efﬁcient strategy in Π
has a regret at least equal to C ΠS log(T )/|µ1 − µ2|(1 − oT (1))
for every parameter µ ∈ S  where C ΠS is given in the adjacent
table. Furthermore  we prove that these results are tight. In
each case  we propose a uniformly efﬁcient strategy matching
this bound. In addition  we prove a tight and non-asymptotic regret bound which also implies  in
particular  minimax rate-optimality.
The paper is organised as follows. First we consider ETC and ﬁxed-design strategies when ∆ known
and unknown (Section 3). We then analyse fully sequential strategies that interleave exploration and
exploitation in an optimal way (Section 4). For known ∆ we present a novel algorithm that exploits
the additional information to improve the regret. For unknown ∆ we brieﬂy recall the well-known
results  but also propose a new regret analysis of the UCB* algorithm  a variant of UCB that can
be traced back to Lai [1987]  for which we also obtain order-optimal minimax regret. Numerical
experiments illustrate and empirically support our results in Section 5. We conclude with a short
discussion on non-uniform exploration  and on models with more than 2 arms  possibly non Gaussian.
All the proofs are given in the supplementary material. In particular  our simple  uniﬁed proof for all
the lower bounds is given in Appendix A.

The proof of Theorem 1 is in Appendix B. Note that the "asymptotic lower bound" 4 log(T )/∆ is
µ(T ) − 4 log(T )/∆ → −∞ when
actually not a lower bound  even up to an additive constant: Rn
T → ∞. Actually  the same phenomenon applies many other cases  and it should be no surprise that 
in numerical experiments  some algorithm reach a regret smaller than Lai and Robbins asymptotic
lower bound  as was already observed in several articles (see e.g. Garivier et al. [2016]). Also note
that the term ∆ at the end of the upper bound is necessary: if ∆ is large  the problem is statistically
so simple that one single observation is sufﬁcient to identify the best arm; but that observation cannot
be avoided.

Explore-Then-Commit Strategies for Known Gaps. We now show the existence of ETC strategies
that improve on the optimal ﬁxed-design strategy. Surprisingly  the gain is signiﬁcant. We describe
an algorithm inspired by ideas from hypothesis testing and prove an upper bound on its regret that is
minimax optimal and that asymptotically matches our lower bound.
Let P be the law of X − Y   where X (resp. Y ) is a reward from arm 1 (resp. arm 2). As ∆ is
known  the exploration phase of an ETC algorithm can be viewed as a statistical test of the hypothesis
H1 : (P = N (∆  2)) against H2 : (P = N (−∆  2)). The work of Wald [1945] shows that a
signiﬁcant gain in terms of expected number of samples can be obtained by using a sequential rather
than a batch test. Indeed  for a batch test  a sample size of n ∼ (4/∆2) log(1/δ) is necessary to
guarantee that both type I and type II errors are upper bounded by δ. In contrast  when a random
number of samples is permitted  there exists a sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) with the same
guarantees that stops after a random number N of samples with expectation E[N ] ∼ log(1/δ)/∆2
under both H1 and H2. The SPRT stops when the absolute value of the log-likelihood ratio between
H1 and H2 exceeds some threshold. Asymptotic upper bound on the expected number of samples
used by a SPRT  as well as the (asymptotic) optimality of such procedures among the class of all
sequential tests can be found in [Wald  1945  Siegmund  1985].
Algorithm 2 is an ETC strategy that explores
each action alternately  halting when sufﬁcient
conﬁdence is reached according to a SPRT. The
threshold depends on the gap ∆ and the horizon
T corresponding to a risk of δ = 1/(T ∆2). The
exploration phase ends at the stopping time

A simple idea for constructing an algorithm that matches the lower bound is to use a (ﬁxed-conﬁdence)
best arm identiﬁcation algorithm for the exploration phase. Given a risk parameter δ  a δ-PAC BAI
algorithm consists of a sampling rule (At)  a stopping rule τ and a recommendation rule ˆa which
is Fτ measurable and satisﬁes  for all µ ∈ H such that µ1 (cid:54)= µ2  Pµ(ˆa = a∗) ≥ 1 − δ. In a bandit
model with two Gaussian arms  Kaufmann et al. [2014] propose a δ-PAC algorithm using a uniform
sampling rule and a stopping rule τδ that asymptotically attains the minimal sample complexity
Eµ[τδ] ∼ (8/∆2) log(1/δ). Using the regret decomposition (2)  it is easy to show that the ETC
algorithm using the stopping rule τδ for δ = 1/T matches the lower bound of Theorem 4.
Algorithm 3 is a slight variant of this optimal BAI
algorithm  based on the stopping time

The motivation for the difference (which comes from
a more carefully tuned threshold featuring log(T /2n)
in place of log(T )) is that the conﬁdence level should
depend on the unknown gap ∆  which determines the
regret when a mis-identiﬁcation occurs. The improve-
ment only appears in the non-asymptotic regime where
we are able to prove both asymptotic optimality and
order-optimal minimax regret. The latter would not be possible using a ﬁxed-conﬁdence BAI strategy.
The proof of this result can be found in Appendix D. The main difﬁculty is developing a sufﬁciently
strong deviation bound  which we do in Appendix G  and that may be of independent interest. Note
that a similar strategy was proposed and analysed by Lai et al. [1983]  but in the continuous time
framework and with asymptotic analysis only.

4 Fully Sequential Strategies for Known and Unknown Gaps

In the previous section we saw that allowing a random stopping time leads to a factor of 4 improvement
in terms of the asymptotic regret relative to the naive ﬁxed-design strategy. We now turn our attention
to fully sequential strategies when ∆ is known and unknown. The latter case is the classic 2-armed
bandit problem and is now quite well understood. Our modest contribution in that case is the ﬁrst
algorithm that is simultaneously asymptotically optimal and order optimal in the minimax sense. For
the former case  we are not aware of any previous research where the gap is known except the line of
work by Bubeck et al. [2013]  Bubeck and Liu [2013]  where different questions are treated. In both
cases we see that fully sequential strategies improve on the best ETC strategies by a factor of 2.

Known Gaps. We start by stating the lower bound (proved in Section A)  which is a straightforward
generalisation of Lai and Robbins’ lower bound.

We are not aware of any existing algorithm matching this lower bound  which motivates us to
introduce a new strategy called ∆-UCB that exploits the knowledge of ∆ to improve the performance
of UCB. In each round the algorithm chooses the arm that has been played most often so far unless
the other arm has an upper conﬁdence bound that is close to ∆ larger than the empirical estimate of
the most played arm. Like ETC strategies  ∆-UCB is not anytime in the sense that it requires the
knowledge of both the horizon T and the gap ∆.

We represent here the regret of the ﬁve strategies presented in this article on a bandit problem
with ∆ = 1/5  for different values of the horizon. The regret is estimated by 4.105 Monte-Carlo
replications. In the legend  the estimated slopes of ∆Rπ(T ) (in logarithmic scale) are indicated after
the policy names.

The experimental behavior of the algorithms reﬂects the theoretical results presented above: the
regret asymptotically grows as the logarithm of the horizon  the experimental coefﬁcients correspond
approximately to theory  and the relative ordering of the policies is respected. However  it should
be noted that for short horizons the hierarchy is not quite the same  and the growth rate is not
logarithmic; this question is raised in Garivier et al. [2016]. In particular  on short horizons the
Best-Arm Identiﬁcation procedure performs very well with respect to the others  and starts to be
beaten (even by the gap-aware strategies) only when T ∆2 is much larger that 10.

distributions

It is worth emphasising the impossibility of non-trivial lower bounds on the regret of ETC strategies
using any possible (non-uniform) sampling rule. Indeed  using UCB as a sampling rule together with
an a.s. inﬁnite stopping rule deﬁnes an artiﬁcial but formally valid ETC strategy that achieves the best
possible rate for general strategies. This strategy is not a faithful counter-example to our claim that
ETC strategies are sub-optimal  because UCB is not a satisfying exploration rule. If exploration is the
objective  then uniform sampling is known to be optimal in the two-armed Gaussian case [Kaufmann
et al.  2014]  which justiﬁes the uniform sampling assumption.
The use of ETC strategies for regret minimisation (e.g.  as presented by Perchet and Rigollet [2013])
is certainly not limited to bandit models with 2 arms. The extension to multiple arms is based on the
successive elimination idea in which a set of active arms is maintained with arms chosen according
to a round robin within the active set. Arms are eliminated from the active set once their optimality
becomes implausible and the exploration phase terminates when the active set contains only a single
arm (an example is by Auer and Ortner [2010]). The Successive Elimination algorithm has been
introduced by Even-Dar et al. [2006] for best-arm identiﬁcation in the ﬁxed-conﬁdence setting. It was
shown to be rate-optimal  and thus a good compromise for both minimizing regret and ﬁnding the
best arm. If one looks more precisely at mutliplicative constants  however  Garivier and Kaufmann
[2016] showed that it is suboptimal for the best arm identiﬁcation task in almost all settings except
two-armed Gaussian bandits. Regarding regret minimization  the present paper shows that it is
sub-optimal by a factor 2 on every two-armed Gaussian problem.
It is therefore interesting to investigate the performance in terms of regret of an ETC algorithm
using an optimal BAI algorithm. This is actually possible not only for Gaussian distributions  but
more generally for one-parameter exponential families  for which Garivier and Kaufmann [2016]
propose the asymptotically optimal Track-and-Stop strategy. Denoting d(µ  µ(cid:48)) = KL(νµ  νµ(cid:48)) the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between two distributions parameterised by µ and µ(cid:48)  they provide
results which can be adapted to obtain the following bound.
Proposition 1. For µ such that µ1 > maxa(cid:54)=1 µa  the regret of the ETC strategy using Track-and-Stop
exploration with risk 1/T satisﬁes

where T ∗(µ) (resp. w∗(µ)) is the the maximum (resp. maximiser) of the optimisation problem

where ΣK is the set of probability distributions on {1  . . .   K}.
In general  it is not easy to quantify the difference to the lower bound of Lai and Robbins

Even for Gaussian distributions  there is no general closed-form formula for T ∗(µ) and w∗(µ) except
when K = 2. However  we conjecture that the worst case is when µ1 and µ2 are much larger than
the other means: then  the regret is almost the same as in the 2-arm case  and ETC strategies are
suboptimal by a factor 2. On the other hand  the most favourable case (in terms of relative efﬁciency)
seems to be when µ2 = ··· = µK: then
