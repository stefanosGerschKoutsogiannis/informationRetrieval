Abstract

We study worst-case bounds on the quality of any ﬁxed point assignment of the
max-product algorithm for Markov Random Fields (MRF). We start providing a
bound independent of the MRF structure and parameters. Afterwards  we show
how this bound can be improved for MRFs with speciﬁc structures such as bipar-
tite graphs or grids. Our results provide interesting insight into the behavior of
max-product. For example  we prove that max-product provides very good results
(at least 90% optimal) on MRFs with large variable-disjoint cycles1.

Introduction

Graphical models such as Markov Random Fields (MRFs) have been successfully applied to a wide
variety of applications such as image understanding [1]  error correcting codes [2]  protein folding
[3] and multi-agent systems coordination [4]. Many of these practical problems can be formulated
as ﬁnding the maximum a posteriori (MAP) assignment  namely the most likely joint variable as-
signment in an MRF. The MAP problem is NP-hard [5]  thus requiring approximate methods.
Here we focus on a particular MAP approximate method: the (loopy) max-product belief propaga-
tion [6  7]. Max-product’s popularity stems from its very good empirical performance on general
MRFs [8  9  10  11]  but it comes with few theoretical guarantees. Concretely  max-product is
known to be correct in acyclic and single-cycle MRFs [11]  although convergence is only guar-
anteed in the acyclic case. Recently  some works have established that max-product is guarantee
to return the optimal solution  if it converges  on MRFs corresponding to some speciﬁc problems 
namely: (i) weighted b-matching problems [12  13]; (ii) maximum weight independent set problems
[14]; or (iii) problems whose equivalent nand Markov random ﬁeld (NMRF) is a perfect graph [?].
For weighted b-matching problems with a bipartite structure Huang and Jebara [15] establish that
max-product algorithm always converges to the optimal.
Despite these guarantees provided in these particular cases  for arbitrary MRFs little is known on
the quality of the max-product ﬁxed-point assignments. To the best of our knowledge  the only
result in this line is the work of Wainwright et al. [16] where  given any arbitrary MRF  authors
derive an upper bound on the absolute error of the max-product ﬁxed-point assignment. This bound

cycle contains at least 20 variables.

is calculated after running the max-sum algorithm and depends on the particular MRF (structure
and parameters) and therefore provide no guarantees on the quality of max-product assignments on
arbitrary MRFs with cycles.
In this paper we provide quality guarantees for max-product ﬁxed-points in general settings that can
be calculated prior to the execution of the algorithm. To this end  we deﬁne worst-case bounds on the
quality of any max-product ﬁxed-point for any MRF  independently of its structure and parameters.
Furthermore  we show how tighter guarantees can be obtained for MRFs with speciﬁc structures.
For example  we prove that in 2-D grids max-product ﬁxed points assignments have at least 33% of
the quality of the optimum; and that for MRFs with large variable-disjoint cycles1 they have at least
90% of the quality of the optimum. These results shed some light on the relationship between the
quality of max-product assignments and the structure of MRFs.
Our results build upon two main components: (i) the characterization of any ﬁxed-point max-product
assignment as a neighbourhood maximum in a speciﬁc region of the MRF [17]; and (ii) the worst-
case bounds on the quality of a neighbourhood maximum obtained in the K-optimality framework
[18  19]. We combine these two results by: (i) generalising the worst-case bounds in [18  19] to
consider any arbitrary region; and (ii) assessing worst-case bounds for the speciﬁc region presented
in [17] (for which any ﬁxed-point max-product assignment is known to be maximal).

2 Overview

2.1 The max-sum algorithm in Pairwise Markov Random Fields

A discrete pairwise Markov Random Field (MRF) is an undirected graphical model where each in-
teraction is speciﬁed by a discrete potential function  deﬁned on a single or a pair of variables. The
structure of an MRF deﬁnes a graph G = (cid:104)V  E(cid:105)  in which the nodes V represent discrete variables 
and edges E represent interactions between nodes. Then  an MRF contains a unary potential func-
tion Ψs for each node s ∈ V and a pairwise potential function Ψst for each edge (s  t) ∈ E; the
joint probability distribution of the MRF assumes the following form:

Ψs(xs)  Ψ(xs  xt) which are well-deﬁned if Ψs(xs)  Ψ(xs  xt) are strictly positive.
Within this setting  the classical problem of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation corresponds
to ﬁnding the most likely conﬁguration under distribution p(x) in equation 1. In more formal terms 
s|s ∈ V } is given by:
the MAP conﬁguration x∗ = {x∗
(cid:89)

(cid:88)
(s t)∈E
where X N is the Cartesian product space in which x = {xs|s ∈ V } takes values.
Note that the MAP conﬁguration may not be unique  that is  there may be multiple conﬁgurations 
that attain the maximum in equation 1. In this work we assume that: (i) there is a unique MAP
assignment (as assumed in [17]); and (ii) all potentials θs and θst are non-negative.
The max-product algorithm is an iterative  local  message-passing algorithm for ﬁnding the MAP
assignment in a discrete MRF as speciﬁed by equation 2. The max-sum algorithm is the corre-
spondent of the max-product algorithm when we consider the log-likelihood domain. The standard
update rules for max-sum algorithm are:

where αij is a normalization constant and N (i) is the set of indices for variables that are connected
to xi. Here mij(xj) represents the message that variable xi sends to variable xj. At the ﬁrst iteration
all messages are initialised to constant functions. At each following iteration  each variable xi aggre-
gates all incoming messages and computes the belief bi(xi)  which is then used to obtain the max-
sum assignment xM S. Speciﬁcally  for every variable xi ∈ V we have xM S
i = arg maxxi bi(xi).

The convergence of the max-sum is usually characterized considering ﬁxed points for the message
update rules  i.e. when all the messages exchanged are equal to the last iteration. Now  the max-sum
algorithm is known to be correct over acyclic and single-cycle graphs. Unfortunately  on general
graphs the aggregation of messages ﬂowing into each variable only represents an approximate solu-
tion to the maximization problem. Nonetheless  it is possible to characterise the solution obtained
by max-sum as we discuss below.

2.2 Neighborhood maximum characterisation of max-sum ﬁxed points

In [17]  Weiss et al. characterize how well max-sum approximates the MAP assignment. In par-
ticular  they ﬁnd the conditions for a ﬁxed-point max-sum assignment xM S to be neighbourhood
maximum  namely greater than all other assignments in a speciﬁc large region around xM S. Notice
that characterising an assignment as neighbourhood maximum is weaker than a global maximum 
introduce the notion of Single Loops and Trees
but stronger than a local maximum. Weiss et al.
(SLT) region to characterise the assignments in such region.
Deﬁnition 1 (SLT region). An SLT-region of x in G includes all assignments x(cid:48) that can be obtained
from x by: (i) choosing an arbitrary subset S ⊆ V such that its vertex-induced subgraph contains at
most one cycle per connected component; (ii) assigning arbitrary values to the variables in S while
keeping the assignment to the other variables as in x.

Hence  we say that an assignment xSLT is SLT-optimal if it is greater than any other assignment in
its SLT region. Finally  the main result in [17] is the characterisation of any max-sum ﬁxed-point
assignments as an SLT-optimum. Figures 1(b)-(e) illustrate examples of assignments in the SLT-
region in the complete graph of ﬁgure 1(a)  here boldfaced nodes stand for variables that vary the
assignment with respect to xSLT .

3 Generalizing size and distance optimal bounds

In [18]  Pearce et al. introduced worst-case bounds on the quality of a neighbourhood maximum in a
region characterized by its size. Similary  Kiekintveld et al. introduced in [19] analogous worst-case
bounds but using as a criterion the distance in the graph. In this section we generalize these bounds to
use them for any neighbourhood maximum in a region characterized by arbitrary criteria. Concretely
we show that our generalization can be used for bounding the quality of max-sum assignments.
3.1 C-optimal bounds
Hereafter we propose a general notion of region optimality  the so-called C-optimality  and describe
how to calculate bounds for a C-optimal assignment  namely an assignment that is neighbourhood
maximum in a region characterized by an arbitrary C criteria. The concept of C-optimality requires
the introduction of several concepts.
Given A  B ⊆ V we say that B completely covers A if A ⊆ B. We say that B does not cover A
at all if A ∩ B = ∅. Otherwise  we say that B covers A partially. A region C ⊂ P(V ) is a set
composed by subsets of V . We say that A ⊆ V is covered by C if there is a C α ∈ C such that C α
completely covers A.
Given two assignments xA and xB  we deﬁne D(xA  xB) as the set containing the variables whose
values in xA and xB differ. An assignment is C-optimal if it cannot be improved by changing the
values in any group of variables covered by C. That is  an assignment xA is C-optimal if for every
assignment xB s.t. D(xA  xB) is covered by C we have that θ(xA) ≥ θ(xB).
For any S ∈ E we deﬁne cc(S C) = |{C α ∈ C s.t S ⊆ C α}|  that is  the number of elements in C
that cover S completely. We also deﬁne nc(S C) = |{C α ∈ C s.t S ∩ C α = ∅}|  that is  the number
of elements in C that do not cover S at all.

where cc∗ = minS∈E cc(S C)  nc∗ = minS∈E nc(S C)  and x∗ is the MAP assignment.
Proof. The proof is a generalization of the one in [20] for k-optimality. For every C α ∈ C  consider
i if xi ∈ C α. Since xC is C-optimal 
an assignment xα such that xα
for all C α ∈ C  θ(xC) ≥ θ(xα) holds  and hence:

we can always get rid of unary potentials by combining them into pairwise potentials without chang-
S∈E θS(xα). We
classify each edge S ∈ E into one of three disjoint groups  depending on whether C α covers S com-

3.2 Size-optimal bounds as a speciﬁc case of C-optimal bounds
Now we present the main result in [18] as a speciﬁc case of C-optimality. An assignment is k-size-
optimal if it can not be improved by changing the value of any group of size k or fewer variables.
Proposition 2. For any MRF and for any k-optimal assignment xk:

Proof. This result is just a speciﬁc case of our general result where we take as a region all subsets of

size k  that is C = {C α ⊆ V | |C α| = k}. The number of elements in the region is |C| =(cid:0)|V |
number of elements in C that completely cover S is cc(S C) =(cid:0)|V |−2

4 Quality guarantees on max-sum ﬁxed-point assignments

In this section we deﬁne quality guarantees for max-sum ﬁxed-point assignments in MRFs with
arbitary and speciﬁc structures. Our quality guarantees prove that the value of any max-sum ﬁxed-
point assignments can not be less than a fraction of the optimum.
The main idea is that by virtue of the characterization of any max-sum ﬁxed point assignment as
SLT-optimal  we can select any region C composed of a combination of single cycles and trees of
our graph and use it for computing its corresponding C-optimal bound by means of proposition 1.
We start by proving that bounds for a given graph apply to its subgraphs. Then  we ﬁnd that the
bound for the complete graph applies to any MRF independently of its structure and parameters.
Afterwards we provide tighter bounds for MRFs with speciﬁc structures.
4.1 C-optimal bounds based on the SLT region
In this section we show that C-optimal bounds based on SLT-optimality for a given graph can be
applied to any of its subgraphs.
Proposition 3. Let G = (cid:104)V  E(cid:105) be a graphical model and C the SLT-region of G. Let G(cid:48) = (cid:104)V (cid:48)  E(cid:48)(cid:105)
be a subgraph of G. Then the bound of equation 3 for G holds for any SLT-optimal assignment in G(cid:48).
Sketch of the proof. We can compose a region C(cid:48) containing the same elements as C but removing
those variables which are not contained in V (cid:48). Note that SLT-optimality on G(cid:48) guarantees optimality
in each element of C(cid:48). Observe that the bound obtained by applying equation 3 to C(cid:48) is greater or
equal than the bound obtained for C. Hence  the bound for G applies also to G(cid:48).
A direct conclusion of proposition 3 is that any bound based on the SLT-region of a complete graph
of n variables can be directly applied to any subgraph of n or fewer variables regardless of its
structure. In what follows we assess the bound for a complete graph.
Proposition 4. Let G = (cid:104)V  E(cid:105) be a complete MRF. For any max-sum ﬁxed point assignment xM S 
(7)

θ(xM S) ≥

· θ(x∗).

1

|V | − 2

Proof. Let C be a region containing every possible combination of three variables in V . Every set of
three variables is part of the SLT-region because it can contain at most one cycle. The development
in the proof of proposition 2 can be applied here for k = 3 to obtain equation 7.
Corollary 5. For any MRF  any max-sum ﬁxed point assignment xM S satisﬁes equation 7.

Since any graph can be seen as a subgraph of the complete graph with the same number of vari-
ables  the corollary is straightforward given propositions 3 and 4. Figure 2(a) plots this structure-
independent bound when varying the number of variables. Observe that it rapidly decreases with

the number of variables and it is only signiﬁcant on very small MRFs. In the next section  we show
how to exploit the knowledge of the structure of an MRF to improve the bound’s signiﬁcance.

4.2 SLT-bounds for speciﬁc MRF structures and independent of the MRF parameters

In this section we show that for MRFs with speciﬁc structures  it is possible to provide bounds much
tighter than the structure-independent bound provided by corollary 5. These structures include  but
are not limited to  bipartite graphs  2-D grids  and variable-disjoint cycle graphs.

4.2.1 Bipartite graphs
In this section we deﬁne the C-optimal bound of equation 3 for any max-sum ﬁxed point assignment
in an n-m bipartite MRF. An n-m bipartite MRF is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two
disjoint sets  one with n variables and another one with m variables  such that the n variables in the
ﬁrst set are connected to the m variables in the second set. Figure 3(a) depicts a 3-3 bipartite MRF.
Proposition 6. For any MRF with n-m bipartite structure where m ≥ n  and for any max-sum ﬁxed
point assignment xM S we have that:

(cid:40) 1

θ(xM S) ≥ b(n  m) · θ(x∗)

b(n  m) =

m ≥ n + 3
n
n+m−2 m < n + 3

(8)

Proof. Let CA be a region including one out of the n variables and all of the m variables (in ﬁgure
3  elements (n)-(p)). Since the elements of this region are trees  we can guarantee optimality on
them. The number of elements of the region is |CA| = n. It is clear that each edge in the graph
is completely covered by one of the elements of CA  and hence cc∗ = 1. Furthermore  every edge
is partially covered  since all of the m variables are present in every element  and hence nc∗ = 0.
Applying equation 3 gives the bound 1/n.
Alternatively  we can deﬁne a region CB formed by taking sets of four variables  two from each set.
Since the elements of CB are single-cycle graphs (in ﬁgure 3  elements (b)-(j))  we can guarantee
optimality on them. Applying proposition 1  we obtain the bound
n+m−2 >
n when m < n + 3  and so equation 8 holds (details can be found in the additional material).
1
Example 1. Consider the 3-3 bipartite MRF of ﬁgure 3(a). Figures 3(b)-(j) show the elements in
the region CB composed of sets of four variables  two from each side. Therefore |CB| is 9. Then  for
any edge S ∈ E there are 4 sets in CB that contain its two variables. For example  the edge that
links the upper left variable (x0) and the upper right variable (x3) is included in the subgraphs of
ﬁgures 3(b)  (c)  (e) and (f). Moreover  for any edge S ∈ E there is a single element in CB that does
not cover it at all. For example  the only graph that does not include neither x0 nor x3 is the graph
of ﬁgure 3(j). Thus  the bound is 4/(9 − 1) = 1/2.
Figure 2(a) plots the bound of equation 8 for bipartite graphs when varying the number of variables.
Note that although  also in this case  the value of the bound rapidly decreases with the number of
variables  it is two times the values of the structure-independent bound (see equation 7).

4.2.2 Two-dimensional (2-D) grids

where each variable has 4 neighbours. Figure 4 (a) depicts a 4-grid MRF.

Proof. We can partition columns in pairs joining column 1 with column (n/2) + 1  column 2 with
column (n/2) + 2 and so on. We can partition rows in the same way. Let C be a region where
each element contains the vertices in a pair of rows at distance n
2 together with those in a pair of
2 . Note that optimality is guaranteed in each C α ∈ C because variables in two
columns at distance n
non-consecutive rows and two non-consecutive columns create a single-cycle graph. Since we take
every possible combination  |C| = ( n
2 elements and hence
2 − 2) elements of C that do not cover
cc∗ = n
S at all. Substituting these values into equation 3 leads to equation 9.

2 . Finally2  for each edge S  there are nc∗ = ( n

2 )2. Each edge is completely covered by n

2 − 1)( n

Example 2. Consider the 4-grid MRF of ﬁgure 4 (a). Figures 4 (b)-(e) show the vertex-induced
subgraphs for each set of vertices in the region C formed by the combination of any pairs of rows in
{(1  3)  (2  4)} and pair of columns in {(1  3)  (2  4)}. Therefore |C| = 4. Then  for any edge S ∈ E
there are 2 sets that contain its two variables. For example  the edge that links the two ﬁrst variables
in the ﬁrst row  namely x0 and x1  is included in the subgraphs of ﬁgures (a) and (b). Moreover  for
any edge S ∈ E there is no set that contains no variable from S. Thus  the bound is 1/2.

Figure 2(a) plots the bound for 2-D grids when varying the number of variables. Note that when
compared with the bound for complete and bipartite structures  the bound for 2-D grids decreases
smoothly and tends to stabilize as the number of variables increases. In fact  observe that by equation
9  the bound for 2-D grids is never less that 1/3 independently of the grid size.

4.2.3 MRFs that are a union of variable-disjoint cycles

In this section we assess a bound for MRFs composed of a set of variable-disjoint cycles  namely of
cycles that do not share any variable.
A common pattern shared by the bounds assessed so far is that they decrease as the number of vari-
ables of an MRF grows. This section provides an example showing that there are speciﬁc structures
for which C-optimality obtains signiﬁcant bounds for large MRFs.
Example 3. Consider the MRF composed of two variable-disjoint cycles of size 4 depicted in ﬁg-
ure 5(a). To create the region  we remove each of the variables of the ﬁrst cycle  one at a time (see
ﬁgures 5(b)-(e)). We act analogously with the second cycle. Hence  C is composed of 8 elements.
Just by counting we observe that each edge is completely covered 6 times  so cc∗ = 6. Since we are
removing a single variable at a time  nc∗ = 0. Hence  the bound for a max-sum ﬁxed point in this
MRF structure is 6/8 = 3/4.

The following result generalizes the previous example to MRFs containing d variable-disjoint cycles
of size larger or equal to l.
Proposition 8. For any MRF such that every pair of cycles is variable-disjoint and where there are
at most d cycles of size l or larger  and for any max-sum ﬁxed point assignment xM S  we have that:

θ(xM S) ≥

1 − 2(d − 1)
d · l

· θ(x∗) =

(l − 2) · d + 2

l · d

· θ(x∗).

Figure 5: (a) 2 variable-disjoint cycles MRF of size 4 and (b-e) sets of variables covered by the SLT-region.

The proof generalizes the region explained in example 3 to any variable-disjoint cycle MRF by
deﬁning a region that includes an element for every possible edge removal from every cycle but one.
The proof is omitted here due to lack of space but can be consulted in the additional material.
Equation 10 shows that the bound: (i) decreases with the number of cycles; and (ii) increases as the
maximum number of variables in each cycle grows. Figure 2(b) illustrates the relationship between
the bound  the number of cycles (d)  and the maximum size of the cycles (l). The ﬁrst thing we
observe is that the size of the cycles has more impact on the bound than the number of cycles. In
fact  observe that by equation 10  the bound for a variable-disjoint cycle graph with a maximum
cycle size of l is at least (l−2)
  independently of the number of cycles. Thus  if the minimum size of
a cycle is 20  the quality for a ﬁxed point is guaranteed to be at least 90%. Hence  quality guarantees
for max-sum ﬁxed points are good whenever: (i) the cycles in the MRF do not share any variables;
and (ii) the smallest cycle in the MRF is large. Therefore  our result conﬁrms and reﬁnes the recent
results obtained for single-cycle MRFs [11].

4.3 SLT-bounds for arbitrary MRF structures and independent of the MRF parameters

In this section we discuss how to assess tight SLT-bounds for any arbitrary MRF structure. Similarly
to [18  20]  we can use linear fractional programming (LFP) to compute the structure speciﬁc SLT
bounds in any MRF with arbitrary structure. Let C be a region for all subsets in the SLT region
of the graphical model G = (cid:104)V  E(cid:105) of an MRF. For each S ∈ E  the LFP contains two LFP
variables that represents the value of the edge S for the SLT-optimum  xM S  and for the MAP
such that for all Cα ∈ C 
assignment  x∗. The objective of the LFP is to minimize
θ(xM S) − θ(xα) ≥ 0. Following [18  20]  for each Cα ∈ C  θ(xα) can be expressed in terms of
the value of the potentials for xM S and x∗. Then  the optimal value of this LFP is a tight bound
for any MRF with the given speciﬁc structure. Indeed  the solution of the LFP provides the values
of potentials for xM S and x∗ that produce the worst-case MRF whose SLT-optimum has the lowest
value with respect to the optimum. However  because this method requires to list all the sets in
the SLT-region  the complexity of generating an LFP increases exponentially with the number of
variables in the MRF. Therefore  although this method provides more ﬂexibility to deal with any
arbitrary structure  its computational cost does not scale with the size of MRFs in contrast with the
structure speciﬁc SLT-bounds of section 4.2  that are assessed in constant time.

5 Conclusions

We provided worst-case bounds on the quality of any max-product ﬁxed point. With this aim  we
have introduced C-optimality  which has proven a valuable tool to bound the quality of max-product
ﬁxed points. Concretely  we have proven that independently of an MRF structure  max-product has
a quality guarantee that decreases with the number of variables of the MRF. Furthermore  our results
allow to identify new classes of MRF structures  besides acyclic and single-cycle  for which we
can provide theoretical guarantees on the quality of max-product assignments. As an example  we
deﬁned signiﬁcant bounds for 2-D grids and MRFs with variable-disjoint cycles.
