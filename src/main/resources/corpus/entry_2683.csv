Abstract

Conventional dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are based on the homogeneous
Markov assumption  which is too restrictive in many practical applications. Vari-
ous approaches to relax the homogeneity assumption have recently been proposed 
allowing the network structure to change with time. However  unless time series
are very long  this ﬂexibility leads to the risk of overﬁtting and inﬂated infer-
ence uncertainty. In the present paper we investigate three regularization schemes
based on inter-segment information sharing  choosing different prior distributions
and different coupling schemes between nodes. We apply our method to gene ex-
pression time series obtained during the Drosophila life cycle  and compare the
predicted segmentation with other state-of-the-art techniques. We conclude our
evaluation with an application to synthetic biology  where the objective is to pre-
dict a known in vivo regulatory network of ﬁve genes in yeast.

Introduction

1
There is currently considerable interest in structure learning of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) 
with a variety of applications in signal processing and computational biology; see e.g. [1  2  3]. The
standard assumption underlying DBNs is that time-series have been generated from a homogeneous
Markov process. This assumption is too restrictive in many applications and can potentially lead to
erroneous conclusions. While there have been various efforts to relax the homogeneity assumption
for undirected graphical models [4  5]  relaxing this restriction in DBNs is a more recent research
topic [1  2  3  6  7  8]. At present  none of the proposed methods is without its limitations  leav-
ing room for further methodological innovation. The method proposed in [3  8] is non-Bayesian.
This requires certain regularization parameters to be optimized “externally”  by applying informa-
tion criteria (like AIC or BIC)  cross-validation or bootstrapping. The ﬁrst approach is suboptimal 
the latter approaches are computationally expensive1. In the present paper we therefore follow the
Bayesian paradigm  like [1  2  6  7]. These approaches also have their limitations. The method
proposed in [2] assumes a ﬁxed network structure and only allows the interaction parameters to vary
with time. This assumption is too rigid when looking at processes where changes in the overall
regulatory network structure are expected  e.g. in morphogenesis or embryogenesis. The method
proposed in [1] requires a discretization of the data  which incurs an inevitable information loss.
These limitations are addressed in [6  7]  where the authors propose a method for continuous data
that allows network structures associated with different nodes to change with time in different ways.
However  this high ﬂexibility causes potential problems when applied to time series with a low num-
ber of measurements  as typically available from systems biology  leading to overﬁtting or inﬂated

inference uncertainty. The objective of the work described in our paper is to propose a model that
addresses the principled shortcomings of the three Bayesian methods mentioned above. Unlike [1] 
our model is continuous and therefore avoids the information loss inherent in a discretization of the
data. Unlike [2]  our model allows the network structure to change among segments  leading to
greater model ﬂexibility. As an improvement on [6  7]  our model introduces information sharing
among time series segments  which provides an essential regularization effect.

2 Background: non-homogeneous DBNs without information coupling
This section summarizes brieﬂy the non-homogeneous DBN proposed in [6  7]  which combines
the Bayesian regression model of [10] with multiple changepoint processes and pursues Bayesian
inference with reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) [11]. In what follows  we
will refer to nodes as genes and to the network as a gene regulatory network. The method is not
restricted to molecular systems biology  though.

i   where ξi = (ξ0

2.1 Model
Multiple changepoints: Let p be the number of observed genes  whose expression values y =
{yi(t)}1≤i≤p 1≤t≤N are measured at N time points. M represents a directed graph  i.e. the network
deﬁned by a set of directed edges among the p genes. Mi is the subnetwork associated with target
gene i  determined by the set of its parents (nodes with a directed edge feeding into gene i). The
regulatory relationships among the genes  deﬁned by M  may vary across time  which we model
with a multiple changepoint process. For each target gene i  an unknown number ki of changepoints
deﬁne ki + 1 non-overlapping segments. Segment h = 1  ..  ki + 1 starts at changepoint ξh−1
and
i . To delimit the bounds  ξ0
stops before ξh
i = 2
= N + 1. Thus vector ξi has length |ξi| = ki + 2. The set of changepoints is denoted by ξ =
and ξki+1
{ξi}1≤i≤p. This changepoint process induces a partition of the time series  yh
  with
different structures Mh
i associated with the different segments h ∈ {1  . . .   ki + 1}. Identiﬁability is
satisﬁed by ordering the changepoints based on their position in the time series.
Regression model: For all genes i  the random variable Yi(t) refers to the expression of gene i at
time t. Within any segment h  the expression of gene i depends on the p gene expression values

2.2 Prior
The ki + 1 segments are delimited by ki changepoints  where ki is distributed a priori as a truncated
Poisson random variable with mean λ and maximum k = N −2: P (ki|λ) ∝ λki
ki! 1l{ki≤k} . Conditional
on ki changepoints  the changepoint positions vector ξi = (ξ0
) takes non-overlapping
integer values  which we take to be uniformly distributed a priori. There are (N − 2) possible posi-
tions for the ki changepoints  thus vector ξi has prior density P (ξi|ki) = 1/“N −2
ki”. For all genes i
i of parents for node i follows a truncated Poisson distribution2 with
and all segments h  the number sh

drawn from vague conjugate hyperpriors  which are in the (inverse) gamma distribution family:

An attractive feature of the chosen model is that the marginalization over the parameters a and σ in
the posterior distribution of (5) is analytically tractable:

P (k ξ M λ Λ δ2|y) = Z P (k ξ M a σ λ Λ δ2|y)dadσ

(6)

See [6  10] for details and an explicit expression. The number of changepoints and their location 
k  ξ  the network structure M and the hyperparameters λ  Λ  δ2 can be sampled from the posterior
P (k  ξ  M  λ  Λ  δ2|y) with RJMCMC [11]. A detailed description can be found in [6  10].

3 Model improvement: information coupling between segments
Allowing the network structure to change between segments leads to a highly ﬂexible model. How-
ever  this approach faces a conceptual and a practical problem. The practical problem is potential
model over-ﬂexibility. If subsequent changepoints are close together  network structures have to be
inferred from short time series segments. This will almost inevitably lead to overﬁtting (in a maxi-
mum likelihood context) or inﬂated inference uncertainty (in a Bayesian context). The conceptual
problem is the underlying assumption that structures associated with different segments are a priori
independent. This is not realistic. For instance  for the evolution of a gene regulatory network during
embryogenesis  we would assume that the network evolves gradually and that networks associated
with adjacent time intervals are a priori similar.

To address these problems  we propose three methods of information sharing among time series
segments  as illustrated in Figure 1. The ﬁrst method is based on hard information coupling between
the nodes  using the exponential distribution proposed in [13]. The second scheme is also based
on hard information coupling  but uses a binomial distribution with conjugate Beta prior. The third
scheme is based on the same distributional assumptions as the second scheme  but replaces the hard
by a soft information coupling scheme.

Θ = β  Ψ = [0  10]  and no Ω  and Section 3.2  with Θ = {a  b}  Ψ = {α  α  γ  γ}  and Ω = [0  20]. 1(b):

The methods described in this paper have been implemented in R  based on code from [6  7]. Our
program sets up an RJMCMC simulation to sample the network structure  the changepoints and
the hyperparameters from the posterior distribution. As a convergence diagnostic we monitor the
potential scale reduction factor (PSRF) [14]  computed from the within-chain and between-chain
variances of marginal edge posterior probabilities. Values of PSRF≤1.1 are usually taken as indi-
cation of sufﬁcient convergence. In our simulations  we extended the burn-in phase until a value of

vals of 200 RJMCMC steps. From these samples we compute the marginal posterior probabilities
of all potential interactions  which deﬁnes a ranking of the edges in the recovered network. When
the true network is known  this allows us to construct the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
curve (plotting the sensitivity or recall against the complementary speciﬁcity) and the precision-
recall (PR) curve (plotting the precision against the recall)  and to assess the network reconstruction
accuracy in terms of the areas under these graphs (AUROC and AUPRC  respectively); see [15].

4.1 Comparative evaluation on simulated data
We randomly generated 10 networks with 10 nodes each  with the number of parents per node drawn
from a Poisson distribution with mean λ = 3. To simulate changes in the network structure  we cre-
ated 4 different network segments by drawing the number of changes from a Poisson distribution
and applying the changes uniformly at random to edges and non-edges in the previous segment. For
each segment  we generated a time series of length 15 using a linear regression model. The regres-
sion weights were drawn from a Gaussian N (0  1)  and Gaussian observation noise N (0  1) was
added. We compared the network reconstruction accuracy of the non-homogeneous DBN without
information sharing proposed in [6  7] (HetDBN-0) with the three information sharing approaches 
based on the exponential prior from Section 3.1 (HetDBN-Exp)  the binomial prior with hard node
coupling from Section 3.2 (HetDBN-Bino1)  and the binomial prior with soft node coupling from
Section 3.3 (HetDBN-Bino2). Figures 2(a) and 2(b) shows the network reconstruction performance
of the different information sharing methods in terms of AUROC and AUPRC scores. All infor-
mation sharing methods show a clear improvement in network reconstruction over HetDBN-0  as
conﬁrmed by paired t-tests (p < 0.01). We investigated two different situations  the case where all
segment structures are the same (although edge weights are allowed to vary) and the case where
changes are applied sequentially to the segments3. Information sharing is most beneﬁcial for the
ﬁrst case  but even when we introduce changes we still see an increase in the network reconstruction
scores compared to HetDBN-0. When all segments are the same  HetDBN-Bino1 and HetDBN-
Bino2 outperform HetDBN-Exp (p < 0.05)  but there is no signiﬁcant difference between the two
binomial methods. Paired t-tests showed that all other differences in mean are signiﬁcant. When the
segments are different  all information sharing methods outperform HetDBN-0 (p < 0.05)  but the
difference between the information sharing methods is not signiﬁcant.

4.2 Morphogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster
We applied our methods to a gene expression time series for eleven genes involved in the muscle
development of Drosophila melanogaster [16]. The microarray data measured gene expression lev-
els during all four major stages of morphogenesis: embryo  larva  pupa and adult. We investigated
whether our methods were able to infer the correct changepoints corresponding to the known transi-
tions between stages. Figure 3(a) shows the posterior probabilities of inferred changepoints for any
gene using HetDBN-0  while Figure 3(c) shows the posterior probabilities for the information shar-

3We chose to draw the number of changes from a Poisson with mean 1 for each node.

ing methods. For comparison  we applied the method proposed in [3]  using the authors’ software
package TESLA (Figure 3(b)). Robinson and Hartemink applied the discrete non-homogeneous
DBN in [1] to the same data set  and a plot corresponding to Figure 3(b) can be found in their paper.

Our non-homogeneous DBN methods are generally more successful than TESLA  in that they re-
cover changepoints for all three transitions (embryo → larva  larva → pupa  and pupa → adult).
Figure 3(b) indicates that the last transition  pupa → adult  is less clearly detected with TESLA 
and it is completely missing in [1]. Both our method as well as TESLA detect additional transitions
during the embryo stage  which are missing in [1]. We would argue that a complex gene regulatory
network is unlikely to transition into a new morphogenic phase all at once  and some pathways might
have to undergo activational changes earlier in preparation for the morphogenic transition. As such 
it is not implausible that additional transitions at the gene regulatory network level occur. However 
a failure to detect known morphogenic transitions can clearly be seen as a shortcoming of a method 
and on these grounds our model appears to outperform the two alternative ones. We note that the
main effect of information sharing is to reduce the size of the smaller peaks  while keeping the three
most salient peaks (corresponding to larva → pupa  and pupa → adult  and an extra transition in the
embryo phase). This reﬂects the fact that these changepoints are associated with signiﬁcant changes
in network structure  and adds to the interpretability of the results. The drawback is that the third
morphological transition (embryo → larva) is less pronounced.

4.3 Reconstruction of a synthetic gene regulatory network in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
The highly topical ﬁeld of synthetic biology enables biologists to design known gene regulatory
networks in living cells. In the work described in [17]  a synthetic regulatory network of 5 genes was
constructed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast)  and gene expression time series were measured
with RT-PCR for 16 and 21 time points under two experimental conditions  related to the carbon
source: galactose (“switch on”) and glucose (“switch off”). The authors tried to reconstruct the
known gold-standard network from these time series with two established state-of-the-art methods
from computational systems biology  one based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs)  called

Figure 4: Reconstruction of a known gene regulatory network from synthetic biology in yeast.
The network was reconstructed from two gene expression time series obtained with RT-PCR in
two experimental conditions  reﬂecting the switch in the carbon source from galactose (“switch
on”) to glucose (“switch off”). The reconstruction accuracy of the methods proposed in Section 3 
where the legend is explained  is shown in terms of precision (vertical axis) - recall (horizontal
axis) curves. Results were averaged over 10 independent MCMC simulations. For comparison 
ﬁxed precision/recall scores are shown for two state-of-the-art methods reported in [17]: Banjo  a
conventional DBN  and TSNI  a method based on ODEs.

TSNI  the other based on conventional DBNs  called Banjo; see [17] for details. Both methods
are optimization-based and output a single network. By comparison with the known gold standard 
the authors obtained the precision (proportion of predicted interactions that are correct) and recall
(proportion of predicted true interactions) scores. In our study  we merged the time series from
the two experimental conditions under exclusion of the boundary point4  and applied the four non-
homogeneous DBNs described before. Figure 3(d) shows the inferred marginal posterior probability
of potential changepoints. The most signiﬁcant changepoint is at the boundary between “switch
on” and “switch off” data  conﬁrming that the known true changepoint is consistently identiﬁed.
The biological mechanism behind the other peaks is not known  and they are potentially spurious.
Interestingly  the application of the proposed information-coupling schemes reduces the height of
these peaks  with the binomial models having a stronger effect than the exponential one.

As we pursue a Bayesian inference scheme  we also obtain a ranking of the potential gene interac-
tions in terms of their marginal posterior probabilities. From this we computed the precision-recall
curves [15] shown in Figure 4. Our non-homogeneous DBNs with information sharing outperform
Banjo and TSNI both in the “switch on” and the “switch off” phase. They also perform better than
HetDBN-0 on the “switch off” data  but are slightly worse on the “switch on” data. Note that the
reconstruction accuracy on the “switch off” data is generally poorer than on the “switch on” data
[17]. Our results are thus plausible  suggesting that information sharing boosts the reconstruction
accuracy on the poorer time series segment at the cost of a degraded performance on the stronger
one. This effect is more pronounced for the exponential prior than for the binomial one  indicating
a tighter coupling. The average areas under the PR curves  averaged over both phases (“switch on
and off”)  are as follows. HetDBN-0= 0.70  HetDBN-Exp= 0.77  HetDBN-Bino1= 0.75  HetDBN-
Bino2= 0.75. Hence  the overall effect of information sharing is a performance improvement.

5 Conclusions
We have described a non-homogeneous DBN  which has various advantages over existing schemes:
it does not require the data to be discretized (as opposed to [1]); it allows the network structure
to change with time (as opposed to [2]); it includes three different regularization schemes based on
inter-time segment information sharing (as opposed to [6  7]); and it allows all hyperparameters to be
inferred from the data via a consistent Bayesian inference scheme (as opposed to [3]). An evaluation
on simulated data has demonstrated an improved performance over [6  7] when information sharing
is introduced. The application of our method to gene expression time series taken during the life cy-
cle of Drosophila melanogaster has revealed better agreement with known morphogenic transitions
than the methods of [1] and [3]. We have carried out a comparative evaluation of different informa-
tion coupling schemes: a binomial versus an exponential prior  and hard versus soft coupling. In an
application to data from a topical study in synthetic biology  our methods have outperformed two
established network reconstruction methods from computational systems biology.

4When merging two time series (x1  . . .   xm) and (y1  . . .   yn)  only the pairs xi → xj and yi → yj are

presented to the DBN  while the pair xm → y1 is excluded due to the obvious discontinuity.
