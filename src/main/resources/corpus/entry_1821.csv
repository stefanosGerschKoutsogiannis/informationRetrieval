Abstract

Most action potentials in the nervous system take on the form of strong  rapid  and
brief voltage deﬂections known as spikes  in stark contrast to other action poten-
tials  such as in the heart  that are characterized by broad voltage plateaus. We
derive the shape of the neuronal action potential from ﬁrst principles  by postulat-
ing that action potential generation is strongly constrained by the brain’s need to
minimize energy expenditure. For a given height of an action potential  the least
energy is consumed when the underlying currents obey the bang-bang principle:
the currents giving rise to the spike should be intense  yet short-lived  yielding
spikes with sharp onsets and offsets. Energy optimality predicts features in the
biophysics that are not per se required for producing the characteristic neuronal
action potential: sodium currents should be extraordinarily powerful and inacti-
vate with voltage; both potassium and sodium currents should have kinetics that
have a bell-shaped voltage-dependence; and the cooperative action of multiple
‘gates’ should start the ﬂow of current.

1 The paradox

∆E = RTV(cid:88)

α

Nerve cells communicate with each other over long distances using spike-like action potentials 
which are brief electrical events traveling rapidly down axons and dendrites. Each action potential is
caused by an accelerating inﬂux of sodium or calcium ions  depolarizing the cell membrane by forty
millivolts or more  followed by repolarization of the cell membrane caused by an efﬂux of potassium
ions. As different species of ions are swapped across the membrane during the action potential  ion
pumps shuttle the excess ions back and restore the ionic concentration gradients.
If we label each ionic species by α  the work ∆E done to restore the ionic concentration gradients
is

[α]out
[α]in

 

∆[α]in ln

where R is the gas constant  T is the temperature in Kelvin  V is the cell volume  [α]in|out is the
concentration of ion α inside or outside the cell  and ∆[α]in is the concentration change inside the
α zα∆[α] = 0 
where zα is the charge on ion α  as no net charge accumulates during the action potential and no
net work is done by or on the electric ﬁeld. Often  sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) play the
dominant role in generating action potentials  in which case ∆E = ∆[Na]inFV(ENa − EK)  where

no net sodium current ﬂows  and EK = RT /F ln(cid:0)[K]out/[K]in

(cid:1). This estimate of the work done

does not include heat (due to loss through the membrane resistance) or the work done by the ion
channel proteins in changing their conformational state during the action potential.
Hence  the action potential’s energetic cost to the cell is directly proportional to ∆[Na]in; taking
into account that each Na+ ion carries one elementary charge  the cost is also proportional to the

1

charge QNa that accumulates inside the cell. A maximally efﬁcient cell reduces the charge per spike
to a minimum. If a cell ﬁres action potentials at an average rate f  the cell’s Na/K pumps must
move Na+ and K+ ions in opposite directions  against their respective concentration gradients  to
counteract an average inward Na+ current of f QNa. Exhaustive measurements on myocytes in the
heart  which expend tremendous amounts of energy to keep the heart beating  indicate that Na/K
pumps expel ∼ 0.5 µA/cm2 of Na+ current at membrane potentials close to rest [1]. Most excitable
cells  even when spiking  spend most of their time close to resting potential  and yet standard models
for action potentials can easily lead to accumulating an ionic charge of up to 5 µC/cm2 [2]; most of
this accumulation occurs during a very brief time interval. If one were to take an isopotential nerve
cell with the same density of ion pumps as in the heart  then such a cell would not be able to produce
more than an action potential once every ten seconds on average. The brain should be effectively
silent.
Clearly  this conﬂicts with what is known about the average ﬁring rates of neurons in the brainstem
or even the neocortex  which can sustain spiking up to at least 7 Hz [3]. Part of the discrepancy can
be resolved by noting that nerve cells are not isopotential and that action potential generation occurs
within a highly restricted area of the membrane. Even so  standard models of action potential gener-
ation waste extraordinary amounts of energy; recent evidence [4] points out that many mammalian
cortical neurons are much more efﬁcient.
As nature places a premium on energy consumption  we will argue that one can predict both the
shape of the action potential and the underlying biophysics of the nonlinear  voltage-dependent
ionic conductances from the principle of minimal energy consumption. After reviewing the ionic
basis of action potentials  we ﬁrst sketch how to compute the minimal energy cost for an arbitrary
spike shape  and then solve for the optimal action potential shape with a given height. Finally  we
show how minimal energy consumption explains all the dynamical features in the standard Hodgkin-
Huxley (HH) model for neuronal dynamics that distinguish the brain’s action potentials from other
highly nonlinear oscillations in physics and chemistry.

Ionic basis of the action potential

In an excitable cell  synaptic drive forces the membrane permeability to different ions to change
rapidly in time  producing the dynamics of the action potential. The current density Iα carried by
an ion species α is given by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) current equation[5  6  2]  which
assumes that ions are driven independently across the membrane under the inﬂuence of a constant
electric ﬁeld. Iα depends upon the ions membrane permeability  Pα  its concentrations on either
side of the membrane [α]out and [α]in and the voltage across the membrane  V   according to:

Iα = Pα

αV F 2
z2
RT

[α]out − [α]in exp (zαV F/RT )

1 − exp(zαV F/RT )

 

(2)

To produce the fast currents that generate APs  a subset of the membranes ionic permeabilities Pα are
gated by voltage. Changes in the permeability Pα are not instantaneous; the voltage-gated perme-
ability is scaled mathematically by gating variables m(t) and h(t) with their own time dependence.
After separating constant from time-dependent components in the permeability  the voltage-gated
permeability obeys

Pα(t) = m(t)rh(t)s

such that

0 ≤ Pα(t) ≤ ¯Pα 

where r and s are positive  and ¯Pα is the peak permeability to ion α when all channels for ion α are
open. Gating is also referred to as activation  and the associated nonlinear permeabilities are called
active. There are also passive  voltage-insensitive permeabilities that maintain the resting potential
and depolarise the membrane to trigger action potentials.
The simplest possible kinetics for the gating variables are ﬁrst order  involving only a single deriva-
tive in time. The steady state of each gating variable at a given voltage is determined by a Boltzmann
function  to which the gating variables evolve:

m∞(V ) by the rth root of the peak permeability ¯Pα is a matter of mathematical convenience.
We will consider both voltage-independent and voltage-dependent time constants  either setting τj =
τj 0 to be constant  where j ∈ {m(t)  h(t)}  or imposing a bell-shaped voltage dependence τj(V ) =

3 Resistive and capacitive components of the energy cost

By treating the action potential as the charging and discharging of the cell membrane capacitance 
the action potentials measured at the mossy ﬁbre synapse in rats [4] or in mouse thalamocortical
neurons [7] were found to be highly energy-efﬁcient: the nonlinear  active conductances inject only
slightly more current than is needed to charge a capacitor to the peak voltage of the action poten-
tial. The implicit assumption made here is that one can neglect the passive loss of current through
the membrane resistance  known as the leak. Any passive loss must be compensated by additional
charge  making this loss the primary target of the selection pressure that has shaped the dynamics
of action potentials. On the other hand  the membrane capacitance at the site of AP initiation is
generally modelled and experimentally conﬁrmed [8] as being fairly constant around 1 µF/cm2; in
contrast  the propagation  but not generation  of AP’s can be assisted by a reduction in the capac-
itance achieved by the myelin sheath that wraps some axons. As myelin would block the ﬂow of
ions  we posit that the speciﬁc capacitance cannot yield to selection pressure to minimise the work
W = QNa(ENa − EK) needed for AP generation.
To address how the shape and dynamics of action potentials might have evolved to consume less
energy  we ﬁrst ﬁx the action potential’s shape and solve for the minimum charge QNa ab initio 
without treating the cell membrane as a pure capacitor. Regardless of the action potential’s partic-
ular time-course V (t)  voltage-dependent ionic conductances must transfer Na+ and K+ charge to
elicit an action potential. Figure 1 shows a generic action potential and the associated ionic currents 
comparing the latter to the minimal currents required. The passive equivalent circuit for the neuron
consists of a resistor in parallel with a capacitor  driven by a synaptic current. To charge the mem-
brane to the peak voltage  a neuron in a high-conductance state [9  10] may well lose more charge
through the resistor than is stored on the capacitor. For neurons in a low-conductance state and
for rapid voltage deﬂections from the resting potential  membrane capacitance will be the primary
determinant of the charge.

4 The norm of spikes

How close can voltage-gated channels with realistic properties come to the minimal currents? What
time-course for the action potential leads to the smallest minimal currents?
To answer these questions  we must solve a constrained optimization problem on the solutions to the
nonlinear differential equations for the neuronal dynamics. To separate action potentials from mere
small-amplitude oscillations in the voltage  we need to introduce a metric. Smaller action potentials
consume less energy  provided the underlying currents are optimal  yet signalling between neurons
depends on the action potential’s voltage deﬂection reaching a minimum amplitude. Given the
importance of the action potential’s amplitude  we deﬁne an Lp norm on the voltage wave-form
V (t) to emphasize the maximal voltage deﬂection:

(cid:107)V (t) − (cid:104)V (cid:105)(cid:107)p =

(cid:107)V (t) − (cid:104)V (cid:105)(cid:107)p dt

tential is ∼ 50 mV above the average potential.
(b) The inward Na+ current  shown in green
going in the negative direction  rapidly depolarizes the potential V (t) and yields the upstroke of
the action potential. Concurrently  the K+ current activates  displayed as a positive deﬂection 
and leads to the downstroke in the potential V (t). Inward and outward currents overlap signiﬁ-
cantly in time. The dotted lines within the region bounded by the solid lines represent the minimal
Na+ current and the minimal K+ current needed to produce the V (t) spike waveform in (a). By
the law of current conservation  the sum of capacitive  resistive  and synaptic currents  denoted by
LV (t) ≡ C ˙V (t) + Ileak[V (t)] + Isyn[V (t)]  must be balanced by the active currents. If the cell’s
passive properties  namely its capacitance and (leak) resistance  and the synaptic conductance are
constant  we can deduce the minimal active currents needed to generate a speciﬁed V (t). The mini-
mal currents  by deﬁnition  do not overlap in time. Taking into account passive current ﬂow  restoring
the concentration gradients after the action potential requires 29 nJ/cm2. By contrast  if the active
currents were optimal  the cost would be 8.9 nJ/cm2. (c) To depolarize from the minimum to the
maximum of the AP  the synaptic voltage-gated currents must deliver a charge Qcapacitive to charge
the membrane capacitance and a charge Qresistive to compensate for the loss of current through leak
channels. For a large leak conductance in the cell membrane  Qresistive can be larger than Qcapacitive.

In the limit as p → ∞  the norm simply becomes the difference
between the action potential’s peak voltage and the mean voltage  whereas a ﬁnite p ensures that
the norm is differentiable. In parameter space  we will focus our attention to the manifold of action
potentials with constant Lp norm with 2 (cid:28) p < ∞  which entails that the optimal action potential
will have a ﬁnite  though possibly narrow width. To be close to the supremum norm  yet still have a
norm that is well-behaved under differentiation  we decided to use p = 16.

5 Poincar´e-Lindstedt perturbation of periodic dynamical orbits

Standard (secular) perturbation theory diverges for periodic orbits  so we apply the Poincar-
Lindstedt technique of expanding both in the period and the dynamics of the asymptotic orbit and
then derive a set of adjoint sensitivity equations for the differential-algebraic system. Solving once
for the adjoint functions  we can easily compute the parameter gradient of any functional on the
orbit  even for thousands of parameters.
We start with a set of ordinary differential equations ˙x = F(x; p) for the neuron’s dynamics  an
asymptotically periodic orbit xγ(t) that describes the action potential  and a functional G(x; p) on
the orbit  representing the energy consumption  for instance. The functional can be written as an
integral

(cid:90) ω(p)−1

G(xγ; p) =

g(xγ(t); p) dt 

0

over some source term g(xγ(t); p). Assume that locally perturbing a parameter p ∈ p induces a
smooth change in the stable limit cycle  preserving its existence. Generally  a perturbation changes
not only the limit cycle’s path in state space  but also the average speed with which this orbit is
traversed; as a consequence  the value of the functional depends on this change in speed  to lowest
order. For simplicity  consider a single  scalar parameter p. G(xγ; p) is the solution to

where we have normalised time via τ = ω(p)t. Denoting partial derivatives by subscripts  we

ω(p)∂τ [G(xγ; p)] = g(xγ; p)

The ﬁrst term in the integral gives rise to the partial derivative ∂G(xγ; p)/ ∂p. In many cases  this
term is either zero  can be made zero  or at least made independent of the dynamical variables.
The parameters for the neuron models are listed in Table 1 together with their minimum and maxi-
mum allowed values.
For each parameter in the neuron model  an auxiliary parameter on the entire real line is introduced 
and a mapping from the real line onto the ﬁnite range set by the biophysical limits is deﬁned. Gradi-
ent descent on this auxiliary parameter space is performed by orthogonalizing the gradient dQα/dp
to the gradient dL/dp of the norm. To correct for drift off the constraint manifold of constant norm 
illustrated in Fig. 3  steps of gradient ascent or descent on the Lp norm are performed while keeping
Qα constant. The step size during gradient descent is adjusted to assure that ∆Qα < 0 and that a
periodic solution xγ exists after adapting the parameters. The energy landscape is locally convex
(Fig. 3).

6 Predicting the Hodgkin-Huxley model

We start with a single-compartment Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz model neuron containing voltage-gated
Na+ and leak conductances (Figure 1). A tonic synaptic input to the model evokes repetitive ﬁring
of action potentials. We seek those parameters that minimize the ionic load for an action potential of
constant norm—in other words  spikes whose height relative to the average voltage is fairly constant 
subject to a trade-off with the spike width. The ionic load is directly proportional to the work W
performed by the ion ﬂux. All parameters governing the ion channels’ voltage dependence and
kinetics  including their time constants  mid-points  slopes  and peak values  are subject to change.
The simplest model capable of generating an action potential must have two dynamical variables and
two time scales: one for the upstroke and another for the downstroke. If both Na+ and K+ currents

During optimization  the spikes were constrained to have constant norm (cid:107)V (t) − (cid:104)V (cid:105)(cid:107)16 = 92 mV 
which controls the height of the spike. Insets in the left column display the voltage-dependence of
the optimized time constants for sodium inactivation and potassium activation; sodium activation is
modeled as occurring instantaneously. (a) Model with voltage-dependent inactivation of Na+; time
constants for the ﬁrst order permeability kinetics are voltage-independent (inset). Inactivation turns
off the Na+ current on the downstroke  but not completely: as the K+ current activates to repolarize
the membrane  the inward Na+ current reactivates and counteracts the K+ current; the peak of the
resurgent Na+ current is marked by a triangle. (b) Model with voltage-dependent time constants
for the ﬁrst order kinetics of activation and inactivation. The voltage dependence minimizes the
resurgence of the Na+ current. (c) Power-law gating model with an inwardly rectifying potassium
current replacing the leak current. The power law dependence introduces an effective delay in the
onset of the K+ current  which further minimizes the overlap of Na+ and K+ currents in time.

are persistent  current ﬂows in opposite directions at the same time  so that  even at the optimum  the
ionic load is 1200 nC/cm2. On the other hand  no voltage-gated K+ channels are even required for
a spike  as long as Na+ channels activate on a fast time scale and inactivate on a slower time scale
and the leak is powerful enough to repolarize the neuron. Even so  the load is still 520 nC/cm2.
While spikes require dynamics on two time scales  suppressing the overlap between inward and
outward currents calls for a third time scale. The resulting dynamics are higher-dimensional and
reduce the load to to 239 nC/cm2.
Making the activation and inactivation time constants voltage-dependent permits ion channels to
latch to an open or closed state during the rising and falling phase of the spike  reducing the ionic
load to 189 nC/cm2 (Fig. 2) . The minimal Na+ and K+ currents are separated in time  yet dynamics
that are linear in the activation variables cannot enforce a true delay between the offset of the Na+
current and the onset of the K+ current. If current ﬂow depends on multiple gates that need to be
activated simultaneously  optimization can use the nonlinearity of multiplication to introduce a delay
in the rise of the K+ current that abolishes the overlap  and the ionic load drops to 156 nC/cm2.
Any number of kinetic schemes for the nonlinear permeabilities Pα can give rise to the same spike
waveform V (t)  including the simplest two-dimensional one. Yet only the full Hodgkin-Huxley
(HH) model  with its voltage-dependent kinetics that prevent the premature resurgence of inward
current and cooperative gating that delays the onset of the outward current  minimizes the energetic
cost. More complex models  in which voltage-dependent ion channels make transitions between
multiple closed  inactivated  and open states  instantiate the energy-conserving features of the HH
system at the molecular level. Furthermore  features that are eliminated during optimization  such as
a voltage-dependent inactivation of the outward potassium current  are also not part of the delayed
rectiﬁer potassium current in the Hodgkin-Huxley framework.
