Abstract

There is no generally accepted way to deﬁne wavelets on permutations. We ad-
dress this issue by introducing the notion of coset based multiresolution analysis
(CMRA) on the symmetric group  ﬁnd the corresponding wavelet functions  and
describe a fast wavelet transform for sparse signals. We discuss potential applica-
tions in ranking  sparse approximation  and multi-object tracking.

Introduction

A variety of problems in machine learning  from ranking to multi-object tracking  involve inference
over permutations. Invariably  the bottleneck in such problems is that the number of permutations
grows with n!  ruling out the possibility of representing generic functions or distributions over per-
mutations explicitly  as soon as n exceeds about ten or twelve.
Recently  a number of authors have advocated approximations based on a type of generalized Fourier
transform [1][2][3][4][5][6]. On the group Sn of permutations of n objects  this takes the form

f(σ) ρλ(σ) 

(1)

bf(λ) = X

σ∈Sn

where λ plays the role of frequency  while the ρλ matrix valued functions  called irreducible repre-
sentations  are similar to the e−i2πkx/N factors in ordinary Fourier analysis. It is possible to show

that  just as in classical Fourier analysis  the bf(λ) Fourier matrices correspond to components of f at

different levels of smoothness with respect to the underlying permutation topology [2][7]. Ordering
the λ’s from smooth to rough as λ1 2 λ2 2 . . .  one is thus lead to “band-limited” approximations
of f via the nested sequence of spaces

Vµ = { f ∈ RSn | bf(λ) = 0 for all λ (cid:31) µ } .

While this framework is attractive mathematically  it suffers from the same disease as classical
Fourier approximations  namely its inability to handle discontinuities with grace. In applications
such as multi-object tracking this is a particularly serious issue  because each observation of the
form “object i is at track j” introduces a new discontinuity into the assignment distribution  and the
resulting Gibbs phenonomenon makes it difﬁcult to ensure even that f(σ) remains positive.
The time-honored solution is to use wavelets. However  in the absence of a natural dilation operator 
deﬁning wavelets on a discrete space is not trivial. Recently  Gavish et al. deﬁned an analog of Haar
wavelets on trees [8]  while Coifman and Maggioni [9] and Hammond et al. [10] managed to deﬁne
wavelets on general graphs. In this paper we attempt to do the same on the much more structured
domain of permutations by introducing an altogether new notion of multiresolution analysis  which
we call coset-based multiresolution (CMRA).

2 Multiresolution analysis and the multiscale structure of Sn

The notion of multiresolution analysis on the real line was ﬁrst formalized by Mallat [11]: a nested
sequence of function spaces

. . . ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ . . .

is said to constitute a multiresolution analysis (MRA) for L2(R) if it satisﬁes the following axioms:

MRA1. T
MRA2. S

k Vk = {0} 
k Vk = L2(R) 

MRA3. for any f ∈ Vk and any m ∈ Z  the function f0(x) = f(x − m 2−k) is also in Vk 
MRA4. for any f ∈ Vk  the function f0(x) = f(2x)  is in Vk+1.
Setting Vk+1 = Vk⊕Wk and starting with  say  V‘  the process of moving up the chain of spaces can
be thought of as splitting V‘ into a smoother part V‘−1 (called the scaling space) and a rougher part
W‘−1 (called the wavelet space)  and then repeating this process recursively for V‘−1  V‘−2  and so
on (Figure 1).
To get an actual wavelet transform  one needs to deﬁne appropriate bases for the {Vi} and {Wi}
In the simplest case  a single function φ  called the scaling function  is sufﬁcient to
spaces.
generate an orthonormal basis for V0  and a single function ψ  called the mother wavelet gen-
In this case  deﬁning φk m(x) = 2k/2 φ(2k x − m)  and
erates an orthonormal basis for W0.
ψk m(x) = 2k/2 ψ(2k x− m)  we ﬁnd that {φk m}m∈Z and {ψk m}m∈Z will be orthonormal bases
for Vk and Wk  respectively. Moreover  {ψk m}k m∈Z is an orthonormal basis for the whole of
L2(R). By the wavelet transform of f we mean its expansion in this basis.
The difﬁculty in deﬁning multiresolution analysis on discrete spaces is that there is no natural analog
of dilation  as required by Mallat’s fourth axiom. However  in the speciﬁc case of the symmetric
group  we do at least have a natural multiscale structure on our domain. Our goal in this paper is to
ﬁnd an analog of Mallat’s axioms that can take advantage of this structure.

2.1 Two decompositions of RSn
A permutation of n objects is a bijective mapping {1  2  . . .   n} → {1  2  . . .   n}. With respect to the
natural notion of multiplication (σ2σ1)(i) = σ2(σ1(i))  the n! different permutations of {1  . . .   n}
form a group  called the symmetric group of degree n  which we denote Sn.
Our MRA on Sn is born of the tension between two different ways of carving up RSn into orthogonal
sums of subspaces: one corresponding to subdivision in “time”  the other in “frequency”. The ﬁrst of
these is easier to describe  since it is based on recursively partitioning Sn according to the hierarchy
of sets

Si1 = { σ ∈ Sn | σ(n) = i1 }
Si1 i2 = { σ ∈ Sn | σ(n) = i1  σ(n− 1) = i2 }

i1 ∈ {1  . . .   n}

i1 6= i2 

i1  i2 ∈ {1  . . .   n}  

and so on  down to sets of the form Si1...in−1  which only have a single element. Intuitively  this tree
of nested sets captures the way in which we zoom in on a particular permutation σ by ﬁrst ﬁxing
σ(n)  then σ(n−1)  etc. (see Figure 2 in Appendix B in the Supplement). From the algebraic point
of view  Si1 ... ik is a so-called (left) Sn−k–coset

µi1 ... ik

Sn−k := { µi1...ik τ | τ ∈ Sn−k }

where µi1...ik is a permutation mapping n 7→ i1  . . .   n− k + 1 7→ ik. This emphasizes that in some
sense each Si1 ... ik is just a “copy” of Sn−k inside Sn. The ﬁrst important system of subspaces of
RSn for our purposes are the window spaces

0 ≤ k ≤ n− 1 

{i1  . . .   ik} ⊆ {1  . . .   n} .

Clearly  for any given k  RSn =L

Si1...ik = { f | supp(f) ⊆ Si1...ik }

i1 ... ik

Si1...ik.

The second system of spaces is related to the behavior of functions under translation. In fact  there
are two distinct ways in which a given f ∈ RSn can be translated by some τ ∈ Sn: left–translation 
f 7→ Tτ f  where (Tτ f)(σ) = f(τ−1σ)  and right–translation f 7→ T R
τ f)(σ) =
f(στ−1). For now we focus on the former.
We say that a space V ⊆ RSn is a left Sn–module if it is invariant to left-translation in the sense
that for any f ∈ V and τ ∈ Sn  Tτ f ∈ V . A fundamental result in representation theory tells us
that if V is reducible in the sense that it has a proper subset V1 that is ﬁxed by left-translation  then
V = V1 ⊕ V2  where V1 and V2 are both (left Sn–)modules. In particular  RSn is a (left Sn–)invariant
space  therefore

RSn = M

To understand the interplay between modules and window spaces  observe that each coset
µi1...ik

Sn−k has an internal notion of left–translation

(4)
which ﬁxes Si1...ik. Therefore  Si1...ik must be decomposable into a sum of irreducible Sn−k–
modules

α∈AMα  where the Mα are now irreducible Sn–modules. Whenever a relationship of this type
holds between two sets of irreducible Sn– resp. Sn−k–modules  we say that the {Mα} modules are
induced by {M i1...ik
The situation is complicated by the fact that decompositions like (3) and (5) are not unique. In par-
ticular  there is no guarantee that the {Mα} induced modules will be amongst the modules featured
in (3). However  there is a unique  so-called adapted system of modules  for which this issue does
not arise. Speciﬁcally  if  as is usually done  we let the indexing set Tm be the set of Standard
Young Tableaux (SYT) of size m (see Appendix A in the supplementary materials for the exact
deﬁnition)  such as

3 Coset based multiresolution analysis on Sn

Our guiding principle in deﬁning an analog of Mallat’s axioms for permutations is that the resulting
multiresolution analysis should reﬂect the multiscale structure of the tree of cosets. At the same time 
we also want the {Vk} spaces to be invariant to translation. Letting P be the projection operator

we propose the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 1 We say that a sequence of spaces V0 ⊆ V1 ⊆ . . . ⊆ Vn−1 = RSn forms a left-invariant
coset based multiresolution analysis (L-CMRA) for Sn if
L1. for any f ∈ Vk and any τ ∈ Sn  we have Tτ f ∈ Vk 
L2. if f ∈ Vk  then Pi1...ik+1f ∈ Vk+1  for any i1  . . .   ik+1  and
L3. if g ∈ Vk+1  then for any i1  . . .   ik+1 there is an f ∈ Vk such that Pi1...ik+1f = g.
Given any left-translation invariant space Vk  the unique Vk+1 that satisﬁes axioms L1–L3 is

i1...ik+1Pi1...ik+1Vk. Applying this formula recursively  we ﬁnd that

Vk+1 :=L

Pi1...ik V0 

(8)

Vk = M

i1...ik

so V0 determines the entire sequence of spaces V0  V1  . . .   Vn−1.
MRAs  however  this relationship is not bidirectional: Vk does not determine V0  . . .   Vk−1.
To gain a better understanding of L-CMRA  we exploit that (by axiom L1) each Vk is Sn–invariant 
and is therefore a sum of irreducible Sn–modules. By the following proposition  if V0 is a sum of
adapted modules  then V1  . . .   Vn−1 are easy to describe.

Proposition 1 If {Mt}t∈Tn are the adapted left Sn–modules of RSn  and V0 =L

Example 1 The simplest case of L-CMRA is when ν0 = { 1 2 · · · n }.
In this case  setting
m = n− k  we ﬁnd that ν0 ↓m= { 1 2 · · · m}  and νk = ν0 ↓m↑n is the set of all Young tableaux
whose ﬁrst row starts with the numbers 1  2  . . .   m.
It so happens that M i1...ik

When V0 cannot be written as a direct sum of adapted modules  the analysis becomes signiﬁcantly
more complicated. Due to space limitations  we leave the discussion of this case to the Appendix.

3.1 Bi-invariant multiresolution analysis

The left-invariant multiresolution of Deﬁnition 1 is appropriate for problems like ranking  where we
have a natural permutation invariance with respect to relabeling the objects to be ranked  but not the
ranks themselves. In contrast  in problems like multi-object tracking  we want our V0 ⊂ . . . ⊂ Vn−1
hierarchy to be invariant on both the left and the right. This leads to the following deﬁnition.

τ f ∈ Vk

Deﬁnition 2 We say that a sequence of spaces V0 ⊆ V1 ⊆ . . . ⊆ Vn−1 = RSn forms a bi-invariant
coset based multiresolution analysis (Bi-CMRA) for Sn if
Bi1. for any f ∈ Vk and any τ ∈ Sn  we have Tτ f ∈ Vk and T R
Bi2. if f ∈ Vk−1  then Pi1...ik f ∈ Vk  for any i1  . . .   ik; and
Bi3. Vk is the smallest subspace of RSn satisfying Bi1 and Bi2.
Note that the third axiom had to be modiﬁed somewhat compared to Deﬁnition 1  but essentially it
serves the same purpose as L3.
A subspace U that is invariant to both left- and right-translation (i.e.  for any f ∈ U and any σ  τ ∈ Sn
both Tσf ∈ U and T R
τ f ∈ U) is called a two-sided module. The main reason that Bi-CMRA is
easier to describe than L-CMRA is that the irreducible two-sided modules in RSn  called isotypic
subspaces  are unique. In particular  the isotypics turn out to be

Uλ = M

λ ∈ Λn 

t∈Tn : λ(t)=λ

where λ(t) is the vector (λ1  . . .   λp) in which λi is the number of boxes in row i of t. For t to be a
i=1 λi = n. We use Λn to denote the set

valid SYT  we must have λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ . . . ≥ λp ≥ 1  andPp
space must be of the form Vk =L
these operators are extended to sets of partitions by µ↓m:=S

of all such p–tuples  called integer partitions of n.
Bi-CMRA is a much more constrained framework than L-CMRA because (by axiom Bi1) each Vk
λ∈νk Uλ. It should come as no surprise that the way that ν0
determines ν1  . . .   νn−1 is related to restriction and extension relationships between partitions. We
i≤ λi for all i (assuming λ is padded with zeros to make it the same length as λ) 
write λ0≤ λ if λ0
and for m ≤ n  we deﬁne λ↓m:= { λ0 ∈ Λm | λ0 ≤ λ }  and λ0↑n:= { λ ∈ Λn | λ ≥ λ0 }. Again 
λ∈νλ↑n. (See

Proposition 2 Given a set of partitions ν0 ⊆ Λn  the corresponding Bi-CMRA comprises the spaces

νk = ν0↓n−k↑n .
Moreover  any system of spaces satisfying Deﬁnition 2 is of this form for some ν0 ⊆ Λn.

4 Wavelets

As mentioned in Section 2  to go from multiresolution analysis to orthogonal wavelets  one needs
to deﬁne appropriate bases for the spaces V0  W0  W1  . . . Wn−2. This can be done via the close
connection between irreducible modules and the {ρλ} irreducible representations (irreps)  that we
encountered in the context of the Fourier transform (1). As explained in Appendix A  each integer
partition λ ∈ Λn has a corresponding irrep ρλ : Sn → Rdλ×dλ; the rows and columns of the ρλ(σ)
matrices are labeled by the set Tλ of standard Young tableaux of shape λ; and if the ρλ are deﬁned
according to Young’s Orthogonal Representation (YOR)  then for any t ∈ Tn and t0 ∈ Tλ(t)  the
functions ϕt0(σ) = [ρλ(t)(σ)]t0 t form a basis for the adapted module Mt. Thus  the orthonormal
system of functions

(11)
(12)
seems to be a natural choice of scaling resp. wavelet functions for the L-CMRA of Proposition 1.
Similarly  we can take

as a basis for the Bi-CMRA of Proposition 2. Comparing with (1)  we ﬁnd that if we use these bases
to compute the wavelet transform of a function  then the wavelet coefﬁcients will just be rescaled
versions of speciﬁc columns of the Fourier transform. From the computational point of view  this
is encouraging  because there are well-known and practical fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) available
for Sn [12][13]. On the other hand  it is also somewhat of a letdown  since it suggests that all that
we have gained so far is a way to reinterpret parts of the Fourier transform as wavelet coefﬁcients.
An even more serious concern is that the ψk
t t0 functions are not at all localized in the spatial do-
main  largely contradicting the very idea of wavelets. A solution to this dilemma emerges when we
consider that since

νk+1\ νk = (ν0↓n−k−1↑n) \ (ν0↓n−k↑n) =(cid:0)(ν0↓n−k−1↑n−k) \ (ν0↓n−k)(cid:1)↑n 

each of the Wk wavelet spaces of Proposition 1 can be rewritten as

and similarly  the wavelet spaces of Proposition 2 can be rewritten as

ωk = (ν0↓n−k−1↑n−k) \ (ν0↓n−k) 

ωk = (ν0↓n−k−1↑n−k) \ (ν0↓n−k)

4.1 Overcomplete wavelet bases

While the wavelet spaces W0  . . .   Wk−1 of Bi-CMRA are left- and right-invariant  the wavelets
(17) still carry the mark of the coset tree  which is not a right-invariant object  since it branches in
the speciﬁc order n  n− 1  n− 2  . . .. In contexts where wavelets are used as a means of promoting
sparsity  this will bias us towards sparsity patterns that match the particular cosets featured in the
coset tree. The only way to avoid this phenomenon is to span W0  . . .   Wk−1 with the overcomplete

ing in various applications.

5 Fast wavelet transforms

return(Scalingν(v(f)))

In the absence of fast wavelet transforms  multiresolution analysis would only be of theoretical
interest. Fortunately  our wavelet transforms naturally lend themselves to efﬁcient recursive compu-
tation along branches of the coset tree. This is especially attractive when dealing with functions that
are sparse  since subtrees that only have zeros at their leaves can be eliminated from the transform
altogether.

tion of coefﬁcient vectors {wf (t; i1 . . . ik)}t∈ν↓n−k−1↑n−k. The function Scaling selects the sub-
set of these vectors that are scaling coefﬁcients  whereas Wavelet selects the wavelet coefﬁcients.

A very high level sketch of the resulting algorithm is given in Algorithm 1  while a more detailed
description in terms of actual coefﬁcient matrices is in Appendix E. Bi-CMRA would lead to a
similar algorithm  which we omit for brevity. A key component of these algorithms is the function

Clausen’s FFT [12] uses essentially the same elementary transformations to compute (1). However 
whereas the FFT runs in O(n3n!) operations  by working with the local wavelet functions (17) as
opposed to (12) and (14)  if f is sparse  Algorithm 1 needs only polynomial time.

6 Applications

There is a range of applied problems involving permutations that could beneﬁt from the wavelets
deﬁned in this paper. In this section we mention just two potential applications.

6.1 Spectral analysis of ranking data
Given a distribution p over permutations  the matrix Mk of k’th order marginals is
p(σ) 

[Mk]j1...jk;i1...ik = p( σ(i1) = j1  . . .   σ(ik) = jk ) = X

σ∈S j1...jk
i1...ik

where S j1...jk
Clearly  these matrices satisfy a number of linear equations  and therefore are redundant. However 
it can be shown that for for some appropriate basis transformation matrix Tk 

is the two-sided coset µj1...jk

| τ ∈ Sn−k

Sn−k µ−1

i1...ik

i1...ik

i1...ik

λ∈Tn : λ1≥n−k

i.e.  the Fourier matrices {bp(λ)}λ : λi=n−k capture exactly the “pure k’th order effects” in the dis-
tribution p. In the spectral analysis of rankings  as advocated  e.g.  in [7]  there is a lot of emphasis
on projecting data to this space  Margk  but using an FFT this takes around O(n2n!) time. On the
other hand  Margk is exactly the wavelet space Wk−1 of the Bi-CMRA generated by ν0 = {(n)} of
Example 2. Therefore  when p is q–sparse  noting that d(n−1 1) = n−1  by using the methods of the
previous section  we can ﬁnd its projection to each of these spaces in just O(n4q) time.

6.2 Multi-object tracking

the ﬁrst few Fourier coefﬁcients

In multi-object tracking  as mentioned in the Introduction 

{bp(λ)}λ∈ξ (w.r.t. the majorizing order on permutations) provide an optimal approximation to the

assignment distribution p between targets and tracks in the face of a random noise process [2][1].
However  observing target i at track j will zero out p everywhere outside the coset µjSn−kµ−1
 
which is difﬁcult for the Fourier approach to handle. In fact  by analogy with (7)  denoting the oper-
ator that projects to the space of functions supported on this coset by Pi
j  the new distribution will
jp. Thus  if we set ν0 = ξ  after any single observation  our distribution will lie in V1 of the
just be Pi
corresponding Bi-CMRA.
Unfortunately  after a second observation  p will fall in V2  etc.  leading to a combinatorial explo-
sion in the size of the space needed to represent p. However  while each observation makes p less
smooth  it also makes it more concentrated  suggesting that this problem is ideally suited to a sparse
representation in terms of the overcomplete basis functions of Section 4.1. The important departure
from the fast wavelet transforms of Section 5 is that now  to ﬁnd the optimally sparse representation
Sn−k µi1...ik  which are no
of p  we must allow branching to two-sided cosets of the form µj1...jk
longer mutually disjoint.

7 Conclusions
Starting from the self-similar structure of the Sn−k coset tree  we developed a framework for wavelet
analysis on the symmetric group. Our framework resembles Mallat’s multiresolution analysis in its
axiomatic foundations  yet is closer to continuous wavelet transforms in its invariance properties. It
also has strong ties to the “separation of variables” technique of non-commutative FFTs [14]. In a
certain special case we recover the analog of Haar wavelets on the coset tree  In general  wavelets
can circumvent the rigidity of the Fourier approach when dealing with functions that are sparse
and/or have discontinuities  and  in contrast to the O(n2n!) complexity of the best FFTs  for sparse
functions and a reasonable choice of ν0  our fast wavelet transform runs in O(np) time for some
small p. Importantly  wavelets also provide a natural basis for sparse approximations  which have
hithero not been explored much in the context of permutations. Finally  much of our framework is
applicable not just to the symmetric group  but to other ﬁnite groups  as well.
