Abstract

Pedigrees  or family trees  are directed graphs used to identify sites of the genome
that are correlated with the presence or absence of a disease. With the advent
of genotyping and sequencing technologies  there has been an explosion in the
amount of data available  both in the number of individuals and in the number
of sites. Some pedigrees number in the thousands of individuals. Meanwhile 
analysis methods have remained limited to pedigrees of < 100 individuals which
limits analyses to many small independent pedigrees.
Disease models  such those used for the linkage analysis log-odds (LOD) estima-
tor  have similarly been limited. This is because linkage analysis was originally
designed with a different task in mind  that of ordering the sites in the genome 
before there were technologies that could reveal the order. LODs are difﬁcult to
interpret and nontrivial to extend to consider interactions among sites. These de-
velopments and difﬁculties call for the creation of modern methods of pedigree
analysis.
Drawing from recent advances in graphical model inference and transducer the-
ory  we introduce a simple yet powerful formalism for expressing genetic disease
models. We show that these disease models can be turned into accurate and com-
putationally efﬁcient estimators. The technique we use for constructing the vari-
ational approximation has potential applications to inference in other large-scale
graphical models. This method allows inference on larger pedigrees than previ-
ously analyzed in the literature  which improves disease site prediction.

Introduction

Finding genetic correlates of disease is a long-standing important problem with potential contribu-
tions to diagnostics and treatment of disease. The pedigree model for inheritance is one of the best
deﬁned models in biology  and it has been an area of active statistical and biological research for
over a hundred years.
The most commonly used method to analyze genetic correlates of disease is quite old. After Mendel
introduced  in 1866  the basic model for the inheritance of genomic sites [1] Sturtevant was the ﬁrst 
in 1913  to provide a method for ordering the sites of the genome [2]. The method of Sturtevant
became the foundation for linkage analysis with pedigrees [3  4  5  6]. The problem can be thought
of in Sturtevant’s framework as that of ﬁnding the position of a disease site relative to an map of
existing sites. This is the log-odds (LOD) estimator for linkage analysis which is a likelihood ratio
test  described in more detail below.
The genomic data available now is quite different than the type of data available when LOD was ini-
tially developed. Genomic sites are becoming considerably denser in the genome and technologies
allow us to interrogate the genome for the position of sites [7]. Additionally  most current pedigree

1

analysis methods are exponential either in the number of sites or in the number of individuals. This
produces a limit on the size of the pedigrees under consideration to around < 100 individuals. This
is in contrast to the size of pedigrees being collected: for example the work of [8] includes a con-
nected human pedigree containing 13 generations and 1623 individuals  and the work of [9] includes
a connected non-human data set containing thousands of breeding dogs. Apart from the issues of
pedigree size  the LOD value is difﬁcult to interpret  since there are few models for the distribu-
tion of the statistic. These developments and difﬁculties call for the creation of modern methods of
pedigree analysis.
In this work  we propose a new framework for expressing genetic disease models. The key com-
ponent of our models  the Haplotype-Phenotype Transducer (HPT)  draws from recent advances in
graphical model inference and transducer theory [10]  and provides a simple and ﬂexible formal-
ism for building genetic disease models. The output of inference over HPT models is a posterior
distribution over disease sites  which is easier to interpret than LOD scores.
The cost of this modeling ﬂexibility is that the graphical model corresponding to the inference
problem is larger and has more loops that traditional pedigree graphical models. Our solution to
this challenge is based on the observation that the difﬁcult graphical model can be covered by a
collection of tractable forest graphical models. We use a method based on measure factorization [11]
to efﬁciently combine these approximations. Our approach is applicable to other dense graphical
models  and we show that empirically it gives accurate approximations in dense graphical models
containing millions of nodes as well as short and long cycles. Our approximation can be reﬁned by
adding more trees in the forest  with a cost linear in the number of forests used in the cover. We
show that considerable gains in accuracy can be obtained this way. In contrast  methods such as [12]
can suffer from an exponential increase in running time when larger clusters are considered.
Our framework can be specialized to create analogues of classical penetrance disease models [13].
We focus on these special cases here to compare our method with classical ones. Our experiments
show that even for these simpler cases  our approach can achieve signiﬁcant gains in disease site
identiﬁcation accuracy compared to the most commonly used method  Merlin’s implementation of
LOD scores [3  5]. Moreover  our inference method allows us to perform experiments on unprece-
dented pedigree sizes  well beyond the capacity of Merlin and other pedigree analysis tools typically
used in practice.
While graphical models have played an important role in the development of pedigree analysis
methods [14  15]  only recently were variational methods applied to the problem [6]. However
this previous work is based on the same graphical model as classical LOD methods  while ours
signiﬁcantly differs.
Most current work on more advanced disease models have focused on a very different type of data 
population data  for genome wide association studies (GWAS) [16]. Similarly  state of the art work
on the related task of imputation generally makes similar population assumptions [17].

2 Background

Every individual has two copies of each chromosome  one copy is a collage of the mother’s two
chromosomes while the other is a collage of the father’s two chromosomes. The point at which
the copying of the chromosomes switches from one of the grand-maternal (grand-paternal) chromo-
somes to the other  is called a recombination breakpoint. A site is a particular position in the genome
at which we can obtain measurable values. For the purposes of this paper  an allele is the nucleotide
at a particular site on a particular chromosome. A haplotype is the sequence of alleles that appear
together on the same chromosome.
If we had complete data  we would know the positions of all of the haplotypes  all of the recombina-
tion breakpoints as well as which allele came from which parent. This information is not obtainable
from any known experiment. Instead  we have genotype data which is the set of nucleotides that
appear in an individual’s genome at a particular site. Given that the genotype is a set  it is unordered 
and we do not know which allele came from which parent. All of this and the recombination break-
points must be inferred. An example is given in the Supplement.

A pedigree is a directed acyclic graph with individuals as nodes  where boxes are males and circles
are females  and edges directed downward from parent to child. Every individual must have either
no parents or one parent of each gender. The individuals without parents in the graph are called
founders  and the individuals with parents are non-founders. The pedigree encodes a set of relation-
ships that constrain the allowed inheritance options. These inheritance options deﬁne a probability
distribution which is investigated during pedigree analysis.
Assume a single-site disease model  where a diploid genotype  GD  determines the affection status
(phenotype)  P ∈ {’h’ ’d’}  according to the penetrance probabilities: f2 = P(P = ’d’|GD = 11) 
f1 = P(P = ’d’|GD = 10)  f0 = P(P = ’d’|GD = 00). Here the disease site usually has a disease
allele  1  that confers greater risk of having the disease. For convenience  we denote the penetrance
vector as f = (f2  f1  f0).
Let the pedigree model for n individuals be speciﬁed by a pedigree graph  a disease model f  and
the minor allele frequency  µ  for a single site of interest  k. Let P = (P1  P2  ...  Pn) be a vector
containing the affection status of each individual. Let G = (G1  G2  ...  Gn) be the genotype data for
each individual. Between the disease site and site k  we model the per chromosome  per generation
recombination fraction  ρ  which is the frequency with which recombinations occur between those
two sites. Other sites linked to k can contribute to our estimate via their arrangement in single ﬁrst-
order Markov chain with some sites falling to the left of the disease site and others to the right of the
site of interest. Previous work has shown that given a pedigree model  affection data  and genotype
data  we can estimate ρ.
We deﬁne the likelihood as L(ρ) = P(P = p  G = g|ρ  f  µ) where ρ is the recombination proba-
bility between the disease site and the ﬁrst site  p are the founder allele frequencies  and f are the
penetrance probabilities. To test for linkage between the disease site and the other sites  we maxi-
mize the likelihood to obtain the optimal recombination fraction ρ∗ = argmaxρ L(ρ)/L(1/2). The
test we use is the likelihood ratio test where the null hypothesis is that of no linkage (ρ = 1/2).
Generally referred to as the log-odd score (or LOD score)  the log of this likelihood ratio is
log L(ρ∗) − log L(1/2).

3 Methods

In this section  we describe our model for inferring relationships between phenotypes and genotyped
pedigree datasets. We start by giving a high-level description of the generative process.
The ﬁrst step in this generative process consists in sampling a collection of disease model (DM) vari-
ables  which encode putative relationships between the genetic sites and the observed phenotypes.
There is one disease model variable for each site  s  and to a ﬁrst approximation  Ds can be thought
as taking values zero or one  depending on whether site s is the closest to the primary genetic factor
involved in a disease (a more elaborate example is presented in the Supplement). We use C to denote
the values Ds can take.
The second generative step consists in sampling the chromosomes or haplotypes of a collection of
related individuals. We denote these variables by Hi s x  where  from now on  i is used to index
individuals  s  to index sites  and x ∈ { ‘father’  ‘mother’ }  to index chromosome parental origin.
For SNP data  the set of values H that Hi s x can take generally contains two elements (alleles). A
related variable  the inheritance variables Ri s x  will be sampled jointly with the Hi s x’s to keep
track of the grand-parental origin of each chromosome segment. See Figure 1(a) for a factor graph
representation of the random variables.
Finally  the phenotype Pi  which we assume is taken from a ﬁnite set P  can be sampled for each
individual i in the pedigree. We will deﬁne the distribution of Pi conditionally on the haplotype of
the individual in question  Hi  and on the global disease model D. Note that variables with missing
indices are used to denote random vectors or matrices  for example D = (D1  . . .   DS)  where S
denotes the number of sites.
To summarize this high-level view of the process  and to introduce notations for the distributions
involved:

D ∼ DM(·)
Ri ∼ Recomb(·) for all i

3

Figure 1: (a) The pedigree graphical model for independent sites. There are two plates  one for each individual
and one for each site. The nodes are labeled as follows: M for the marriage node which enforces the Mendelian
inheritance constraints  H for haplotype  L and L(cid:48) for the two alleles  D(1) for the disease site indicator  and
D(2) for the disease allele value. (b) The transducer for DM(·) has three nodes with the start node indicated
by an in-arrow and the end node indicated by an out-arrow. The transducer for Recomb(·) has recombination
parameter θ. This assumes a constant recombination rate across sites  but non-constant rates can be obtained
with a bigger automaton. This transducer for HPT(·) models a recessive disease where the input at each state
is the disease (top) and haplotype alleles (bottom). For these last two transducers any node can be the start or
end node.

The remaining variables (the non-founder individuals’ haplotype variables) are obtained determin-
istically from the values of the founders and the inheritance: Hi s x = Hx(i) s Ri s x   where x(i)
denotes the index of the father (mother) of i if x = ‘father’ (‘mother’). The distribution on the
founder haplotypes is a product of independent Bernoulli distributions  one for each site (the pa-
rameters of these Bernoulli distributions is not restricted to be identically distributed and can be
estimated [3]). Each genotype variable Gs is obtained via a deterministic function of H. Having
generated all the haplotypes and disease variables  we denote the conditional distribution of the
phenotypes as follows:

Pi|(D  Hi) ∼ HPT( · ; D  Hi) 

where HPT stands for a Haplotype-Phenotype Transducer.
We now turn to the description of these distributions  starting with the most important one 
HPT( · ; D  Hi). Formally  this distribution on phenotypes is derived from a weighted automa-
ton  where we view the vectors D and Hi as an input string of length S  the s-th character of which
is the triplet (Ds  Hi s ‘father’  Hi s ‘mother’). We view each of the sampled phenotypes as a length-one
output from a weighted transducer given the input D  Hi. Longer outputs could potentially be used
for more complex phenotypes or diseases.
To illustrate this construction  we show that classical  Mendelian models such as recessive pheno-
types are a special case of this formalism. We also make two simpliﬁcations to facilitate exposition:
ﬁrst  that the disease site is one of the observed sites  and second  that the disease allele is the less
frequent (minor) allele (we show in the Supplement a slightly more complicated transducer that does
not make these assumptions).
Under the two above assumptions  we claim that the state diagrams in Figure 1(b) specify an HPT
transducer for a recessive disease model. Each oval corresponds to a hidden transducer state  and the
annotation inside the oval encodes the tuple of input symbols that the corresponding state consumes.
The emission is depicted on top of the states  with for example ‘d’: 1.0 denotes that a disease
indicator is emitted with weight one. We use ‘h’ for the non-disease (healthy) indicator  and  for
the null emission.
The probability mass function of the HPT is deﬁned as:

(cid:80)
(cid:80)
z∈ZHPT(h c→p) wHPT(z)
z(cid:48)∈ZHPT(h c→(cid:63)) wHPT(z(cid:48))

 

HPT(p; c  h) =

where h ∈ HS  c ∈ CS  p ∈ P  and ZHPT(h  c → p) denotes the set of valid paths in the space
Z of hidden states. The valid paths are sequences of hidden states (depicted by black circles in
Figure 1(b)) starting at the source and ending at the sink  consuming c  h and emitting p along the
way. The star in the denominator of the above equation is used to denote unconstrained emissions.

valid paths is implicitly encoded in the transition diagram of the transducer  and the weight function
wHPT : Z∗ → [0 ∞) can similarly be compactly represented by only storing weights for individual
transitions and multiplying them to get a path weight.
The set of valid paths along with their weights can be thought of as encoding a parametric disease
model. For example  with a recessive disease  shown in Figure 1(b)  we can see that if the transducer
is at the site of the disease (encoded as the current symbol in c being equal to 1) then only an input
homozygous haplotype ‘AA’ will lead to an output disease phenotype ‘d.’ This formalism gives a
considerable amount of ﬂexibility to the modeler  who can go beyond simple Mendelian disease
models by constructing different transducers.
The DM distribution is deﬁned using the same machinery as for the HPT distribution. We show
in Figure 1(b) a weighted automaton that encodes the prior that exactly one site is involved in the
disease  with an unknown  uniformly distributed location in the genome. The probability mass
function of the distribution is given by:

(cid:80)
(cid:80)
z∈ZDM(→c) wDM(z)
z(cid:48)∈ZDM(→(cid:63)) wDM(z(cid:48))

 

DM(c) =

where ZDM(→ c) and ZDM(→ (cid:63)) are direct analogues to the HPT case  with the difference being
that no input is read in the DM case.
The last distribution in our model  Recomb  is standard  but we present it in the new light of the
transducer formalism. Refer to Figure 1(b) for an example based on the standard recombination
model derived from the marginals of a Poisson process. We use the analogous notation:

(cid:80)
(cid:80)
z∈ZRecomb(→r) wRecomb(z)
z(cid:48)∈ZRecomb(→(cid:63)) wRecomb(z(cid:48))

.

Recomb(r) =

4 Computational Aspects

Probabilistic inference in our model is computationally challenging: the variables L  H alone in-
duce a loopy graph [18]  and the addition of the variables D  P introduces more loops as well as
deterministic constraints  which further complicates the situation. After explaining in more detail
the graphical model of interest  we discuss in this section the approximation algorithm that we have
used to infer haplotypes  disease loci  and other disease statistics.
We show in Figure 1(a) the factor graph obtained after turning the observed variables (genotypes
and phenotypes) into potentials (we show a more detailed version in the Supplement). We have also
taken the pointwise product of potentials whenever possible (in the case of the transducer potentials 
how this pointwise product is implemented is discussed in [10]). Note that our graphical model
has more cycles than standard pedigree graphical models [19]; even if we assumed the sites to be
independent and the pedigree to be acyclic  our graphical model would still be cyclic.
Our inference method is based on the following observation: if we kept only one subtype of factors
in the Supplement  say only those connected to the recombination variables R  then inference could
be done easily. More precisely  inference would reduce to a collection of small  standard HMMs
inference problems  which can be done using existing software.
Similarly  by covering the pedigree graph with a collection of subtrees  and removed the factors
for disease and recombination  we can get a collection of acyclic pedigrees  one for each site  and
hence a tractable problem (the sum-product algorithm in this case is called the Elston-Stewart algo-
rithm [14] in the pedigree literature).
We are therefore in a situation where we have several restricted views on our graphical model yield-
ing efﬁciently solved subproblems. How to combine the solutions of these tractable subproblems is
the question we address in the remainder of this section.
The most common way this is approached  in pedigrees [20] and elsewhere [21]  is via block Gibbs
sampling. However  block Gibbs sampling does not apply readily to our model. The main difﬁculty
arises when attempting to resample D: because of the deterministic constraints that arise even in

5

the simplest disease model  it is necessary to sample D in a block also containing a large subset of
R and H. However this cannot be done efﬁciently since D is connected to all individuals in the
pedigree. More formally  the difﬁculty is that some of the components we wish to resample are
b-acyclic (barely acyclic) [22]. Another method  closer to ours  is the EP algorithm of [23]  which
however considers a single tree approximant  while we can accommodate several at once. As we
show in the empirical section  it is advantageous to do so in pedigrees.
An important feature that we will exploit in the development of method is the forest cover property
of the tractable subproblems: we view each tractable subproblem as a subgraph of the initial factor
graph  and ask that the union of these subgraph coincides with the original factor graph.
Previous variational approaches have been proposed to exploit such forest covers. The most well-
known example  the structured mean ﬁeld approximation  is unfortunately non-trivial to optimize in
the b-acyclic case [22]. Tree reweighted belief propagation [24] has an objective function derived
from a forest distribution  however the corresponding algorithms are based on local message passing
rather than large subproblems.
We propose an alternative based on the measure factorization framework [11]. As we will see 
this yields an easy to implement variation approximation that can efﬁciently exploit arbitrary forest
cover approximations. Since the measure factorization interpretation of our approach is not speciﬁc
to pedigrees  we present it in the context of a generic factor graph over a discrete space  viewed as
an exponential family with sufﬁcient statistics φ  log normalization A  and parameters θ:

P(X = x) = exp{(cid:104)φ(x)  θ(cid:105) − A(θ)} .

us also denote the number of nodes connected to factor ϕ by nϕ. This vector y has N = (cid:80)

(1)
To index the factors  we use ϕ ∈ F = {1  ...  F}  and v to index the V variables in the factor graph.
We start by reparameterizing the exponential family in terms of a larger vector y of variables. Let
ϕ nϕ
components  each corresponding to a pair containing a factor and a node index attached to it  and
denoted by yϕ v. The reparameterization is given by:

P(Y = y) = exp(cid:8)(cid:104)φ(y)  θ(cid:105) − A

(cid:48)

(θ)(cid:9) (cid:89)

(cid:89)

1[yϕ v = yϕ(cid:48) v].

(2)

ϕ ϕ(cid:48)∈F

v

Because of the indicator variables in the right hand side of Equation 2  the set of y’s with P(Y =
y) > 0 is in bijection with the set of x’s with P(X = x) > 0. It is therefore well-deﬁned to overload
the variable φ in the same equation. Similarly  we have that A(cid:48) = A. This reparameterization is
inspired by the auxiliary variables used to construct the sampler of Swendsen-Wang [25].
Next  suppose that the sets F1  . . .  FK form a forest cover of the factor graph  Fk ⊂ F. Then  for
k ∈ {1  . . .   K}  we build as follows the super-partitions required for the measure factorization to
apply (as deﬁned in [11]):

(cid:88)

exp{(cid:104)φ(y)  θ(cid:105)} (cid:89)

(cid:89)

ϕ ϕ(cid:48)∈Fk

v

Ak(θ) =

y

1[yϕ v = yϕ(cid:48) v].

(3)

Note that computing each Ak is tractable: it corresponds to computing the normalization of one of
the forest covering the graphical model. Similarly  gradients of Ak can be computed as the moments
of a tree shaped graphical model. Also  the product over k of the base measures in Equation 3 is equal
to the base measure of Equation 2. We have therefore constructed a valid measure factorization.
With this construction in hand  it is then easy to apply the measure factorization framework to get a
principled way for the different subproblem views to exchange messages [11].

5 Experiments

We did two sets of experiments. Haplotype reconstructions were used to assess the quality of the
variational approximation. Disease predictions were used to validate the HPT disease model.

Simulations. Pedigree graphs were simulated using a Wright-Fisher model [26]. In this model
there is a ﬁxed number of male individuals  n  and female individuals  n  per generation  making
the population size 2n. The pedigree is built starting from the oldest generation. Each successively
more recent generation is built by having each individual in that generation choose uniformly at
random one female parent and one male parent. Notice that this process allows inbreeding.

Figure 2: The pedigree was generated with the following parameters  number of generations 20 and n = 15
which resulted in a pedigree with 424 individuals  197 marriage nodes  47 founders. We simulated 1000
markers. The metric used for all panels is the haplotype reconstruction metric. Panel (a) shows the effect of
removing factors from the forest cover of the pedigree where the lines are labeled with the number of factors
that each experiment contains. Panel (b) shows the effect of removing the recombination factor (false) or using
it (true). Together  panels (a-b) show that having more factors helps inference. Panel (c) shows the effect of an
incorrect recombination parameter on inference. The correct parameter  with which the data was generated  is
line 0.0005. Two incorrect parameters are shown 0.00005 and 0.005. This panel shows that the recombination
parameter can be off by an order of magnitude and the haplotype reconstruction is robust.

Genotype data were simulated in the simulated pedigree graph. The founder haplotypes were drawn
from an empirical distribution (see Supplement for details). The recombination parameters used
for inheritance are given in the Supplement. We then simulated the inheritance and recombination
process to obtain the haplotypes of the descendants using the external program [27]. We used two
distributions for the founder haplotypes  corresponding to two data sets.
Individuals with missing data were sampled  where each individual either has all their genetic data
missing or not. A random 50% of the non-founder individuals have missing data. An independent
50% of individuals have missing phenotypes for the disease prediction comparison.

Haplotype Reconstruction. For the haplotype reconstruction  the inference being scored is  for
each individual  the maximum a posteriori haplotype predicted by the marginal haplotype distri-
bution. These haplotypes are not necessarily Mendelian consistent  meaning that it is possible for
a child to have an allele on the maternal haplotype that could not possibly be inherited from the
mother according to the mother’s marginal distribution. However  transforming the posterior dis-
tribution over haplotypes into a set of globally consistent haplotypes is somewhat orthogonal to
the methods in this paper  and there exist methods for this task [28]. The goal of this comparison
is threefold: 1) to see if adding more factors improves inference  2) to see if more iterations of
the measure factorization algorithm help  and 3) to see if there is robustness of the results to the
recombination parameters.
Synthetic founder haplotypes were simulated  see Supplement for details. Each experiment was
replicated 10 times where for each replicate the founder haplotypes were sampled with a different
random seed. We computed a metric φ which is a normalized count of the number of sites that differ
between the held-out haplotype and the predicted haplotype. See the Supplement for details.
Figure 2 shows the results for the haplotype reconstruction. Panels (a) and (b) show that adding more
factors helps inference accuracy. Panel (c) shows that inference accuracy is robust to an incorrect
recombination parameter.

Disease Prediction. For disease prediction  the inference being scored is the ranking of the sites
given by our Bayesian method as compared with LOD estimates computed by Merlin [3]. The dis-
ease models we consider are recessive f = (0.95  0.05  0.05) and dominant f = (0.95  0.95  0.05).
The disease site is one of the sites chosen uniformly at random. The goal of this comparison is to
see whether our disease model performs at least as well as the LOD estimator used by Merlin.

Table 1: This table gives the performance of our method and Merlin for recessive and dominant diseases as
measured by the disease prediction metric. The sizes of the simulated pedigrees are given in the ﬁrst three
columns  the disease model in the next three columns  and the performance of our method and that of Merlin in
the ﬁnal four columns. In all instances  our method outperforms Merlin sometimes by an order of magnitude.
Results suggest that the standard deviation of our method is smaller than that of Merlin. Notably  Merlin cannot
even analyze the largest pedigrees  because Merlin does exact inference.

The founder haplotypes were taken from the phased haplotypes of the JPT+CHB HapMap [29]
populations  see Supplement for details. Each experiment was replicated 10 times where for each
replicate the founder haplotypes were sampled with a different random seed. We computed a metric
ψ which is roughly the rank of the disease site in the sorted list of predictions given by each method.
Table 1 compares the performance of our method against that of Merlin. In every case our method
has better accuracy. The results suggest that our method has a lower standard deviation. Within
each delineated row of the table  the mean ψ are not comparable because the pedigrees might be of
different complexities. Between delineated rows of the table  we can compare the effect of pedigree
size  and we observe that larger pedigrees aid in disease site prediction. Indeed  the largest pedigree
of 1276 individuals reaches an accuracy of 6e−4. This pedigree is the largest pedigree that we know
of being analyzed in the literature.

6 Discussion

This paper introduces a new disease model and a new variational inference method which are applied
to ﬁnd a Bayesian solution to the disease-site correlation problem. This is in contrast to traditional
linkage analysis where a likelihood ratio statistic is computed to ﬁnd the position of the disease site
relative to a map of existing sites. Instead  our approach is to use a Haplotype-Phenotype Transducer
to obtain a posterior for the probability of each site to be the disease site. This approach is well-
suited to modern data which is very dense in the genome. Particularly with sequencing data  it is
likely that either the disease site or a nearby site will be observed.
Our method performs well in practice both for genotype prediction and for disease site prediction.
In the presence of missing data  where for some individuals the whole genome is missing  our
method is able to infer the missing genotypes with high accuracy. As compared with LOD linkage
analysis method  our method was better able to predict the disease site when one observed site was
responsible for the disease.
