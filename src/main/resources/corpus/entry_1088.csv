Abstract

Latent variable models are frequently used to identify structure in dichotomous
network data  in part because they give rise to a Bernoulli product likelihood that
is both well understood and consistent with the notion of exchangeable random
graphs. In this article we propose conservative conﬁdence sets that hold with re-
spect to these underlying Bernoulli parameters as a function of any given partition
of network nodes  enabling us to assess estimates of residual network structure 
that is  structure that cannot be explained by known covariates and thus cannot be
easily veriﬁed by manual inspection. We demonstrate the proposed methodology
by analyzing student friendship networks from the National Longitudinal Survey
of Adolescent Health that include race  gender  and school year as covariates. We
employ a stochastic expectation-maximization algorithm to ﬁt a logistic regres-
sion model that includes these explanatory variables as well as a latent stochastic
blockmodel component and additional node-speciﬁc effects. Although maximum-
likelihood estimates do not appear consistent in this context  we are able to evalu-
ate conﬁdence sets as a function of different blockmodel partitions  which enables
us to qualitatively assess the signiﬁcance of estimated residual network structure
relative to a baseline  which models covariates but lacks block structure.

Introduction

1
Network datasets comprising edge measurements Aij ∈ {0  1} of a binary  symmetric  and anti-
reﬂexive relation on a set of n nodes  1 ≤ i < j ≤ n  are fast becoming of paramount interest in the
statistical analysis and data mining literatures [1]. A common aim of many models for such data is
to test for and explain the presence of network structure  primary examples being communities and
blocks of nodes that are equivalent in some formal sense. Algorithmic formulations of this problem
take varied forms and span many literatures  touching on subjects such as statistical physics [2  3] 
theoretical computer science [4]  economics [5]  and social network analysis [6].
One popular modeling assumption for network data is to assume dyadic independence of the edge
measurements when conditioned on a set of latent variables [7  8  9  10]. The number of latent
parameters in such models generally increases with the size of the graph  however  meaning that
computationally intensive ﬁtting algorithms may be required and standard consistency results may
not always hold. As a result  it can often be difﬁcult to assess statistical signiﬁcance or quantify
the uncertainty associated with parameter estimates. This issue is evident in literatures focused

1

on community detection  where common practice is to examine whether algorithmically identiﬁed
communities agree with prior knowledge or intuition [11  12]; this practice is less useful if additional
conﬁrmatory information is unavailable  or if detailed uncertainty quantiﬁcation is desired.
Conﬁdence sets are a standard statistical tool for uncertainty quantiﬁcation  but they are not yet
well developed for network data. In this paper  we propose a family of conﬁdence sets for net-
work structure that apply under the assumption of a Bernoulli product likelihood. The form of
these sets stems from a stochastic blockmodel formulation which reﬂects the notion of latent nodal
classes  and they provide a new tool for the analysis of estimated or algorithmically determined
network structure. We demonstrate usage of the conﬁdence sets by analyzing a sample of 26 ado-
lescent friendship networks from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (available
at http://www.cpc.unc.edu/addhealth)  using a baseline model that only includes explanatory covari-
ates and heterogeneity in the nodal degrees. We employ these conﬁdence sets to validate departures
from this baseline model taking the form of residual community structure. Though the conﬁdence
sets we employ are conservative  we show that they are effective in identifying putative residual
structure in these friendship network data.

2 Model Speciﬁcation and Inference
We represent network data via a sociomatrix A ∈ {0  1}N×N that reﬂects the adjacency structure
of a simple  undirected graph on N nodes. In keeping with the latent variable network analysis
literature  we assume entries {Aij} for i < j to be independent Bernoulli random variables with
associated success probabilities {Pij}i<j  and complete A as a symmetric matrix with zeros along
its main diagonal. The corresponding data log-likelihood is given by

L(A; P ) =

Aij log(Pij) + (1 − Aij) log(1 − Pij) 

(1)

(cid:88)

i<j

where each Pij can itself be modeled as a function of latent as well as explanatory variables.
Given an instantiation of A and a latent variable model for the probabilities {Pij}i<j  it is natural
to seek a quantiﬁcation of the uncertainty associated with estimates of these Bernoulli parameters.
A standard approach in non-network settings is to posit a parametric model and then compute conﬁ-
dence intervals  for example by appealing to standard maximum-likelihood asymptotics. However 
as mentioned earlier  the formulation of most latent variable network models dictates an increas-
ing number of parameters as the number of network nodes grows; this amount of expressive power
appears necessary to capture many salient characteristics of network data. As a result  standard
asymptotic results do not necessarily apply  leaving open questions for inference.

2.1 A Logistic Regression Model for Network Structure

To illustrate the complexities that can arise in this inferential setting  we adopt a latent variable
network model with a standard ﬂavor: a logistic regression model that simultaneously incorporates
aspects of blockmodels  additive effects  and explanatory variables (see [10] for a more general for-
mulation). Speciﬁcally  we incorporate a K-class stochastic blockmodel component parameterized
in terms of a symmetric matrix Θ ∈ RK×K and a membership vector z ∈ {1  . . .   K}N whose val-
ues denote the class of each node  with Pij depending on Θzizj . A vector of additional node-speciﬁc
latent variables α is included to account for heterogeneity in the observed nodal degrees  along with
a vector of regression coefﬁcients β corresponding to explanatory variables x(i  j). Thus we obtain
the log-odds parameterization

where we further enforce the identiﬁability constraint that(cid:80)

2.2 Likelihood-Based Inference

Exact maximization of the log-likelihood L(A; z  Θ  α  β  x) is computationally demanding even for
moderately large K and N  owing to the total number of nodal partitions induced by z. Algorithm 1
details a stochastic expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to explore the likelihood space.

1. Set t = 0 and initialize (z(0)  Θ(0)  α(0)  β(0)).
2. For iteration t  do:

E-step Sample z(t) ∝ exp{L(z | A; Θ(t)  α(t)  β(t)  x)}
M-step Set (Θ(t)  α(t)  β(t)) = argmaxΘ α β L(Θ  α  β | z(t); A  x)

(e.g.  via Gibbs sampling)

(convex optimization)

3. Set t ← t + 1 and return to Step 2.

When α and β are ﬁxed to zero  model (2) reduces to a re-parameterization of the standard stochas-
tic blockmodel. Consistency results for this model have been developed for a range of condi-
tions [7  13  14  15  16]. However  it is not clear how uncertainty in z and Θ should be quantiﬁed
or even concisely expressed: in this vein  previous efforts to assess the robustness of ﬁtted struc-
ture include [17]  in which community partitions are analyzed under perturbations of the network 
and [18]  in which the behavior of local minima resulting from simulated annealing is examined; a
likelihood-based test is proposed in [19] to compare sets of community divisions.
Without the blockmodel components z and Θ  the model of Eq. (2) reduces to a generalized lin-
ear model whose likelihood can be maximized by standard methods. If α is further constrained
to equal 0  the model is ﬁnite dimensional and standard asymptotic results for inference can be
applied. Otherwise  the increasing dimensionality of α brings consistency into question  and in
fact certain negative results are known for a related model  known as the p1 exponential random
graph model [20]. Speciﬁcally  [21] reports that the maximum likelihood estimator for the p1 model
exhibits bias with magnitude equal to its variance. Although estimation error does converge asymp-
totically to zero for the p1 model  it is not known how to generate general conﬁdence intervals or
hypothesis tests; [22] prescribes reporting standard errors only as summary statistics  with no asso-
ciation to p-values. The predictions of [21] were replicated (reported below) when ﬁtting simulated
data drawn from the model of Eq. (2) with parameters matched to observed characteristics of the
Adolescent Health friendship networks.
Model selection techniques  such as out-of-sample prediction  are sometimes used to validate sta-
tistical network models. For example  [23] uses out-of-sample prediction to compare the stochastic
blockmodel to other network models. We note that model selection techniques and the conﬁdence
estimates presented here are complementary. To choose the best model for the data  a model selec-
tion method should be used; however  if the parameter will be interpreted to draw conclusions about
the data  a conﬁdence estimate may be desired as well.

2.3 Conﬁdence Sets for Network Structure

Instead of quantifying the uncertainty associated with estimates of the model parameters
(z  Θ  α  β)  we directly ﬁnd conﬁdence sets for the Bernoulli likelihood parameters {Pij}i<j. To
this end  for any ﬁxed K and class assignment z  deﬁne symmetric matrices ¯Φ  ˆΦ in [0  1]K×K
element-wise for 1 ≤ a ≤ b as

¯Φ(z)

ab =

1
nab

Pij 1{zi = a  zj = b} 

ˆΦ(z)

ab =

1
nab

Aij 1{zi = a  zj = b} 

with nab denoting the maximum number of possible edges between classes a and b (i.e.  the cor-
responding number of Bernoulli trials). Thus ¯Φ(z)
ab is the expected proportion of edges between (or
within  if a = b) classes a and b  under class assignment z  and ˆΦ(z)
ab is its corresponding sample
proportion estimator.
Intuitively  ¯Φ(z) measures assortativity by z; whenever the sociomatrix A is unstructured  elements
of ¯Φ(z) should be nearly uniform for any choice of partition z. When strong community structure is
present in A  however  these elements should instead be well separated for corresponding values of
z. Thus  it is of interest to examine a conﬁdence set that relates ˆΦ(z)
ab to its expected value ¯Φ(z) for
a range of partitions z. To this end  we may deﬁne such a set by considering a weighted sum of the

Because Eq. (3) holds uniformly over all class assignments  we may choose to apply it directly to the
value of z obtained from Algorithm 1—and because it does not assume any particular form of latent
structure  we are able to avoid the difﬁculties associated with determining conﬁdence sets directly
for the parameters of latent variable models such as Eq. (2). However  it is important to note that
this generality comes at a price: In simulation studies undertaken in [14] as well as those detailed
below  the bound of Eq. (3) is observed to be loose by a multiplicative factor ranging from 3 to 7 on
average.

2.4 Estimator Consistency and Conﬁdence Sets

Recalling our above discussion of estimator consistency for the related p1 model  we undertook
a small simulation study to investigate the consistency of maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation
in a “baseline” version of model (2) with K = 1 and the corresponding (scalar) value of Θ
set equal to zero. We compared estimates for the cases α = 0 versus α unconstrained for 500
graphs generated randomly from a model of the form speciﬁed in Eq. (2) based on school 8 of
the Add-Health data set. The number of nodes N = 204 and covariates x(i  j) matched that of
School 8 in the Adolescent Health friendship network dataset  and the regression coefﬁcient vector
β = (−2.6  0.025  0.9 −1.6)(cid:48)  set to match the ML estimate of β for School 8  ﬁtted via logistic re-
gression with Θ = 0  α = 0. The covariates x(i  j) comprised of an intercept term  an indicator for
whether students i and j shared the same gender  an indicator for shared race  and their difference
in school grade.
The inclusion of α in the model of Eq. (2) appears to give rise to a loss of estimator consistency  as
shown in Table 1 where the empirical bias of each component of β is reported. This suggests  as
we alluded to above  that inferential conclusions based on parameter estimates from latent variable
models should be interpreted with caution.
To explore the tightness of the conﬁdence sets given by the bound in Eq. (3)  we ﬁtted the full
model speciﬁed in Eq. (2) with K in the range 2–6 to 50 draws from a restricted version of the
model corresponding to each of the 26 schools in our dataset.
In the same manner described
above  each simulated graph shared the same size and covariates as its corresponding school in
the dataset  with β ﬁxed to its ML-ﬁtted value with Θ = 0  α = 0. The empirical divergence term
ab ) under the approximate ML partition determined via Algorithm 1 was then
tabulated for each of these 1300 ﬁts  and compared to its 95% conﬁdence upper bound given by
Eq. (3). The empirical divergences are reported in the histogram of Fig. 1 as a fraction of the up-
per bound. It may be seen from Fig. 1 that the largest divergence observed was less than 41% of
its corresponding bound  with 95% of all divergences less than 22% of their corresponding bound.

This analysis provides an indication of how inﬂated the conﬁdence set sizes are expected to be in
practice; while conservative in nature  they seem usable for practical situations.

3 Analysis of Adolescent Health Networks

The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) is a study of adolescents in the
United States. To date  four waves of surveys have been collected over the course of ﬁfteen years.
Many statistical studies have been performed using the data to explore a variety of social and health
issues1. For example  [24  25] discusses effects of racial diversity on community formation across
schools. Here we examine the schools individually to ﬁnd residual block structure not explained by
gender  race  or grade. Since we will be unable to verify such blocks by checking against explanatory
variables  we rely on the conﬁdence sets developed above to assess signiﬁcance of the discovered
block structure.
Our approach is as follows. As discussed in Section 2.3  Eq. (3) enables us to calculate conﬁdence
sets with respect to Bernoulli parameters {Pij} for any class membership vector z in terms of the
corresponding sample proportion matrices ˆΦ(z). Then  by comparing values of ˆΦ(z) to a baseline
model obtained by ﬁtting K = 1  Θ = 0 (thus removing the stochastic block component from
Eq. (2))  we may evaluate whether or not the observed sample counts are consistent with the structure
predicted by the baseline model. This procedure provides a kind of notional p-value to qualitatively
assess signiﬁcance of the residual structure induced by any choice of z.

3.1 Model Checking

We ﬁrst ﬁt model (2) with Θ = 0 and α = 0  since it reduces to a logistic regression with explanatory
variables x(i  j)  for which standard asymptotic results apply. The parameter ﬁts were examined and
an analysis of deviance was conducted. The ﬁts were observed to be well behaved in this setting;
estimates of β and their corresponding standard errors indicate a clustering effect by grade that is
stronger than that of either shared gender or race. An analysis of deviance  where each variable was
withheld from the model  resulted in similar conclusions: Average deviances across the 26 schools
were −69  −238  and −3760 for gender  race  and grade respectively  with p-values below 0.05
indicating signiﬁcance in all but 3  7  and 0 of the schools for each of the respective covariates; these
schools had small numbers of students  with a maximum N of 108.
When α was re-introduced into the model of Eq. (2)  its components were observed to correlate
highly with the sequence of observed nodal degrees in the data  as expected. (Recall that consistency
results are not known for this model  so that p-values cannot be associated with deviances or standard
errors; however  in our simulations the maximum-likelihood estimates showed moderate errors  as
discussed in Section 2.4.) For two of the schools  the resulting model was degenerate  whereas for
the remaining schools the α-degree correlation had a range of 0.78–0.94 and a median value of 0.89.

latent block and school year (grade) for School 6. The inferred block structure approximately aligns
with the grade covariate (which was not included in this model).

Estimates of β did not undergo qualitative signiﬁcant changes from their earlier values when the
restriction α = 0 was lifted.
A “pure” stochastic blockmodel (α = 0  β = 0) was ﬁtted to our data over the range K ∈ {2  . . .   6} 
to observe if the resulting block structure replicates that of any of the known covariates. Figure 2
shows counts of students by latent class (under the approximate maximum-likelihood estimate of
z) and grade for School 6; it can be seen that the recovered grouping of students by latent class is
closely aligned with the grade covariate  particularly for grades 7–10.

3.2 Residual Block Structure

We now report on the assessment of residual block structure in the Adolescent Health friendship
network data. Recalling that the conﬁdence sets obtained with Eq. (3) hold uniformly for all par-
titions of equal size  independently of how they are chosen  we therefore may freely modify the
ﬁtting procedure of Algorithm 1 to obtain partitions that exhibit the greatest degree of structure.
Bearing in mind the high observed α-degree correlation as discussed above  we replaced the latent
variable vector α in the model of Eq. (2) with a more parsimonious categorical covariate determined
by grouping the observed network degrees according to the ranges 0–3  4–7  and 8–∞. We also
expanded the covariates by giving each race and grade pairing its own indicator function. These
modiﬁcations would be inappropriate for the baseline model  as dyadic independence conditioned
on the covariates would be lost  and standard errors for β would be larger; however  the changes
were useful for improving the output of Algorithm 1 without invalidating Eq. (3).
Fig. 3 depicts partitions for which the observed ˆΦ(z)  ﬁtted for various K > 1 using the modiﬁed
version of Algorithm 1 detailed above  is “far” from its nominal value under the baseline model ﬁtted
with K = 1  in the sense that the corresponding 95% Bonferroni-corrected conﬁdence set bound is
exceeded. We observe that in each partition  the number of apparently visible communities exceeds
K  and they are comprised of small numbers of students. This effect is due to the intersection of
grade and z-induced clustering.
We take as our deﬁnition of nominal value the quantity ¯Φ(z) computed under the base-
line model  which we denote by Φ(z).

alignment between the corresponding partitions z and the explanatory variables. The alignment

class to total variance2  signifying the residual quality of the partitions  while the relatively large
divergence terms signify that the Bonferroni-corrected conﬁdence set bounds for each school have
been met or exceeded.

Table 2: Block structure assessments corresponding to Fig. 3. Small Jacaard coefﬁcient values (for
gender  race  and grade) and variance ratios approaching 1 for degree indicate a lack of alignment
with covariates and hence the identiﬁcation of residual structure in the corresponding partition.

We note that the usage of covariate information was necessary to detect small student groups; with-
out the incorporation of grade effects  we would require a much larger value of K for Algorithm 1 to
detect the observed network structure (a concern noted by [23] in the absence of covariates)  which
in turn would inﬂate the conﬁdence set  leading to an inability to validate the observed structure
from that predicted by a baseline model.

4 Concluding Remarks

In this article we have developed conﬁdence sets for assessing inferred network structure  by lever-
aging our result derived in [14]. We explored the use of these conﬁdence sets with an application to
the analysis of Adolescent Health survey data comprising friendship networks from 26 schools.
Our methodology can be summarized as follows. In lieu of a parametric model  we assume dyadic
independence with Bernoulli parameters {Pji}. We introduced a baseline model (K = 1) that in-
corporates degree and covariate effects  without block structure. Algorithm 1 was then used to ﬁnd
highly assortative partitions of students which are also far from partitions induced by the explana-
tory covariates in the baseline model. Differences in assortativity were quantiﬁed by an empirical
divergence statistic  which was compared to an upper bound computed from Eq. (3) to check for sig-
niﬁcance and to generate conﬁdence sets for {Pij}. While the upper bound in Eq. (3) is known to be
loose  simulation results in Figure 1 suggest that the slack is moderate  leading to useful conﬁdence
sets in practice.
In our procedure  we cannot quantify the uncertainty associated with the estimated baseline model 
since the parameter estimates lack consistency. As a result  we cannot conduct a formal hypothesis
test for Θ = 0. However  for a baseline model where the MLE is known to be consistent  we con-
jecture that such a hypothesis test should be possible by incorporating the conﬁdence set associated
with the MLE.
Despite concerns regarding estimator consistency in this and other latent variable models  we were
able to show that the notion of conﬁdence sets may instead be used to provide a (conservative)
measure of residual block structure. We note that many open questions remain  and are hopeful
that this analysis may help to shed light on some important current issues facing practitioners and
theorists alike in statistical network analysis.
