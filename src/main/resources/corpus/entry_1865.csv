Abstract

Most real-world networks are too large to be measured or studied directly and
there is substantial interest in estimating global network properties from smaller
sub-samples. One of the most important global properties is the number of ver-
tices/nodes in the network. Estimating the number of vertices in a large network is a
major challenge in computer science  epidemiology  demography  and intelligence
analysis. In this paper we consider a population random graph G = (V  E) from the
stochastic block model (SBM) with K communities/blocks. A sample is obtained
by randomly choosing a subset W ⊆ V and letting G(W ) be the induced subgraph
in G of the vertices in W . In addition to G(W )  we observe the total degree of
each sampled vertex and its block membership. Given this partial information  we
propose an efﬁcient PopULation Size Estimation algorithm  called PULSE  that
accurately estimates the size of the whole population as well as the size of each
community. To support our theoretical analysis  we perform an exhaustive set of
experiments to study the effects of sample size  K  and SBM model parameters
on the accuracy of the estimates. The experimental results also demonstrate that
PULSE signiﬁcantly outperforms a widely-used method called the network scale-up
estimator in a wide variety of scenarios.

Introduction

Many real-world networks cannot be studied directly because they are obscured in some way  are too
large  or are too difﬁcult to measure. There is therefore a great deal of interest in estimating properties
of large networks via sub-samples [15  5]. One of the most important properties of a large network
is the number of vertices it contains. Unfortunately census-like enumeration of all the vertices in a
network is often impossible  so researchers must try to learn about the size of real-world networks
by sampling smaller components. In addition to the size of the total network  there is great interest
in estimating the size of different communities or sub-groups from a sample of a network. Many
real-world networks exhibit community structure  where nodes in the same community have denser
connections than those in different communities [10  18]. In the following examples  we describe
network size estimation problems in which only a small subgraph of a larger network is observed.
Social networks. The social and economic value of an online social network (e.g. Facebook 
Instagram  Twitter) is closely related to the number of users the service has. When a social networking
service does not reveal the true number of users  economists  marketers  shareholders  or other groups
may wish to estimate the number of people who use the service based on a sub-sample [4].
World Wide Web. Pages on the World-Wide Web can be classiﬁed into several categories (e.g.
academic  commercial  media  government  etc.). Pages in the same category tend to have more
connections. Computer scientists have developed crawling methods for obtaining a sub-network of
web pages  along with their hyperlinks to other unknown pages. Using the crawled sub-network and
hyperlinks  they can estimate the number of pages of a certain category [17  16  21  13  19].

Size of the Internet. The number of computers on the Internet (the size of the Internet) is of great
interest to computer scientists. However  it is impractical to access and enumerate all computers
on the Internet and only a small sample of computers and the connection situation among them are
accessible [24].
Counting terrorists. Intelligence agencies often target a small number of suspicious or radicalized
individuals to learn about their communication network. But agencies typically do not know the
number of people in the network. The number of elements in such a covert network might indicate
the size of a terrorist force  and would be of great interest [7].
Epidemiology. Many of the groups at greatest risk for HIV infection (e.g. sex workers  injection
drug users  men who have sex with men) are also difﬁcult to survey using conventional methods.
Since members of these groups cannot be enumerated directly  researchers often trace social links to
reveal a network among known subjects. Public health and epidemiological interventions to mitigate
the spread of HIV rely on knowledge of the number of HIV-positive people in the population [12  11 
22  23  8].
Counting disaster victims. After a disaster  it can be challenging to estimate the number of people
affected. When logistical challenges prevent all victims from being enumerated  a random sample of
individuals may be possible to obtain [2  3].
In this paper  we propose a novel method called PULSE for estimating the number of vertices and the
size of individual communities from a random sub-sample of the network. We model the network
as an undirected simple graph G = (V  E)  and we treat G as a realization from the stochastic
blockmodel (SBM)  a widely-studied extension of the Erd˝os-Rényi random graph model [20] that
accommodates community structures in the network by mapping each vertex into one of K ≥ 1
disjoint types or communities. We construct a sample of the network by choosing a sub-sample of
vertices W ⊆ V uniformly at random without replacement  and forming the induced subgraph G(W )
of W in G. We assume that the block membership and total degree d(v) of each vertex v ∈ W are
observed. We propose a Bayesian estimation algorithm PULSE for N = |V |  the number of vertices in
the network  along with the number of vertices Ni in each block. We ﬁrst prove important regularity
results for the posterior distribution of N. Then we describe the conditions under which relevant
moments of the posterior distribution exist. We evaluate the performance of PULSE in comparison
with the popular “network scale-up” method (NSUM) [12  11  22  23  8  14  9]. We show that while
NSUM is asymptotically unbiased  it suffers from serious ﬁnite-sample bias and large variance. We
show that PULSE has superior performance – in terms of relative error and variance – over NSUM in
a wide variety of model and observation scenarios. All proofs are given in the extended version [6].

2 Problem Formulation

probability pij ∈ [0  1]. Let Ni be the number of type-i vertices in G  with N =(cid:80)K

The stochastic blockmodel (SBM) is a random graph model that generalizes the Erd˝os-Rényi random
graph [20]. Let G = (V  E) ∼ G(N  K  p  t) be a realization from an SBM  where N = |V | is the
total number of vertices  the vertices are divided into K types indexed 1  . . .   K  speciﬁed by the
map t : V → {1  . . .   K}  and a type-i vertex and a type-j vertex are connected independently with
i=1 Ni. The degree
of a vertex v is d(v). An edge is said to be of type-(i  j) if it connects a type-i vertex and a type-j
vertex. A random induced subgraph is obtained by sampling a subset W ⊆ V with |W| = n uniformly
at random without replacement  and forming the induced subgraph  denoted by G(W ). Let Vi be
the number of type-i vertices in the sample and Eij be the number of type-(i  j) edges in the sample.

We have(cid:80)K

For a vertex v in the sample  a pendant edge connects vertex v to a vertex outside the sample. Let
w∈W 1{{w  v} ∈ E} be the number of pendant edges incident to v. Let yi(v) be the
w∈V \W 1{t(w) = i {w  v} ∈ E}.
i=1 yi(v) = ˜d(v). Let ˜Ni = Ni−Vi be the number of type-i nodes outside the sample. We
deﬁne ˜N = ( ˜Ni : 1 ≤ i ≤ K)  p = (pij : 1 ≤ i < j ≤ K)  and y = (yi(v) : v ∈ W  1 ≤ i ≤ K).
We observe only G(W ) and the total degree d(v) of each vertex v in the sample. Assume that we
know the type of each vertex in the sample. The observed data D consists of G(W )  (d(v) : v ∈ W )
and (t(v) : v ∈ W ); i.e.  D = (G(W )  (d(v) : v ∈ W )  (t(v) : v ∈ W )).
Problem 1. Given the observed data D  estimate the size N of the vertex set N = |V | and the size
of each community Ni.

Fig. 1 illustrates the vertex set size estimation problem. White nodes are of type-1 and gray nodes
are of type-2. All nodes outside G(W ) are unobserved. We observe the types and the total degree
of each vertex in the sample. Thus we know the number of pendant edges that connect each vertex
in the sample to other  unsampled vertices. However  the destinations of these pendant edges are
unknown to us.

3 Network Scale-Up Estimator
We brieﬂy outline a simple and intuitive estimator for N = |V | that will serve as a comparison
to PULSE. The network scale-up method (NSUM) is a simple estimator for the vertex set size of
Erd˝os-Rényi random graphs. It has been used in real-world applications to estimate the size of
hidden or hard-to-reach populations such as drug users [12]  HIV-infected individuals [11  22  23] 
men who have sex with men (MSM) [8]  and homeless people [14]. Consider a random graph
that follows the Erd˝os-Rényi distribution. The expected sum of total degrees in a random sample

v∈W d(v)(cid:3) = n(N − 1)p. The expected number of edges in the sample is
(cid:1)p  where ES is the number of edges within the sample. A simple estimator of the
(cid:1). Plugging ˆp into into the moment equation and solving

W of vertices is E(cid:2)(cid:80)
E [ES] = (cid:0)n
connection probability p is ˆp = ES/(cid:0)n
for N yields ˆN = 1 + (n − 1)(cid:80)

v∈W d(v)/2ES  often simpliﬁed to ˆNN S = n(cid:80)

[12  11  22  23  8  14  9].
Theorem 1. (Proof in [6]) Suppose G follows a stochastic blockmodel with edge probability pij > 0
for 1 ≤ i  j ≤ K. For any sufﬁciently large sample size  the NSUM is positively biased and
E[ ˆNN S|ES > 0] − N has an asymptotic lower bound E[ ˆNN S|ES > 0] − N (cid:38) N/n − 1  as n
becomes large  where for two sequences {an} and {bn}  an (cid:38) bn means that there exists a sequence
cn such that an ≥ cn ∼ bn; i.e.  an ≥ cn for all n and limn→∞ cn/bn = 1. However  as sample size
goes to inﬁnity  the NSUM becomes asymptotically unbiased.

4 Main Results

NSUM uses only aggregate information about the sum of the total degrees of vertices in the sample
and the number of edges in the sample. We propose a novel algorithm  PULSE  that uses individual
degree  vertex type  and the network structure information. Experiments (Section 5) show that it
outperforms NSUM in terms of both bias and variance.
Given p = (pij : 1 ≤ i < j ≤ K)  the conditional likelihood of the edges in the sample is given by

and the conditional likelihood of the pendant edges is given by

L¬W (D; p) =

˜Ni−yi(v) 

(cid:80)K

where the sum is taken over all yi(v)’s (i = 1  2  3  . . .   K) such that yi(v) ≥ 0 ∀1 ≤ i ≤ K and

i=1 yi(v) = ˜d(v). Thus the total conditional likelihood is L(D; p) = LW (D; p)L¬W (D; p).

If we condition on p and y  the likelihood of the edges within the sample is the same as LW (D; p)
since it does not rely on y  while the likelihood of the pendant edges given p and y is

L¬W (D; p  y) =

Therefore the total
likelihood conditioned on p and y is given by L(D; p  y) =
LW (D; p)L¬W (D; p  y). The conditional likelihood L(D; p) is indeed a function of ˜N. We may view
this as the likelihood of ˜N given the data D and the probabilities p; i.e.  L( ˜N ; D  p) (cid:44) L(D; p). Simi-
and (cid:80)
larly  the likelihood L(D; p  y) conditioned on p and y is a function of ˜N and y. It can be viewed as the
joint likelihood of ˜N and y given the data D and the probabilities p; i.e.  L( ˜N   y; D  p) (cid:44) L(D; p  y) 
1 ≤ i ≤ K  such that yi(v) ≥ 0 and(cid:80)K
y L( ˜N   y; D  p) = L( ˜N ; D  p)  where the sum is taken over all yi(v)’s  v ∈ W and
i=1 yi(v) = ˜d(v)  ∀v ∈ W   ∀1 ≤ i ≤ K. To have a
full Bayesian approach  we assume that the joint prior distribution for ˜N and p is π( ˜N   p). Hence 
ˆ
the population size estimation problem is equivalent to the following optimization problem for ˜N:

Then we estimate the total population size as ˆN =(cid:80)K

We brieﬂy study the regularity of the posterior distribution of N. In order to learn about ˜N  we must
observe enough vertices from each block type  and enough edges connecting members of each block 
so that the ﬁrst and second moments of the posterior distribution exist. Intuitively  in order for the
ﬁrst two moments to exist  either we must observe many edges connecting vertices of each block
type  or we must have sufﬁciently strong prior beliefs about pij.
Theorem 2. (Proof in [6]) Assume that π( ˜N   p) = φ( ˜N )ψ(p) and pij follows the Beta distribution
B(αij  βij) independently for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ K. Let λ = min1≤i≤K
. If φ( ˜N )
is bounded and λ > n + 1  then the n-th moment of N exists.

(cid:16)(cid:80)K

j=1(Eij + αij)

(cid:17)

In particular  if λ > 3  the variance of N exists. Theorem 2 gives the minimum possible number
of edges in the sample to make the posterior sampling meaningful. If the prior distribution of
pij is Uniform[0  1]  then we need at least three edges incident on type-i edges for all types i =
1  2  3  . . .   K to guarantee the existence of the posterior variance.

4.1 Erd˝os-Rényi Model

In order to better understand how PULSE estimates the size of a general stochastic blockmodel
we study the Erd˝os-Rényi case where K = 1  and all vertices are connected independently with
probability p. Let N denote the total population size  W be the sample with size |W| = V1 and
˜N = N − |W|. For each vertex v ∈ W in the sample  let ˜d(v) = y(v) denote the number
of pendant edges of vertex v  and E = E11 is the number of edges within the sample. Then

LW (D; p) = pE(1 − p)(|W |

2 )−E 

L¬W (D; p) =

˜d(v)(1 − p)
p

˜N− ˜d(v).

In the Erd˝os-Rényi case  y(v) = ˜d(v) and thus L¬W (D; p) = L¬W (D; p  y). Therefore  the total
likelihood of ˜N conditioned on p is given by

L( ˜N ; D  p) = LW (D; p)L¬W (D; p) = pE(1 − p)(|W |

4.2 General Stochastic Blockmodel

´

´

In the Erd˝os-Rényi case  y(v) = ˜d(v). However  in the general stochastic blockmodel case 
in addition to the unknown variables ˜N1  ˜N2  . . .   ˜NK to be estimated  we do not know yi(v)
(v ∈ W   i = 1  2  3  . . .   K) either. The expression L¬W (D; p) involves costly summation
over all possibilities of integer composition of ˜d(v) (v ∈ W ). However  the joint posterior dis-
tribution for ˜N and y  which is proportional to
L( ˜N   y; D  p)φ( ˜N )ψ(p)dp  does not involve
summing over integer partitions; thus we may sample from the joint posterior distribution for ˜N
and y  and obtain the marginal distribution for ˜N. Our proposed algorithm PULSE realizes this
idea. Let L( ˜N   y; D) =
L( ˜N   y; D  p)ψ(p)dp. We know that the joint posterior distribution
for ˜N and y  denoted by Pr[ ˜N   y|D]  is proportional to Λ( ˜N   y; D) (cid:44) L( ˜N   y; D)ψ( ˜N ). In ad-
dition  the conditional distributions Pr[ ˜Ni| ˜N¬i  y] and Pr[y(v)| ˜N   y(¬v)] are also proportional to
L( ˜N   y; D)ψ( ˜N )  where ˜N¬i = ( ˜Nj : 1 ≤ j ≤ K  j (cid:54)= i)  y(v) = (yi(v) : 1 ≤ i ≤ K) and
y(¬v) = (y(w) : w ∈ W  w (cid:54)= v). The proposed algorithm PULSE is a Gibbs sampling process that
samples from the joint posterior distribution (i.e.  Pr[ ˜N   y|D])  which is speciﬁed in Algorithm 2.
For every v ∈ W and i = 1  2  3  . . .   K  0 ≤ yi(v) ≤ ˜Ni because the number of type-(i  t(v))
pendant edges of vertex v must not exceed the total number of type-i vertices outside the sample.
Therefore  we have ˜Ni ≥ maxv∈W yi(v) must hold for every i = 1  2  3  . . .   K. These observations
put constraints on the choice of proposal distributions gi and hv  i = 1  2  3  . . .   K and v ∈ W ;
i.e.  the support of gi must be contained in [maxv∈W yi(v) ∞) ∩ N and the support of hv must be

contained in {y(v) : ∀1 ≤ i ≤ K  0 ≤ yi(v) ≤ ˜Ni (cid:80)K

j=1 yi(v) = ˜d(v)}.

5 Experiment

5.1 Erd˝os-Rényi

Effect of Parameter p. We ﬁrst evaluate the performance of PULSE in the Erd˝os-Rényi case. We
ﬁx the size of the network at N = 1000 and the sample size |W| = 280 and vary the parameter p.
For each p ∈ [0.1  0.9]  we sample 100 graphs from G(N  p). For each selected graph  we compute
NSUM and run PULSE 50 times (as it is a randomized algorithm) to compute its performance. We
record the relative errors by the Tukey boxplots shown in Fig. 2a. The posterior mean proposed
by PULSE is an accurate estimate of the size. For the parameter p varying from 0.1 to 0.9  most of
the relative errors are bounded between −1% and 1%. We also observe that the NSUM tends to
overestimate the size as it shows a positive bias. This conﬁrms experimentally the result of Theorem
1. For both methods  the interquartile ranges (IQRs  hereinafter) correlate negatively with p. This
shows that the variance of both estimators shrinks when the graph becomes denser. The relative errors
of PULSE tend to concentrate around 0 with larger p which means that the performance of PULSE
improves with larger p. In contrast  a larger p does not improve the bias of the NSUM.
Effect of Network Size N. We ﬁx the parameter p = 0.3 and the sample size |W| = 280 and vary
the network size N from 400 to 1000. For each N ∈ [400  1000]  we randomly pick 100 graphs from
G(N  p). For each selected graph  we compute NSUM and run PULSE 50 times. We illustrate the
results via Tukey boxplots in Fig. 2b. Again  the estimates given by PULSE are very accurate. Most
of the relative errors reside in [−0.5%  0.5%] and almost all reside in [−1%  1%]. We also observe
that smaller network sizes can be estimated more accurately as PULSE will have a smaller variance.
For example  when the network size is N = 400  almost all of the relative errors are bounded in the
range [−0.7%  0.7%] while for N = 1000  the relative errors are in [−1.5%  1.5%]. This agrees with
our intuition that the performance of estimation improves with a larger sampling fraction. In contrast 
NSUM heavily overestimates the network size as the size increases. In addition  its variance also
correlates positively with network size.
Effect of Sample Size |W|. We study the effect of the sample size |W| on the estimation error. Thus 
we ﬁx the size N = 1000 and the parameter p = 0.3  and we vary the sample size |W| from 100 to
500. For each |W| ∈ [100  500]  we randomly select 100 graphs from G(N  p). For every selected
graph  we compute the NSUM estimate  run PULSE 50 times  and record the relative errors. The
results are presented in Fig. 2c. We observe that for both methods that the IQR shrinks as the sample
size increases; thus a larger sample size reduces the variance of both estimators. PULSE does not
exhibit appreciable bias when the sample size varies from 100 to 500. Again  NSUM overestimates
the size; however  its bias reduces when the sample size becomes large. This reconﬁrms Theorem 1.

5.2 General Stochastic Blockmodel

Effect of Sample Size and Type Partition. Here  we study the effect of the sample size and
the type partition. We set the network size N to 200 and we assume that there are two types of
vertices in this network: type 1 and type 2 with N1 and N2 nodes  respectively. The ratio N1/N
quantiﬁes the type partition. We vary N1/N from 0.2 to 0.8 and the sample size |W| from 40
to 160. For each combination of N1/N and the sample size |W|  we generate 50 graphs with
p11  p22 ∼ Uniform[0.5  1] and p12 = p21 ∼ Uniform[0  min{p11  p22}]. For each graph  we
compute the NSUM and obtain the average relative error. Similarly  for each graph  we run PULSE
10 times in order to compute the average relative error for the 50 graphs and 10 estimates for each
graph. The results are shown as heat maps in Fig. 2d. Note that the color bar on the right side of Fig.

Effect of deviation from the Erd˝os-Rényi model (controlled by ) on the relative error of PULSE in estimating
the number of type-1 and type-2 nodes in the SBM with K = 2. (g) Effect of the number of types K and the
sample size on the population estimation. The percentages are the sampling fractions n/N. The horizontal axis
represents the number of types K that varies from 1 to 6. The vertical axis is the relative error in percentage.

2d is on logarithmic scale. In general  the estimates given by PULSE are very accurate and exhibit
signiﬁcant superiority over the NSUM estimates. The largest relative errors of PULSE in absolute
value  which are approximately 1%  appear in the upper-left and lower-left corner on the heat map.
The performance of the NSUM (see the right subﬁgure in Fig. 2d) is robust to the type partition and
equivalently the ratio N1/N. As we enlarge the sample size  its relative error decreases.
The left subﬁgure in Fig. 2d shows the performance of PULSE. When the sample size is small  the
relative error decreases as N1/N increases from 0.2 to 0.5; when N1/N rises from 0.5 to 0.8  the
relative error becomes large. Given the ﬁxed ratio N1/N  as expected  the relative error declines
when we have a larger sample. This agrees with our observation in the Erd˝os-Rényi case. However 
when the sample size is large  PULSE exhibits better performance when the type partition is more
homogeneous. There is a local minimum relative error in absolute value shown at the center of the
subﬁgure. PULSE performs best when there is a balance between the number of edges in the sampled

induced subgraph and the number of pendant edges emanating outward. Larger sampled subgraphs
allow more precision in knowledge about pij  but more pendant edges allow for better estimation of y 
and hence each Ni. Thus when the sample is about half of the network size  the balanced combination
of the number of edges within the sample and those emanating outward leads to better performance.
Effect of Intra- and Inter-Community Edge Probability. Suppose that there are two types of nodes
in the network. The mean degree is given by dmean = 2
. We want
N
to keep the mean degree constant and vary the random graph gradually so that we observe 3 phases:
high intra-community and low inter-community edge probability (more cohesive)  Erd˝os-Rényi   and
low intra-community and high inter-community edge probability (more incohesive). We introduce a
cohesion parameter . In the two-block model  we have p11 = p22 = p01 = ˜p  where ˜p is a constant.
  p12 = ˜p− .
Let’s call  the deviation from this situation and let p11 = ˜p + N1N2
2(N1
2 )
The mean degree stays constant for different . In addition  p11  p12 and p22 must reside in [0  1].
This requirement can be met if we set the absolute value of  small enough. By changing  from
positive to negative we go from cohesive behavior to incohesive behavior. Clearly  for  = 0  the
graph becomes an Erd˝os-Rényi graph with p11 = p22 = p01 = ˜p.
We set the network size N to 850  N1 to 350  and N2 to 500. We ﬁx ˜p = 0.5 and let  vary from −0.3
to 0.3. When  = 0.3  the intra-community edge probabilities are p11 = 0.9298 and p22 = 0.7104
and the inter-community edge probability is p12 = 0.2. When  = −0.3  the intra-community
edge probabilities are p11 = 0.0702 and p22 = 0.2896 and the inter-community edge probability is
p12 = 0.8. For each   we generate 500 graphs and for each graph  we run PULSE 50 times. Given
each value of   relative errors are shown in box plots. We present the results in Fig. 2e as we vary
. From Fig. 2e  we observe that despite deviation from the Erd˝os-Rényi graph  both methods are
robust. However  the ﬁgure indicates that PULSE is unbiased (as median is around zero) while NSUM
overestimates the size on average. This again conﬁrms Theorem 1.
An important feature of PULSE is that it can also estimate the number of nodes of each type while
NSUM cannot. The results for type-1 and type-2 with different  are shown in Fig. 2f. We observe
that the median of all boxes agree with the 0% line; thus the separate estimates for N1 or N2 are
unbiased. Note that when the edge probabilities are more homogeneous (i.e.  when the graph becomes
more similar to the Erd˝os-Rényi model) the IQRs  as well as the interval between the two ends of the
whiskers  become larger. This shows that when we try to ﬁt an Erd˝os-Rényi model (a single-type
stochastic blockmodel) into a two-type model  the variance becomes larger.
Effect of Number of Types and Sample Size. Finally  we study the impact of the number of types
K and the sample size |W| = n on the relative error. To generate graphs with different number of
types  we use a Chinese restaurant process (CRP) [1]. We set the total number of vertices to 200  ﬁrst
pick 100 vertices and use the Chinese restaurant process to assign them to different types. Suppose
that CRP gives K types; We then distribute the remaining 100 vertices evenly among the K types.
The edge probability pii (1 ≤ i ≤ K) is sampled from Uniform[0.7  1] and pij (1 ≤ i < j ≤ K) is
sampled from Uniform[0  min{pii  pjj}]  all independently. We set the sampling fraction n/N to
33%  50% and 66%  and use NSUM and PULSE to estimate the network size. Relative estimation
errors are illustrated in Fig. 2g. We observe that with the same sampling fraction n/N and same
the number of types K  PULSE has a smaller relative error than that of the NSUM. Similarly  the
interquartile range of PULSE is also smaller than that of the NSUM. Hence  PULSE provides a higher
accuracy with a smaller variance. For both methods the relative error decreases (in absolute value) as
the sampling fraction increases. Accordingly  the IQRs also shrink for larger sampling fraction. With
the sampling fraction ﬁxed  the IQRs become larger when we increase the number of types in the
graph. The variance of both methods increases for increasing values of K. The median of NSUM is
always above 0 on average which indicates that it overestimates the network size.
