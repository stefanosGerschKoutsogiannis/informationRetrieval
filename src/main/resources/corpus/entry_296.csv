Abstract

Inferring effective connectivity between spatially segregated brain regions is impor-
tant for understanding human brain dynamics in health and disease. Non-invasive
neuroimaging modalities  such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)  are often used to make measurements and
infer connectivity. However most studies do not consider integrating the two modal-
ities even though each is an indirect measure of the latent neural dynamics and
each has its own spatial and/or temporal limitations. In this study  we develop a
linear state-space model to infer the effective connectivity in a distributed brain
network based on simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI data. Our method ﬁrst
identiﬁes task-dependent and subject-dependent regions of interest (ROI) based
on the analysis of fMRI data. Directed inﬂuences between the latent neural states
at these ROIs are then modeled as a multivariate autogressive (MVAR) process
driven by various exogenous inputs. The latent neural dynamics give rise to the ob-
served scalp EEG measurements via a biophysically informed linear EEG forward
model. We use a mean-ﬁeld variational Bayesian approach to infer the posterior
distribution of latent states and model parameters. The performance of the model
was evaluated on two sets of simulations. Our results emphasize the importance
of obtaining accurate spatial localization of ROIs from fMRI. Finally  we applied
the model to simultaneously recorded EEG-fMRI data from 10 subjects during a
Face-Car-House visual categorization task and compared the change in connectivity
induced by different stimulus categories.

Introduction

Identifying the spatiotemporal dependence among distributed cortical regions is often seen as crucial
for understanding the macro-scale neural dynamics underlying human cognition. Such spatiotemporal
dependencies can be quantiﬁed statistically by the modeling of effective connectivity  which is deﬁned
as the time-lagged inﬂuence of one brain region over another [1]. Effective connectivity has been
introduced in the framework of dynamic causal modeling (DCM). DCM uses a state-space model with
hidden state variables to describe task-dependent "causal" interactions between latent neural states
and how the activity of regional neural states translates into observed neural measurements [2  3].
Estimating effective connectivity between anatomically segregated brain regions is a challenging
problem for several reasons: 1) the inference is made on unobserved latent states rather than directly
on the observations; 2) latent neural dynamics often evolve on a fast time scale so it requires the

33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019)  Vancouver  Canada.

observation time series to be measured on a similar temporal scale; 3) accurate spatial localization of
the activated brain regions is often a prerequisite for the speciﬁcation of a meaningful dynamic causal
model.
To address these challenges  a number of state-space based modeling techniques have been developed
and applied to a variety of non-invasive neuroimage modalities such as electroencephalography (EEG)/
magnetoencephalography (MEG)  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)  and functional
near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Modalities like EEG and MEG with high temporal resolution
offer advantages in terms of measuring and inferring effective connectivity. Cheung et al. [4]
proposed a state-space model where the latent neural dynamics at pre-deﬁned ROIs were modeled as
a multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) process. They assumed a known EEG forward model with
unknown spatial distribution of the EEG sources within each ROI. Haufe et al. [5] used a similar
MVAR approach to model the connectivity in EEG source space where the spatial source demixing
was optimized jointly with the connectivity estimation. David et al. [6] used a nonlinear hierarchical
neural mass model for the "casual" modeling of evoked responses in EEG/MEG. Another model
for evoked responses in MEG/EEG was proposed by Yang et al. [7] where a time-varying MVAR
model was used to estimate the dynamic connectivity among multiple ROIs. In contrast to the work
by Cheung et al. [4]  they also used a known MEG/EEG forward model for the evoked responses 
but sources within the same ROI were modeled as independent Gaussian variables. Other dynamical
models leveraging the relatively high spatial resolution of fMRI [3  8  9] and fNIRs [10  11] have
also been developed for brain connectivity analysis.
All of these inference methods are based on neural measurements from a single modality  and therefore
suffer from potentially suboptimal estimates of the true latent neural dynamics due to the limitation in
spatial or temporal resolution of the modality. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI is a neuroimaging technique
that leverages the complementary strengths of both modalities  namely 3D spatial resolution of fMRI
and temporal resolution of EEG. Given that the data from two modalities are recorded under identical
experimental conditions  one can use fMRI activations as a spatial prior to improve the accuracy of
EEG source localization [12  13  14].
In this paper we propose a linear state-space model for estimating the effective connectivity using  as
observations  data from simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI. Our goal is to combine EEG with
fMRI to arrive at estimates of the latent neural dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolution. Since
fMRI offers signiﬁcant advantage over EEG in terms of spatially localizing potential source activity 
we ﬁrst identify task-speciﬁc ROIs from the analysis of fMRI data on each individual subject. The
locations of these ROIs are used as spatial constraints to inform the effective connectivity modeling
of EEG. Similar to the ROI source model proposed by Yang et al. [7]  we also model the latent state
variables as the mean source activity at each ROI. Each source inside one ROI follows a Gaussian
distribution with the ROI mean and a shared unknown variance parameter. In contrast to [7]  we model
the state equation as an MVAR process  which describes the directed interactions between latent states
driven by deterministic inputs speciﬁc to an experiment. Inputs can directly inﬂuence the activity at a
particular region (external input) or they can modulate the connectivity between regions. Finally  an
EEG forward model based on a pre-estimated lead ﬁeld matrix was constructed together with the
ROI source model to generate scalp EEG observations. We use a mean-ﬁeld variational Bayesian
approach to infer the posterior distribution of latent variables and model parameters. The posterior
estimates are updated efﬁciently via a sequential Kalman ﬁlter and the use of conjugate priors. We
evaluated the model performance on two sets of simulations and demonstrated the importance of
the spatial speciﬁcity provided by fMRI. We then applied the state-space model to simultaneously
EEG-fMRI recordings from 10 subjects during a face-car-house rapid decision-making task.

2 Model

Model description Our linear state-space model for inferring the latent neural dynamics consists of
a state equation and two observation equations for EEG. In the state equation  we model the temporal
dependence between latent state variables as a ﬁrst-order MVAR process in the presence of external
and context-dependent inputs:

st = Ast−1 +

Bkmk

t st−1 + Dut + ωt

(1)

K(cid:88)

where st is an S × 1 vector of latent state variables at time t. Each element in st represents the
mean activity of all EEG sources within one of S ROIs. A is an S × S intrinsic connectivity matrix
wherein each entry denotes the connection strength between a pair of latent variables in the absence
t   where k = 1  2  ...K  represents the kth modulatory input at time t. Bk ∈ RS×S is the
of input. mk
kth modulatory connectivity matrix where each element denotes the change in connectivity induced
t . ut is an S × 1 vector that denotes the external input at each ROI and
by the modulatory input mk
D is an S × S diagonal matrix whose diagonal element denotes the strength of ut. ωt ∈ RS×1 is a
Gaussian state noise vector at time t with a zero mean and a diagonal covariance matrix Qs. This
bilinear model used to approximate the latent state dynamics modulated by task demand is similar to
that in [3].
The observation model for EEG consists of two equations. We used a volumetric source model which
assumes that EEG sources are uniformly distributed on a 3-D grid inside the brain. The position and
the orientation of each source (dipole) is ﬁxed and pre-estimated from real data in this model. Source
activity xt propagates through brain tissues and generates EEG potentials yt measured by electrodes
placed on the scalp via the following linear forward model:

yt = Lxt + et 

(2)
where yt ∈ RM×1 is the EEG observations measured from M channels at time t. xt ∈ RU×1is the
activity of U EEG sources at time t. L ∈ RM×U is the lead ﬁeld matrix that describes the mapping
from EEG source space to channel space. L in our model was pre-computed by solving the EEG
forward modeling problem [15]. et is an M × 1 vector that models the noise at each channel as
a Gaussian with zero mean and covariance matrix Qy. Solving xt from yt is called EEG inverse
modeling or source localization. It is an ill-posed problem since U (cid:29) M. Many EEG source
localization methods such as minimum-norm estimation (MNE) [16] require the estimate of Qy from
baseline data. The solution to EEG source localization is not unique and often not robust  especially
based on EEG data alone. Therefore  we did not model each single source in the whole brain as
a latent variable. Similar as in [7]  the source activity xt in our model is composed of the latent
variables st by the following equation:

xt = Gst + t

(3)
where G ∈ RU×S is a binary indicator matrix. Each row of G is a one-hot vector that encodes the
membership of each source in one of the ROIs. t ∈ RU×1 is a Gaussian noise term with zero mean
and U × U diagonal covariance matrix Qx. Consequently  each source in xt is Gaussian distributed
around its corresponding ROI mean in st with a variance σ2
r   r = 1  . . .   S speciﬁed in the diagonal
elements of Qx . If a source in xt is not contained in any ROI  it is modeled as a Gaussian variable
with a zero mean and variance σ2
0. This model assumes that all sources in the rthROI have the same
r  while sources that do not belong to any ROI have the same variance parameter
variance parameter σ2
0. Therefore  there are only S + 1 distinct elements in the diagonal of Qx.
σ2
Substituting (3) into (2) and eliminating xt  the EEG observation model can be expressed as:

(4)
where C = LG is a known M × S matrix and φt is the Gaussian noise term at time t with a zero
mean and an M × M covariance matrix R = Qy + LQxL(cid:48). L(cid:48) denotes the transpose of L.
Taken together  our linear state-space model can be expressed as (see Figure 1 for illustration):

yt = Cst + φt

where q(S  θ) is an arbitrary density from a family of variational distributions. It is easy to show that
the ELBO objective is maximized when q(S  θ) = p(S  θ|Y). Since p(S  θ|Y) is often intractable 
we choose a density from the mean-ﬁeld variational family having the form q(S  θ) = q(S|Y)q(θ|Y)
to approximate p(S  θ|Y). The solution that maximizes L(q) satisﬁes [17]:

log q(S|Y) ∝ Eθ(log p(S  θ  Y))

variables at every time t. More details of the derivation are provided in Appendix.

we choose a Gaussian-Gamma conjugate prior according to the principle of automatic relevance
determination (ARD). ARD assigns a separate shrinkage prior to each element of the connectivity
matrices which in turn is adjusted by a hyper-prior [17  18]. It encourages a sparse structure in the
connectivity matrices to enhance interpretability. The use of conjugate priors also allows one to
obtain closed-form solution for the posterior updates of model parameters. Since we assume the state
noise covariance Qs to be diagonal  we can estimate each row in the model parameters θS separately.
Speciﬁcally  the rth row of the state equation can be expressed as:

3 Results

We ﬁrst evaluated the performance of the state-space model on simulated datasets and then applied
the model to real simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI data (see more details in Appendix). In
the simulation study  we assessed the performance of the model when spatial localization of ROIs
is inaccurate  simulating the scenario when fMRI information is not available. We generated two
simulation scenarios corresponding to two different types of EEG-fMRI experiment designs: a block
design and an event-related design. For analysis of the real simultaneous EEG-fMRI data  we applied
the state-space model on the EEG data recorded simultaneously with fMRI to infer the induced
connectivity change between brain regions activated during a Face-Car-House visual categorization
task. Combining the subject-speciﬁc fMRI activation maps and the EEG temporal dynamics enabled
us to compare differences in modulatory connectivity induced by face stimuli vs. house stimuli.

3.1 Simulations

Scenario 1: Block Design We simulated the latent dynamics in the brain network consisting of
S = 5 ROIs using the structure shown in Figure 2A. The external input was modeled as a sequence of
impulse functions with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) uniformly drawn between 2 s to 2.5 s (longer
than the fMRI repetition time TR=2 s). The modulatory input was modeled as alternating on-off
blocks with a block duration of 20 s to simulate a block design fMRI experiment where change
in the network connectivity could be induced by stimulus presentation or alternation of cognitive
states (such as attention and salience). The external input feeds into FFA with a strength of 0.9 and
the modulatory input changes the connection strength from SPL to PPA and from ACC to FEF. In
particular  the direction of the modulatory connection from SPL to PPA is opposite to that of the
intrinsic connection between them. The state covariance Qs was set to be the identity matrix. The
ROI variance σ2
r   r = 0  1  . . .   S in Qx was drawn from a Gamma distribution Γ(0.2  1) whose
shape and scale parameters were estimated from real data. The EEG measurement noise covariance
Qy was also estimated from real data during the baseline period. We simulated the latent ROI mean

activity and EEG data for a duration of T = 8 min with a sampling rate of 100 Hz. The unit of the
simulated EEG measurements was microvolt.
Scenario 2: Event-related Design To mimic a more realistic EEG-fMRI experiment design  we
simulated two modulatory inputs that induce different connectivity patterns shown in Figure 2B. The
modulatory inputs were modeled as a sequence of discrete events with a duration of 2 s. The ISI
was also drawn uniformly from 2 s to 2.5 s so that there was no overlap between the two inputs.
Other parameters were the same as in scenario 1. The aim of this simulation was to test whether
the algorithm could correctly distinguish the modulatory connectivity matrices induced by different
modulatory inputs.
To illustrate the value of the high spatial speciﬁcity provided by fMRI  we simulated an ’EEG-only’
condition where fMRI data was not available. To achieve this  the anatomical region of each ROI
was dilated so that the number of sources erroneously included was approximately 30% of the total
number of true sources across 5 ROIs. The direct outcome of this spatial smearing was that more
rows in G would have nonzero entries. In the absence of fMRI data  one typically has to deﬁne
ROIs based on atlases deﬁned based on structural brain images  which may cause inaccurate spatial
localization of ROIs. We compared the performance of the algorithm between the ’EEG-fMRI’ and
the ’EEG-only’ conditions to highlight the importance of the spatial resolution added by fMRI.
Ten independent simulation datasets were generated for each scenario. For each simulation dataset 
we applied the EEG-fMRI method and the EEG-only method separately. Since we simulated relatively
large samples  we chose small non-informative priors for the model parameters. Two methods were
initialized with the same set of parameters (see Appendix). The performance of the algorithm in
recovering the intrinsic and modulatory connectivity matrices A and B as well as the noise covariance
matrices Qs and R was evaluated using the relative error between the true and estimated values
deﬁned as:

||Xtrue||F

(19)
where || · ||F is the Frobenius norm of a matrix. Statistical inference on the entries of the connectivity
matrices is straightforward since they have Gaussian posteriors. Prior to calculating the relative error
of A and B  we thresholded each connection according to its posterior distribution at P < 0.05 with
Bonferroni correction to account for multiple comparison (N=108). Figure 2 shows the comparison
of the relative error between the two methods. For both simulation scenarios  EEG-fMRI method
generated more accurate estimation than EEG-only method. In our EEG-only simulation  even though
only a small number of sources (38) that did not contribute to the underlying dynamics was falsely
assigned to all ROIs  the performance largely decreased. In practice  without the fMRI data  one
would only get more inaccurate spatial localization of ROIs.

3.2 Simultaneous EEG-fMRI Data

We then applied our state-space model method on simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI data from
10 subjects. The data were recorded when subjects performed an event-related three-choice visual
categorization task. On each trial  an image of a face  car  or house was presented at random for 100
ms. The ISI ranged uniformly between 2 s and 2.5 s. Subjects reported their choice of the image
category by pressing one of the three buttons on an MR-compatible button response pad. Each subject
completed 4 runs of the categorization task. In each run  there were 180 trials (60 per category) with
a total duration of 560 s. Previous studies [21  22] have implicated two spatially and temporally
separate brain networks (which we term the ’early’ and ’late’ networks) during this rapid perceptual
decision task based on an EEG-informed fMRI analysis approach. However  the latent brain dynamics
were inferred from the fMRI data  which ﬂuctuate on a much slower timescale than the latent neural
processes. In this study  we leveraged the high temporal resolution of the EEG data in combination
with the high spatial speciﬁcity of fMRI to estimate the latent brain dynamics underlying behavior in
this task. In particular  we selected 3 regions (FFA  PPA  SPL) from the early network and 3 regions
(ACC  premotor cortex  FEF) from the late network that constituent a brain network of 6 ROIs (Figure
3A). We added premotor cortex (PMC) in our analysis because the task involved motor planning
and execution. FFA and PPA were determined based on a separate functional localizer task for each
subject and they were included because of their selectivity in the early sensory processing of faces
and houses. SPL  ACC and FEF have all been shown to involve at different stages of the perceptual
decision-making. The ROIs were determined based on a group-level EEG-informed fMRI analysis in
the standard space but were then transformed back into each subject’s native anatomical space.
Statistical inference For each subject  we ﬁtted the model to each of the 4 runs separately. The
estimated modulatory connectivity matrices corresponding to face and house were z-scored and
thresholded according to their posterior probability. We then performed a two-tailed z-test on the
mean z-scored connectivity values across 40 runs from 10 subjects. Signiﬁcance was determined at
p < 0.05 with Bonferroni correction to account for multiple comparisons across three connectivity
matrices. Signiﬁcant differences between face and house networks was determined using a paired t-
test on the z-scored connections at p < 0.05. Figure 3B shows the mean network connectivity pattern
for face and house stimuli  respectively. Since both positive connections and negative connections are
meaningful  we showed the absolute value of all signiﬁcant connections.
We consider the effective connectivity we infer with respect to differences between face stimuli
and house stimuli. Faces and houses are object types often used in fMRI and EEG studies to study
object recognition and decision-making. Each of these stimulus categories is known to preferentially
activate different regions of the brain (FFA for faces and PPA for houses/places). These stimuli are
also interesting in this context since they are selected so that the organization of the features making
up the objects overlaps (eyes and windows in same relative positions as are nose and door) and thus
can be challenging to discriminate in the presence of visual noise and rapid stimulus presentation.
Our results show that effective connectivity differences are apparent  speciﬁcally we see an increase
in effective connectivity when a house is presented relative to when the stimulus is a face. The
speciﬁc connections contributing to this difference are shown in Figure 3C. Interestingly  these
differences involve connections with the ACC as well as the FEF and FFA  which are areas implicated
in cognitive control  decision monitoring  attention and object recognition  especially of faces. The
fact that the connections are more engaged for house stimuli suggests that there is more of a need to
link these areas when a house is presented relative to a face–i.e this additional connectivity is required
for recognizing a house relative to a face. Previous work [21] showed that network connectivity is
likely a source of how bias effects toward faces are manifested in our choices. This current  though
preliminary result  suggests that overcoming this bias requires additional network connectivity.

4 Discussion

Leveraging the complementary strengths of EEG and fMRI  we proposed a linear state-space model
to estimate the effective connectivity between spatially segregated but functionally integrated brain
regions. Speciﬁcally  we focused on the analysis of effective connectivity driven by various context-
dependent inputs. We modeled the latent state variables as the mean source activity in each ROI
and assumed that all source points belonging to one ROI are independent Gaussian variables with a
shared variance and common ROI mean  similar to the model proposed by [7]. However  our model
also exploits the simultaneously recorded fMRI data to generate task-dependent ROIs speciﬁc to

each individual subject. Since the ROIs identiﬁed by fMRI are much smaller and more localized than
those deﬁned by an atlas on a standard brain  it was more reasonable to assume that all sources within
one ROI have similar activity. Moreover  important ROIs activated in the task were less likely to be
neglected when fMRI information was available. Our simulation study further demonstrated that the
estimation error largely increased even when a small number of spurious sources were included in
each ROI. Together our results show that the high spatial speciﬁcity provided by fMRI is critical to
ROI based connectivity analysis.
Our model substantially differs from [7] in that it is designed to explain continuously evolving EEG
recordings as opposed to epoched EEG responses. Yang et al. [7] modeled the dynamic connectivity
on stimulus-locked evoked responses  a reasonable approach when one is interested in the effect
speciﬁc to a single class of stimulus. On the other hand  our approach allows one to incorporate
multiple exogenous covariates either as external or modulatory inputs in the dynamical system so
that one can investigate the causal effects of multiple experimental manipulations simultaneously.
In essence  the learned latent neural dynamics become a low dimensional representation of the
observed EEG dynamics. Our simulation showed that the algorithm could separate the connectivity
matrices induced by different stimuli  even when the sign of the intrinsic and modulatory connectivity
was opposite to each other. Since the number of parameters is large in this case  we used sparsity
regularization via ARD prior to yield more interpretable results. Nevertheless  our model can also
be easily modiﬁed to analyze connectivity for resting state experiments. Furthermore  since it is
often difﬁcult to acquire large samples of simultaneous EEG-fMRI data and the interpretability of the
model is important  we chose a biophysically informed linear EEG forward model as opposed to a
deep-learning based approach [23  24].
One limitation of our model is that we assumed the state noise covariance Qs to be diagonal. This is
often not true in practice. We also assumed that the sources in the same ROI are independent Gaussian
distributed  i.e. Qx is diagonal. But these sources could be both spatially and temporally dependent.
With the available fMRI information  we can potentially design a more complex spatiotemporal
structure for Qx. In this work  we chose to optimize R directly. An alternative approach is to keep
Qy ﬁxed and only optimize with respect to Qx. We did not compare the difference between the two
approaches  but optimizing over R can be easily done via conjugacy.
Since our model solves the ill-posed EEG inverse problem implicitly  we used information from
fMRI as spatial prior to solve the EEG source localization using MNE  and obtained a reasonable
initial guess for our algorithm. Another limitation is that we assumed a ﬁxed dipole orientation in
the lead ﬁeld matrix and this orientation was estimated based on MNE. In future work  we plan to
treat the dipole orientation as unknown parameter over which to optimize. Finally  the temporally
continuous nature of our estimation scheme provides an easy framework to incorporate fMRI time
series at each ROI so that temporal information from both EEG and fMRI can be used to infer the
latent neural dynamics. Our future work will investigate different choices of generative models for
fMRI signals to better integrate with EEG.
