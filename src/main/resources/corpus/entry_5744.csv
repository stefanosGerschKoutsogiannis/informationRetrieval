Abstract

We study a simple variant of the von Neumann model of an expanding economy 
in which multiple producers make goods according to their endowed production
function. The players trade their goods at the market and then use the bundles
acquired as inputs for the production in the next round. The decision that players
have to make is how to invest their money (i.e. bids) in each round.

We show that a simple decentralized dynamic  where players update their bids
proportionally to how useful the investments were in the past round  leads to growth
of the economy in the long term (whenever growth is possible) but also creates
unbounded inequality  i.e. very rich and very poor players emerge. We analyze
several other phenomena  such as how the relation of a player with others inﬂuences
its development and the Gini index of the system. 1
