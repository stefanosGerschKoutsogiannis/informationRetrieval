Abstract

We consider a seller with an unlimited supply of a single good  who is faced with
a stream of T buyers. Each buyer has a window of time in which she would like
to purchase  and would buy at the lowest price in that window  provided that this
price is lower than her private value (and otherwise  would not buy at all). In this
setting  we give an algorithm that attains O(T2/3) regret over any sequence of T
buyers with respect to the best ﬁxed price in hindsight  and prove that no algorithm
can perform better in the worst case.

Introduction

Perhaps the most common way to sell items is using a “posted price” mechanism in which the seller
publishes the price of an item in advance  and buyers that wish to obtain the item decide whether to
acquire it at the given price or to forgo the purchase. Such mechanisms are extremely appealing. The
decision made by the buyer in a single-shot interaction is simple: if it values the item by more than
the offering price  it should buy  and if its valuation is lower  it should decline. The seller on the other
hand needs to determine the price at which she wishes to sell goods. In order to set prices  additive
regret can be minimized using  for example  a multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithm in which arms
correspond to a different prices  and rewards correspond to the revenue obtained by the seller.
Things become much more complicated when the buyers who are facing the mechanism are patient
and can choose to wait for the price to drop. The simplicity of posted price mechanisms is then
tainted by strategic considerations  as buyers attempt to guess whether or not the seller will lower
the price in the future. The direct application of MABs is no longer adequate  as prices set by such
algorithms may ﬂuctuate at every time period. Strategic buyers can make use of this fact to gain
the item at a lower price  which lowers the revenue of the seller and  more crucially  changes the
seller’s feedback for a given price. With patient buyers  the revenue from sales is no longer a result
of the price at the current period alone  but rather the combined outcome of prices that were set in
surrounding time periods  and of the expectation of buyers regarding future prices.
In this paper  we focus on strategic buyers that may delay their purchase in hopes of obtaining a
better deal. We assume that each buyer has a valuation for the item  and a “patience level” which
represents the length of the time-window during which it is willing to wait in order to purchase the
item. Buyers wish to minimize the price during this period. Note that such buyers may interfere with
naïve attempts to minimize regret  as consecutive days at which different prices are set are no longer
independent.

To regain the simplicity of posted prices for the buyers  we consider a setting in which the seller
commits to the price in subsequent time periods in advance  publishing prices for the entire window
of the buyers. Strategic buyers that arrive at the market are then able to immediately choose the
lowest price within their window. Thus  given the valuation and patience of the buyers (the number
of days they are willing to wait) their actions are clearly determined: buy it at a day that is within the
buyer’s patience window and price is cheapest  provided that it is lower than the valuation.
An important aspect of our proposed model is to consider for each buyer a window of time (rather
than  for example  discounting). For example  when considering discounting  the buyers  in order
to best respond  would have argue how would other buyers would behave and how would the seller
adjust the prices in response to them. By ﬁxing a window of time  and forcing the seller to publish
prices for the entire window  the buyers become “price takers” and their behavior becomes tractable
to analyze.
As in previous works  we focus on minimizing the additive regret of the seller  assuming that the
appearance of buyers is adversarial; that is  we do not make any statistical assumptions on the buyers’
valuation and window size (except for a simple upper bound). Speciﬁcally we assume that the values
are in the range [0  1] and that the window size is in the range {1  . . .   ˆ⌧ + 1}. The regret is measured
with respect to the best single price in hindsight. Note that the benchmark of a ﬁxed price p⇤ implies
that any buyer with value above p⇤ buys and any buyer with value below p⇤ does not buy. The window
size has no effect when we have a ﬁxed price. On the other hand  for the online algorithm  having to
deal with various window sizes create a new challenge.
The special case of this model where ˆ⌧ = 0 (and hence all buyers have window of size exactly one)
was previously studied by Kleinberg and Leighton [11]  who discussed a few different models for
the buyer valuations and derived tight regret bounds for them. When the set of feasible prices is of
constant size their result implies a ⇥(pT) regret bound with respect to the best ﬁxed price  which
is also proven to be the best possible in that case. In contrast  in the current paper we focus on
the case ˆ⌧  1  where the buyers’ window sizes may be larger than one  and exhibit the following
contributions:
(i) We present an algorithm that achieves O( ˆ⌧1/3T2/3) additive regret in an adversarial setting 
compared to the best ﬁxed posted price in hindsight. The upper bound relies on creating epochs 
when the price within each epoch is ﬁxed and the number of epochs limit the number of times
the seller switches prices. The actual algorithm that is used to select prices within an epoch is
EXP3 (or can be any other multi-arm bandit algorithm with similar performance).

(ii) We exhibit a matching lower bound of ⌦( ˆ⌧1/3T2/3) regret. The proof of the lower bound reveals
that the difﬁculty in achieving lower regret stems from the lost revenue that the seller suffers
every time she tries to lower costs. Buyers from preceding time slots wait and do not purchase
the items at the higher prices that prevailed when they arrive. We are thus able to prove a lower
bound by reducing to a multi-armed bandit problem with switching costs. Our lower bound
uses only two prices.

In other words  we see that as soon as the buyers’ patience increases from zero to one  the optimal

regret rate immediately jumps from ⇥(pT) to ⇥(T2/3).

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the remainder of this section we brieﬂy overview
related work. We then proceed in Section 2 to provide a formal deﬁnition of the model and the
statement of our main results. We continue in Section 3 with a presentation of our algorithm and its
analysis  present our lower bound in Section 4  and conclude with a brief discussion.

1.1 Related work

As mentioned above  the work most closely related to ours is the paper of Kleinberg and Leighton
[11] that studies the case ˆ⌧ = 0  i.e.  in which the buyers’ windows are limited to be all of size one.
For a ﬁxed set of feasible prices of constant size  their result implies a ⇥(pT) regret bound  whereas
for a continuum of prices they achieve a ⇥(T2/3) regret bound. The ⌦(T2/3) lower bound found in
[11] is similar to our own in asymptotic magnitude  but stems from the continuous nature of the prices.
In our case the lower bound is achieved for buyers with only 2 prices  a case in which Kleinberg
and Leighton [11] have a bound of ⇥(pT). Hence  we show that such a bound can occur due to the

strategic nature of the interaction itself.

A line of work appearing in [1  12  13] considers a model of a single buyer and a single seller  where
the buyer is strategic and has a constant discount factor. The main issue is that the buyer continuously
interacts with the seller and thus has an incentive to lower future prices at the cost of current valuations.
They deﬁne strategic regret and derive near optimal strategic regret bounds for various valuation
models. We differ from this line of work in a few important ways. First  they consider other either
ﬁxed unknown valuation or stochastic i.i.d. valuations  while we consider adversarial valuations.
Second  they consider a single buyer while we consider a stream of buyers. More importantly  in
our model the buyers do not inﬂuence the prices they are offered  so the strategic incentives are very
different. Third  their model uses discounting to model the decay of buyer valuation over time  while
we use a window of time.
There is a vast literature in Algorithmic Game Theory on revenue maximization with posted prices 
in settings where agents’ valuations are drawn from unknown distributions. For the case of a single
good of unlimited supply  the goal is to approximate the best price  as a function of the number
of samples observed and with a multiplicative approximation ratio. The work of Balcan et al. [4]
gives a generic reduction which can be used to show that one can achieve an ✏-optimal pricing with
a sample of size O((H/✏2) log(H/✏))  where H is a bound on the maximum valuation. The works
of Cole and Roughgarden [8] and Huang et al. [10] show that for regular and Monotone Hazard
Rate distributions sample bounds of ⇥(✏3) and ⇥(✏3/2)  respectively  guarantee a multiplicative
approximation of 1  ✏.
Finally  our setting is somewhat similar to a unit-demand auction in which agents desire a single
item out of several offerings. In our case  we can consider items sold at different times as different
items and agents desire a single one that is within their window. When agents have unit-demand
preferences  posted-price mechanisms can extract a constant fraction of the optimal revenue [5  6  7].
Note that a constant ratio approximation algorithm implies a linear regret in our model. On the other
hand  these works consider a more involved problem from a buyer’s valuation perspective.

2 Setup and Main Results

We consider a setting with a single seller and a sequence of T buyers b1  . . .   bT . Every buyer bt is
associated with value vt 2[ 0  1] and patience ⌧t. A buyer’s patience indicates the time duration in
which the buyer stays in the system and may purchase an item.
The seller posts prices in advance over some time window. Let ˆ⌧ be the maximum patience  and
assume that ⌧t  ˆ⌧ for every t. Let pt denote the price at time t  and assume that all prices are chosen
n  2
from a discrete (and normalized) predeﬁned set of n prices P = {0  1
n  . . . 1}. At time t = 1  the
seller posts prices p1  . . .   pˆ⌧+1  and learns the revenue obtained at time t = 1 (the revenue depends
on the buyers’ behavior  which is explained below). Then  at each time step t  the seller publishes
a new price pt+ˆ⌧ 2 P  and learns the revenue obtained at time t  which she can use to set the next
prices. Note that at every time step  prices are known for the next ˆ⌧ time steps.
The revenue in every time step is determined by the strategic behavior of buyers  which is explained
next. Every buyer bt observes prices pt  . . .   pt+⌧t   and purchases the item at the lowest price among
these prices (breaking ties toward earlier times)  if she does not exceed her value. The revenue
obtained from buyer bt is given by:

(pt  . . .   pt+ˆ⌧; bt) =⇢min{pt  . . .   pt+⌧t }

0

if min{pt  . . .   pt+⌧t } vt 
otherwise.

As bt has patience ⌧t  we will sometime omit the irrelevant prices and write (pt  . . .   pt+⌧t ; bt) =
(pt  . . .   pt+ˆ⌧; bt).
As we described  a buyer need not buy the item on her day of appearance and may choose to wait.
If the buyer chooses to wait  we will observe the feedback from her decision only on the day of
purchase. We therefore need to distinguish between the revenue from buyer t and the revenue at time
t. Given a sequence of prices p1  . . .   pt+ˆ⌧ and a sequence of buyers b1  . . .   bt we deﬁne the revenue
at time t to be the sum of all revenues from buyers that preferred to buy at time t. Formally  let It
denote the set of all buyers that buy at time t  i.e. 

It = {bi : t = arg min{i  t  i + ⌧i : pt = (pi . . .   pi+ˆ⌧; bi)}}.

3

Then the revenue obtained at time t is given by:

where we use the notation b1:T as a shorthand for the sequence b1  . . .   bT . The regret of the (possibly
randomized) seller A is the difference between the revenue obtained by the best ﬁxed price in hindsight
and the expected revenue obtained by the seller A  given a sequence of buyers:

Rt(ptˆ⌧  . . .   pt+ˆ⌧) = R(p1  . . .   pt+ˆ⌧; b1:t) :=’i2It
R(p⇤  . . .   p⇤; b1:t) E" T’t=1

RegretT(A; b1:T) = max
p⇤2P

T’t=1

(pi  . . . pi+ˆ⌧; bi)) 

R(p1  . . . pt+ˆ⌧; b1:t)# .

We further denote by RegretT(A) the expected regret a seller A incurs for the worst case sequence 
i.e.  RegretT(A) = maxb1:T RegretT(A; b1:T).
2.1 Main Results

Our main result are optimal regret rates in the strategic buyers setting.
Theorem 1. The T-round expected regret of Algorithm 1 for any sequence of buyers b1  . . .   bT with
patience at most ˆ⌧  1 is upper bounded as RegretT  10( ˆ⌧n log n)1/3T2/3.
Theorem 2. For any ˆ⌧  1  n  2 and for any pricing algorithm  there exists a sequence of buyers
b1  . . .   bT with patience at most ˆ⌧ such that RegretT = ⌦( ˆ⌧1/3T2/3).
3 Algorithm

In this section we describe and analyze our online pricing algorithm. It is worth to start by highlighting
why simply running an “off the shelf” multi-arm bandit algorithm such as EXP3 would fail. Consider
a ﬁxed distribution over the actions and assume the buyer has a window size of two. Unlike the
standard multi-arm bandit  where we get the expected revenue from the price we select  now the
buyer would select the lower of the two prices  which would clearly hurt our revenue (there is a slight
gain  by the increased probability of sell  but it does sufﬁce to offset the loss). For this reason  the
seller would intuitively like to minimize the number of time it changes prices (more precisely  lower
the prices).
Our online pricing algorithm  which is given in Algorithm 1  is based on the EXP3 algorithm of Auer
et al. [3] which we use as a black-box. The algorithm divides the time horizon to roughly T2/3 epochs 
and within each epoch the seller repeatedly announces the same price  that was chosen by the EXP3
black-box in the beginning of the epoch. In the end of the epoch  EXP3 is updated with the overall
average performance of the chosen price during the epoch (ignoring the time steps which might be
inﬂuenced by different prices). Hence  our algorithm changes the posted price only O(T2/3) times 
thereby keeping under control the costs associated with price ﬂuctuations due to the patience of the
buyers.

We now analyze Algorithm 1 and prove Theorem 1. The proof follows standard arguments in
adversarial online learning (e.g.  Arora et al. [2]); we note  however  that for obtaining the optimal
dependence on the maximal patience ˆ⌧ one cannot apply existing results directly and has to analyse
the effect of accumulating revenues over epochs more carefully  as we do in the proof below. This
is mainly because in our model the revenue at time t is not bounded by 1 but by ⌧  hence readily
amenable results would add a factor ⌧ to the regret.
Proof of Theorem 1. For all 0  j  T0 and for all prices p 2 P  deﬁne

R0j(p) =

1
B

B(j+1)’t=B j+2ˆ⌧+1

Rt(p  . . .   p).

(Here  the argument p is repeated 2 ˆ⌧ + 1 times.) Observe that 0  R0j(p) 1 for all j and p  as the
maximal total revenue between rounds B j + 2 ˆ⌧ + 1 and B(j + 1) is at most B; indeed  there are at
most B buyers who might make a purchase during that time  and each purchase yields revenue of at
most 1. By a similar reasoning  we also have

B j+2ˆ⌧’t=B j+1

Rt(p  . . .   p) 4 ˆ⌧

(1)

for all j and p.
Now  notice that pt = p0j for all B j + ˆ⌧ + 1  t  B(j + 1) + ˆ⌧  hence the feedback fed back to A
after epoch j is

That is  Algorithm 1 is essentially running EXP3 on the reward functions R0j. By the regret bound of
EXP3  we know that

Rt(p0j  . . .   p0j) = R0j(p0j).

Finally  for B = b ˆ⌧2/3(n log n)1/3T1/3c  the theorem follows (assuming that ˆ⌧< T).

Summing Eqs. (2) and (3)  and taking into account rounds BT0 + 1  . . .   T during which the total
revenue is at most B + 2 ˆ⌧  we obtain the regret bound

Our proof relies on two steps. The ﬁrst step is a reduction from pricing with patience ˆ⌧ = 0 but with
switching cost. The second step is to lower bound the regret of pricing with switching cost. This we
do again by reduction from the Multi Armed Bandit (MAB) problem with switching cost. We begin
by brieﬂy over-viewing these terms and deﬁnitions.
We recall the standard setting of MAB with two actions and switching cost c. A sequence of losses
is produced `1  . . .  ` T where each loss is deﬁned as a function `t : {1  2}!{ 0  1}. At each round
a player chooses an action it 2{ 1  2} and receives as feedback `t(it). The switching cost regret of
player A is given by

Sc-RegretT(A; `1:T) = E" T’t=1

`t(it) min

`t(i⇤)# + cE[|{it : it   it1}|] .

T’t=1

We will deﬁne analogously the switching cost regret for non-strategic buyers. Namely  given a
sequence of buyers b1  . . .   bT   all with patience ˆ⌧ = 0  the switching cost regret for a seller is given
by:

Sc-RegretT(A; b1:T) = E"max

p⇤ ’ R(p⇤; bt)

T’t=1

R(pt; bt)# + cE[|{pt : pt   pt1}|] .

4.1 Reduction from Switching Cost Regret

As we stated above  our ﬁrst step is to show a reduction from switching cost regret for non-strategic
buyers. This we do in Theorem 3:
Theorem 3. For every (possibly randomized) seller A for strategic buyers with patience at most
ˆ⌧ = 1  there exists a randomized seller A0 for non-strategic buyers with patience ˆ⌧ = 0 such that:

1
2S 1
12

-RegretT(A0) RegretT(A)

The proof idea is to construct from every sequence of non-strategic buyers b1  . . .   bT a sequence of
strategic buyers ¯b1  . . .   ¯bT such that the regret incurred to A by ¯b1:T is at least the switching cost
regret incurred to A0 by b1:T . The idea behind the construction is as follows: At each iteration t we
choose with probability half to present to the seller bt and with probability half we present to the
seller a buyer zt that has the following statistics:

zt =⇢(v = 1

2 ⌧ = 0) w.p. 1
(v = 1 ⌧ = 1) w.p. 1

2
2

(4)

2 a buyer with value v = 1

2 and patience ⌧ = 0  and with probability 1
2 

That is  zt is with probability 1
zt is a buyer with value v = 1 and patience ⌧ = 1.
Observe that if zt would always have patience ⌧ = 0 (i.e.  even if her value is v = 1)  for any sequence
of prices the expected rewards from the zt buyer is always half  independent of the prices. In other
words  the sequence of noise does not change the performance of the sequence of prices and cannot
be exploited to improve. On the other hand  note since the value 1 corresponds to patience 1  the
seller might lose half whenever she reduces the price from 1 to 1
2. A crucial point is that the seller
must post her price in advance  therefore she cannot in any way predict if the buyer is willing to
wait or not and manipulate prices accordingly. A proof for the following Lemma is provided in the
supplementary material.
Lemma 4. Consider the pricing problem with ˆ⌧ = 1 and n = 2. Let b1  . . .   bT be a sequence of
buyers with patience 0. Let z1  . . .   zT be a sequence of stochastic buyers as in Eq. (4). Deﬁne ¯bt to
be a stochastic buyer that is with probability half bt and with probability half zt. Then  for any seller
A  the expected regret A incurs from the sequence ¯b1:T is at least

where the expectations are taken with respect to the internal randomization of the seller A and the

4.1.1 Proof for Theorem 3
To construct algortihm A0 from A  we develop a meta algorithm A  depicted in Algorithm 2 that
receives an algorithm  or seller  as input. A0 is then the seller obtained by ﬁxing A as the input for A.
In our reduction we assume that at each iteration algorithm A can ask from A one posted price pt 
and in turn she can return a feedback rt to algorithm A  then a new iteration begins.
The idea of construction is as follows: As an initialization step Algorithm A0 produces a stochastic
sequence of buyers of type z1  . . .   zt  the algorithm then chooses apriori if at step t a buyer ¯bt is
going to be the buyer bt that she observes or zt (with probability half each). The sequence ¯bt is
distributed as depicted in Lemma 4. Note that we do not assume that the learner knows the value of
bt.
At each iteration t  algorithm A0 receives price pt from algorithm A and posts price pt. She then
receives as feedback (pt; bt): Given the revenues (p1; b1)  . . .   (pt; bt) and her own internal
random variables  the algorithm can calculate the revenue for algorithm A w.r.t to the sequence of
buyers ¯b1  . . .   ¯bt  namely rt = R(pt1  . . .   pt+1  ¯b1:t).
In turn  at time t algorithm A0 returns to algorithm A her revenue  or feedback  w.r.t ¯b1  . . .   ¯bT at
time t which is rt.
Since Algorithm A receives as feedback at time t R(pt1  pt  pt+1; ¯b1:t)  we obtain that for the sequence
of posted prices p1  . . .   pT :

T’t=1

T’t=1

Taking expectation  using Lemma 4  and noting that the number of time pt+1 > pt is at least 1/3 of
the times pt   pt+1 (since there are only 2 prices)  we have that

(p⇤  p⇤; ¯bt)

RegretT(A; ¯b1:T) =

Since this is true for any sequence b1:T we obtain the desired result.

4.2 From MAB with switching cost to Pricing with switching cost
The above section concluded that switching cost for pricing may be reduced to pricing with strategic
buyers. Therefore  our next step would be to show that we can produce a sequence of non-strategic
buyers with high switching cost regret. Our proof relies on a further reduction for MAB with
Switching cost.
Theorem 5 (Dekel et al. [9]). Consider the MAB setting with 2 actions. For any randomized
: {1  2}!{ 0  1} such that
player  there exists a sequence of loss functions `1  . . .  ` T where `t
Sc-RegretT(A; `1:T)2 ⌦(T2/3)  for every c > 0.

7

Here we prove an analogous statement for pricing setting:
Theorem 6. Consider the pricing problem for buyers with patience ˆ⌧ = 0 and n = 2. For any
randomized seller  there exists a sequence of buyers b1  . . .   bT such that Sc-RegretT(A; b1:T)2
⌦(T2/3)  for every c > 0.
The transition from MAB with switching cost to pricing with switching cost is a non-trivial task. To
do so  we have to relate actions to prices and values to loss vectors in a manner that would relate the
revenue regret to the loss regret. The main challenge  perhaps  is that the structure of the feedback is
inherently different in the two problems. In two-armed bandit problems all loss conﬁguration are
feasible. In contrast  in the pricing case certain feedbacks collapse to full information: for example  if
we sell at price 1 we know the feedback from price 1
2 we obtain full
feedback for price 1.
Our reduction proceeds roughly along the following lines. We begin by constructing stochastic
mappings that turn loss vectors into values ⌫t : {0  1}2 !{ 0  1
2  1}. This in turn deﬁnes a mapping
from a sequences of losses `t to stochastic sequences of buyers bt. In our reduction we assume we
are given an algorithm A that solves the pricing problem; that is  at each iteration we may ask for
a price and then in turn we return a feedback (pt; bt). Note that we cannot assume that we have
access or know bt that is deﬁned by ⌫t(`t). The buyer bt depends on the full loss vector `t: assuming
that we can see the full `t would not lead to a meaningful reduction for MAB.
However  our construction of ⌫t is such that each posted price is associated with a single action. This
means that for each posted price there is a single action we need to observe in order to calculate the
correct feedback or revenue. This also means that we switch actions only when algorithm A switches
prices. Finally  our sequence of transformation has the following property: if i is the action needed in
order to discover the revenue for price p  then E(`t(i)) = 1
4 E((p; bt)). Thus  the regret for our
actions compares to the regret of the seller.

5 Discussion

In this work we introduced a new model of strategic buyers  where buyers have a window of time
in which they would like to purchase the item. Our modeling circumvents complicated dynamics
between the buyers  since it forces the seller to post prices for the entire window of time in advance.
We consider an adversarial setting  where both buyer valuation and window size are selected adver-
sarially. We compare our online algorithm to a static ﬁxed price  which is by deﬁnition oblivious
to the window sizes. We show that the regret is sub-linear  and more precisely ⇥(T2/3). The upper
bound shows that in this model the average regret per buyer is still vanishing. The lower bound shows
that having a window size greater than 1 impacts the regret bounds dramatically. Even for window
sizes 1 or 2 and prices 1
2 or 1 we get a regret of ⌦(T2/3)  compared to a regret of O(T1/2) when all
the windows are of size 1.
Given the sharp ⇥(T2/3) bound  it might be worth revisiting our feedback model. Our model assumes
that the feedback for the seller is the revenue obtained at the end of each day. It is worthwhile to
consider stronger feedback models  where the seller can gain more information about the buyers.
Namely  their day of arrival and their window size. In terms of the upper bound  our result applies to
any feedback model that is stronger  i.e.  as long as the seller gets to observe the revenue per day 
the O(T2/3) bound holds. As far as the lower bound is concerned  one can observe that our proofs
and construction are valid even for very strong feedback models. Namely  even if the seller gets as
feedback the revenue from buyer t at time t (instead of the time of purchase)  and in fact even if she
gets to observe the patience of the buyers (i.e. full information w.r.t. patience)  the ⌦(T2/3) bound
holds  as long as the seller posts prices in advance.
We did not consider continuous pricing explicitly  but one can verify that applying our algorithm to a
setting of continuous pricing gives a regret bound of O(T3/4)  by discretizing the continuous prices
to T1/4 prices. On the positive side  it shows that we still obtain a vanishing average regret in the
continuous case. On the other hand  we were not able to improve our lower bound to match this upper
bound. This gap is one of the interesting open problems in our work.
