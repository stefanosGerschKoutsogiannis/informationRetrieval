Abstract

Being able to predict the course of arbitrary chemical reactions is essential to the
theory and applications of organic chemistry. Previous approaches are not high-
throughput  are not generalizable or scalable  or lack sufﬁcient data to be effective.
We describe single mechanistic reactions as concerted electron movements from
an electron orbital source to an electron orbital sink. We use an existing rule-based
expert system to derive a dataset consisting of 2 989 productive mechanistic steps
and 6.14 million non-productive mechanistic steps. We then pose identifying pro-
ductive mechanistic steps as a ranking problem: rank potential orbital interactions
such that the top ranked interactions yield the major products. The machine learn-
ing implementation follows a two-stage approach  in which we ﬁrst train atom
level reactivity ﬁlters to prune 94.0% of non-productive reactions with less than a
0.1% false negative rate. Then  we train an ensemble of ranking models on pairs of
interacting orbitals to learn a relative productivity function over single mechanis-
tic reactions in a given system. Without the use of explicit transformation patterns 
the ensemble perfectly ranks the productive mechanisms at the top 89.1% of the
time  rising to 99.9% of the time when top ranked lists with at most four non-
productive reactions are considered. The ﬁnal system allows multi-step reaction
prediction. Furthermore  it is generalizable  making reasonable predictions over
reactants and conditions which the rule-based expert system does not handle.

1 Introduction

Determining the major products of chemical reactions given the input reactants and conditions is
a fundamental problem in organic chemistry. Reaction prediction is a necessary component of
retro-synthetic analysis or virtual library generation for drug design[1  2] and has the potential to
increase our understanding of biochemical catalysis and metabolism[3]. There are a broad range
of approaches to reaction prediction falling around at least three main poles: physical simulations
of transition states using various quantum mechanical and other approximations[4  5  6]  rule-based
expert systems[2  7  8  9  10  11]  and inductive machine learning methods[12]. However  none of
these approaches can successfully emulate the remarkable abilities of a human chemist.

1.1 Previous approaches and representations

The very concept of a “reaction” can be ambiguous  as it corresponds to a macroscopic abstraction 
hence simpliﬁcation  of a very complex underlying microscopic reality  ultimately driven by the

∗To whom correspondence should be addressed

laws of quantum and statistical mechanics. However  even for relatively small systems  it is impos-
sible to ﬁnd exact solutions to the Schr¨odinger equation. Thus in practice  energies are calculated
with varyingly accurate approximations  ranging from ab-initio Hartree-Fock approaches or density
functional theory to semi-empirical methods or mechanical force ﬁelds[6]. This leads to modeling
reactions as minimum energy paths between stable atom conﬁgurations on a high-dimensional po-
tential energy surface  where the path through the lowest energy transition state  i.e.  saddle point  is
the most favorable[4  5]. By explicitly modeling energies  these approaches can be highly accurate
and generalize to a diverse range of chemistries but require careful initialization and are computa-
tionally expensive (see [13] for a representative example). This branch of computational chemistry
provides invaluable tools for in-depth analysis but is currently not suitable for high-throughput re-
activity tasks and is far from being able to recapitulate the knowledge and ability of human experts.

In contrast  most rule-based expert systems for high-throughput reactivity tasks use a much more
abstract representation  in the form of general transformations over molecular graphs[2  7  8  9  10].
Reactions are predicted when a match is found in a library of allowable graph transformations. These
general transformations model only net molecular changes for processes that in reality involve a
sequence of transition states  as shown in Figure 1. These rule-based approaches suffer from at least
four drawbacks: (1) they use a representation that is too high-level  in that an overall transformation
obfuscates the underlying physical reality; (2) they require the manual curation of large amounts of
expert knowledge; (3) they become unmanageable at larger scales  in that adding a new graph pattern
often involves having to update a large proportion of existing transformations with exceptions; and
(4) they lack generality  in that particular chemistries must explicitly be encoded to be predicted.

Figure 1: Overall transformation of an alkene (hydrocarbon with double bond) with hydro-
bromic acid (HBr) and corresponding mechanistic reactions. (a) shows the overall transform as
a SMIRKS[14] string pattern and as a graph representation. In a molecular graph  vertices represent
atoms  with carbons at unlabeled vertices. The number of edges between two vertices represents
bond order. +/− symbols represent formal charge. Standard valences are ﬁlled using implicit
hydrogens. (b) shows the two mechanistic reactions composing the overall transformation as arrow-
pushing diagrams[15  16]. Dots represent non-bonded (lone pair) electrons  while arrows represent
concerted electron movement. In the ﬁrst step  electrons in the electron-rich carbon-carbon double
bond attack the hydrogen and break the electron-poor hydrogen-bromine single bond  producing an
anionic bromide (Br−) and a carbocation (C+). In the second step  electrons from the charged 
electron-rich bromide attack the electron-poor carbocation  yielding the ﬁnal alkyl halide.

Somewhere between low-level QM treatment and abstract graph-based overall transformations  one
can consider reactions at the mechanistic level. A mechanistic  or elementary  reaction is a con-
certed electron movement through a single transition state[15  16]. These mechanistic reactions can
be composed to yield overall transformations. For example  Figure 1 shows the overall transfor-
mation of an alkene interacting with hydrobromic acid to yield an alkyl halide  along with the two
elementary reactions which compose the transformation. A mechanistic reaction is described as an
idealized molecular orbital (MO) interaction between an electron source (donor) MO and an electron
sink (acceptor) MO. MOs represent regions of the molecule with high (source) or low (sink) electron

2

density. In general  potential electron sources are composed of lone pairs of electrons and bonds  and
potential electron sinks are composed of empty atomic orbitals and bonds. Bonds can act as either
a source or a sink depending on the context. Because of space constraints  we cannot fully describe
subtle chemical details that must be handled  such as chaining for resonance rearrangement. For
details  see texts[15  16] on mechanisms. Note that by considering all possible pairings of source
and sink MOs  this representation allows the exhaustive enumeration of all potential mechanistic
reactions over an arbitrary set of molecules.

Recent work by Chen and Baldi[11] introduces a rule-based expert system (Reaction Explorer) in
which each rearrangement pattern encompasses an elementary reaction. Here  the elementary reac-
tions represent “productive” mechanistic steps  i.e. those reactions which lead to the overall major
products. Thus  elementary reactions which are not the most kinetically favorable  but which even-
tually lead to the overall thermodynamic transformation product may be considered “productive”.
This approach is a marked change from previous approaches using overall transformations  but as a
rule-based system still suffers from the problems of curation  scale  and generality.

While mechanistic reaction representations are approximations quite far from the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion  we expect them to be closer to the underlying reality and therefore more useful than overall
transformations. Furthermore  we expect them also to be easier to predict than overall transfor-
mations due to their more elementary nature and mechanistic interpretation. In combination  these
arguments suggest that working with mechanistic steps may facilitate the application of statistical
machine learning approaches  and take advantage of their capability to generalize. Thus  in this
work  reactions are modeled as mechanisms  and for the remainder of the paper  we consider the
term “reaction” to denote a single elementary reaction. Furthermore  we consider the problem of
reaction prediction to be precisely that of identifying the “productive” reactions over a given set of
reactants under particular conditions.

There has been very little work on machine learning approaches to reaction prediction. The sole
example is a paper from 1990 on inductively extracting overall transformation patterns from reac-
tion databases[12]  a method which was never actually incorporated into a full reaction prediction
system. This situation is surprising. Given improvements in both computing power and machine
learning methods over the past 20 years  one could imagine a machine learning system that mines
reaction information to learn the grammar of chemistry  e.g.  in terms of graph grammars[17]. One
potential reason behind the lack of progress in this area is the paucity of available data. Chemical
publishing is dominated by closed models  making literature information difﬁcult to access. Further-
more  parsing scientiﬁc text and extracting relevant chemical information from text and image data
is an open problem of research[18  19]. While commercial reaction databases exist  e.g.  Reaxys[20]
or SPRESI[21]  the reactions in these databases are mostly unbalanced  not atom-mapped  and lack
mechanistic detail[22]. This is in addition to suffering from a severe lack of openness; the databases
are exorbitantly priced or provided with a restrictive query interface which precludes serious statisti-
cal data mining. As a result  and to the best of our knowledge  effective machine learning approaches
to reaction prediction still need to be developed.

1.2 A new approach

The limitations of previous work motivate a new  fresh approach to reaction prediction combining
machine learning with mechanistic representations. The key idea is to ﬁrst enumerate all potential
source and sink MOs  and thus all possible reactions by their pairing  and then use classiﬁcation
and ranking techniques to identify productive reactions. There are multiple beneﬁts resulting from
such an approach. By using very general rules to enumerate possible reactions  the approach is not
restricted to manually curated reaction patterns. By detailing individual reactions at the mechanistic
level  the system may be able to statistically learn efﬁcient predictive models based on physico-
chemical attributes rather than abstract overall transformations. And by ranking possible reactions
instead of making binary decisions  the system may provide results amenable to ﬂexible interpreta-
tion. However  the new approach also faces three key challenges: (1) the development of appropri-
ate training datasets of productive reactions; (2) the development of a machine learning approach to
control the combinatorial complexity resulting from considering all possible pairs of electron donors
and acceptors among the reacting molecules; and (3) the development of machine learning solutions
to the problem of predictively ranking the possible mechanisms. These challenges are addressed
one-by-one in the following sections.

3

2 The data challenge

A mechanistically deﬁned dataset of reactions to use with the proposed approach does not currently
exist. To derive a dataset  we use a mechanistically deﬁned rule-based expert system (Reaction
Explorer) together with its validation suite[11]. The validation suite is a manually composed set of
reactants  reagents  and products covering a complete undergraduate organic chemistry curriculum.

Entering a set of reactants and a reagent model into Reaction Explorer yields the complete sequence
of mechanistic steps leading to the ﬁnal products  where all reactions in this sequence share the
conditions encoded by the corresponding reagent model. Each one of these mechanistic steps is
considered to be a distinct productive elementary reaction. For a given set of reactants and condi-
tions  which we call a (r  c) query tuple  the Reaction Explorer system labels a small set of reactions
productive  while all other reactions enumerated by pairing source and sink MOs over the reactants
are considered non-productive.

We then deﬁne two {0  1} labels for each atom (up to symmetries) and conditions (a  c) tuple over
all (r  c) queries. An (a  c) tuple has label srcreact = 1 if it is the main atom of a source MO in
a productive reaction over any corresponding (r  c) query  and has label srcreact = 0 otherwise.
The label sinkreact is deﬁned similarly using sink MOs.

Reaction conditions are described with three parameters: temperature  anion solvation potential 
and cation solvation potential. Temperature is listed in Kelvin. The solvation potentials are unitless
numbers between 0 and 1 representing ease of cation or anion solvation  thus providing a quantita-
tive scale to describe polar protic  polar aprotic  and nonpolar solvents. Note that any mechanistic
interaction with the solvent or reagent is explicitly modeled  e.g. as in Figure 1.

As an initial validation of the method  we consider general ionic reactions from the Reaction Ex-
plorer validation suite involving C  H  N  O  Li  Mg  and the halides. Extensions to include stere-
oselective  pericyclic  and radical reactions are discussed in Section 5. The dataset consists of 6.14
million reactions composed of 84 825 source and 74 725 sink MOs from 2 752 distinct reactants
and reaction conditions  i.e.  (r  c) queries. Of these 6.14 million reactions  the Reaction Explorer
system labels 2 989 of them as productive. There are 22 894 atom symmetry classes  which when
paired with reaction condition yields 29 104 (a  c) tuples. Of these 29 104 (a  c) tuples  1 262 have
label srcreact = 1   and 1 786 have label sinkreact = 1.
Atom and MO interaction data is available at our chemoinformatics portal (http://cdb.ics.
uci.edu) under Supplements.

3 The combinatorial complexity challenge

In the dataset  the average molecule has 44 source MOs and 50 sink MOs. For this average molecule 
considering only intermolecular reactions with a second copy of the same molecule gives 44 ×
50 = 2200 potential elementary reactions. Thus  the number of possible reactions is very large 
motivating identifying productive reactions given a (r  c) query in two stages. In the ﬁrst stage  we
train ﬁlters using classiﬁcation techniques on the source and sink reactivity labels. The idea is to
train highly sensitive classiﬁers which reduce the breadth of possible reactions without erroneously
ﬁltering productive reactions. Then only those source and sink MOs where the main atom passes
the respective atom level ﬁlter are considered when enumerating reactions to consider in the second
ranking stage for predicting reaction productivity.

Here  we train two separate classiﬁers to predict the source and sink atom level reactivity labels 
each using the same feature descriptions and machine learning implementations. To assess the
performance of the reactive site ﬁlter training  we perform full 10-fold cross-validation (CV) over
all distinct tuples of molecules and conditions (m  c).

3.1 Feature representation

Each (a  c) tuple is represented as a vector of physicochemical and topological features. There are
14 real-valued physicochemical features such as the reaction conditions  the molecular weight of
the molecule  and the charge at and around the atom. Topological features are meant to capture the
neighboring context of a in the molecular graph  for example counts over vertex-and-edge labeled

4

paths and trees rooted at a. We compute paths to length 4 and trees to depth 2  producing 743
molecular graph features. In addition to standard molecular graph features  we also include similar
topological features over a restricted alphabet pharmacophore point graph  where pharmacophore
point graph deﬁnitions are adapted from H¨ahnke  et al[23]. Using paths of length 4 and trees of
depth 2 in the pharmacophore point graph yields another 759 features. This results in a total of
1 516 features.

3.2 Training

Before training  all features are normalized to [0  1] using the minimum and maximum values of
the training set. We oversample (a  c) tuples with label 1 to ensure approximately balanced classes.
We experimented with a variety of architectures. Here we report the results obtained using artiﬁcial
neural networks using sigmoidal activation functions  with a single hidden layer and a single output
node with a cross-entropy error function. Grid search using internal three-fold CV on a single train-
ing set is used to ﬁt the architecture size (converging to 10 hidden nodes) and the L2-regularization
(weight decay) parameter shared by all folds of the overall 10-fold CV. Weights are optimized by
stochastic gradient descent with per-weight adaptive learning rates[24]. Optimization is stopped
after 100 epochs as this is observed to be sufﬁcient for convergence.
As highly sensitive classiﬁers are desired  the choice of a decision threshold is important. We per-
form internal three-fold CV on the training set to ﬁnd decision thresholds yielding a false negative
rate of 0 on each respective internal test set. The decision threshold for the overall CV fold is taken
as the average of these internal CV fold thresholds.

3.3 Results

We report the true negative rate (TNR) and the false negative rate (FNR) for both the source and
sink classiﬁcation problems as well as for the the actual reaction ﬁltering problem  as shown in
Table 1. In a CV regime  we are able to ﬁlter 94.0% of the 6.14 million non-productive reactions
with less than 0.1% false negatives  effectively reducing the ranking problem imbalance by an order
of magnitude with minimal error. Having established excellent ﬁltering results with rigorous CV 
we then train classiﬁers with all available data in order to independently assess the ranking method.
The results of these classiﬁers are shown in the last column of Table 1.

Table 1: Reactive site classiﬁcation results. Source reactive and sink reactive rows show results
on the respective classiﬁcation problems. The reaction row shows results of using the two atom
classiﬁers for an initial reaction ﬁltering. CV columns indicate results of full 10-fold cross-validation
over (m  c) tuples. CV results show the mean and standard deviation over folds. The best TNR
column shows results when trained with all available data.

4 The ranking challenge

We pose the task of identifying the productive reactions as a ranking problem. To assess perfor-
mance  we perform full 10-fold CV over the 2 752 distinct (r  c) queries. With the overall ﬁltered
set of reactions  there are  on average  1.1 productive and 62.5 non-productive reactions per (r  c)
query.

4.1 Feature representation

Each reaction is composed of a source and sink MO. The reaction feature vector is the concatenation
of the corresponding source and sink atom level feature vectors with some modiﬁcations. To keep
the size reasonable  only real valued and pharmacophore (path length 3 and tree depth 2) atom level

5

features are included. 124 features are calculated to describe the net difference between reactants
and products  such as counts over bond types  rings  and formal charges. And ﬁnally  450 features
describing the forward and inverse reactions are calculated  including atoms and bonds involved and
implied transition state geometry. This leads to a total of 1 677 reaction features.

4.2 Training

We use a pairwise approach to ranking similar to [25]  using two identical shared-weight artiﬁcial
neural networks linked to a single comparator output node with ﬁxed ±1 weights. The general
architecture is shown in Figure 2. Each shared network receives as an input a potential reaction  i.e.
a source-sink pair. Training is performed via back-propagation with weight-sharing.

...

(Source  Sink) A

(Source  Sink) B

Figure 2: Shared weight artiﬁcial neural network architecture for pairwise ranking. The goal is
to determine a productivity order between the (source  sink) A and (source  sink) B pairs. This
is done with a pair of shared-weight artiﬁcial neural networks with sigmoidal hidden nodes and a
linear output node. The output of these internal networks are tied to a single sigmoidal output node
with ﬁxed weights. The ﬁnal output will approach 1 if the (source  sink) A pair is predicted to be
relatively more productive than the (source  sink) B pair  and 0 otherwise.

Training details are similar to the reactive site classiﬁcation. All features are normalized to [0  1]
and grid search with internal three-fold CV on a single training set is used to ﬁt the architecture
size (converging to 20 hidden nodes) and L2-regularization (weight decay) parameter shared by all
folds of the overall 10-fold CV. Weights are optimized using stochastic gradient descent with the
same per-weight adaptive learning rate scheme[24]. Optimization is stopped after 25 epochs as this
is observed to be sufﬁcient for convergence.

An ensemble consisting of ﬁve separate pairwise ranking machines (as described in Figure 2) is used
for each training set. Each machine in the ensemble is trained with all the productive reactions (from
the training set) and a random partition of the non-productive reactions (from the training set). Final
ranking on the test set is determined by either simple majority vote or by ranking the average scores
from the linear output node of the inner shared-weight network for each machine in the ensemble.
The latter yields a minute performance increase and is reported.

4.3 Results

We consider two measures for evaluating rankings  Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at list
size i (NDCG@i) and Percent Within-n. NDCG@i is a common information retrieval metric[26]
that sums the overall usefulness (or gain) of productive reactions in a given list of the top-i results 
where individual gain decays exponentially with lower position. The measure is normalized such
that the best possible ranking of a size i list has NDCG@i = 1. For example  NDCG@1 is the
fraction of (r  c) queries in which the top ranked reaction is a productive reaction. Percent Within-n
is simply how many (r  c) queries have at most n non-productive reactions in the smallest ranked list
containing all productive reactions. For example  Percent Within-0 measures the percent of (r  c)

6

queries with perfect rank  and Percent Within-4 measures how often all productive reactions are
recovered with at most 4 mis-ranked non-productive reactions. Note that the NDCG@1 and Percent
Within-0 will differ because roughly 10% of (r  c) queries have more than one productive reaction.
The non-productive MO interactions vastly outnumber the productive interactions. In spite of this
imbalance  our approach gives excellent ranking results  shown in Table 2. The NDCG results
show  for example  that in 89.5% of the queries  the top ranked reaction is productive. The Percent
Within-n results show that 89.1% of queries have perfect ranking  while 99.9% of queries recover
all productive reactions by considering lists with at most four non-productive reactions.

list sizes i (NDCG@i) and Percent Within-n. See text for description of the measures. We report

4.4 Chemical applications

The strong performance of the ranking system is exhibited by its ability to make accurate multi-step
reaction predictions. An example  shown in the ﬁrst row of Table 3  is an intramolecular Claisen
condensation reaction with conditions (room temperature  polar aprotic solvent) requiring three el-
ementary steps. The ranking method correctly predicts the given reaction as the highest ranked
reaction at each step.

Table 3: Chemical reactions of interest. The ﬁrst row shows an example of full multi-step reaction
prediction by the ranking system  a three step intramolecular Claisen condensation (room temp. 
polar aprotic). At each stage  the reaction shown is the top ranked when all possible reactions are
considered by the two stage machine learning system. The second row shows two macrocyclizations
which the rule-based system (Reaction Explorer) is unable to predict  but the machine learning
approach effectively generalizes and ranks correctly. These reactions lead to the formation of a
seven homo-cycle (7 carbons) on the left and seven hetero-cycle (6 carbons  1 oxygen) on the right.
The third row shows an intelligible error of the machine learning approach (see text).

Step

Errors

A generalizable system should be able to make reasonable predictions about reactants and reaction
types with which it has only had implicit  rather than explicit  experience. Reaction Explorer  as a

7

rule-based expert system without explicit rules about larger ring forming reactions  does not make
any predictions about seven and eight atom cyclizations.
In reality though  larger ring forming
reactions are possible. The second row of Table 3 shows the top two ranked reactions over a set
of bromo-hept-1-en-2-olate reactants  leading to seven-member ring formation. The ranking model 
without ever being trained with seven or eight-member ring forming reactions  returns the enolate
attack as the most favorable  but also returns the lone pair nucleophilic substitution as the second
most favorable. Similar results are made for similar eight-membered ring systems (not shown).
Thus the ranking model is able to generalize and make reasonable suggestions  while the rule-based
system is limited by hard-coded transformation patterns.

Finally  the vast majority of errors are close errors  as exhibited by the 99.9% Within-4 measure.
Furthermore  upon examination of these errors  they are largely intelligible and not unreasonable
predictions. For example  the third row of Table 3 shows two reactions involving an oxonium com-
pound and a bromide anion. Our ranking models return these two reactions as the highest  ranking
the deprotonation slightly ahead of the substitution. This is considered a Within-1 ranking because
the Reaction Explorer system labels only the substitution reaction as productive. However  the
immediate precursor reaction in the sequence of Reaction Explorer mechanisms leading to these
reactants is the inverse of the deprotonation reaction  i.e.  the protonation of the alcohol. Hydrogen
transfer reactions like this are reversible  and thus the deprotonation is likely the kinetically favored
mechanism  i.e.  it is reasonable to rank the deprotonation highly. It is just not productive  in that it
does not lead to the ﬁnal overall product. In a prediction system working with multi-step syntheses 
such reversals of previous steps are easily discarded.

5 Conclusion

Being able to predict the outcome of chemical reactions is a fundamental scientiﬁc problem. The
ultimate goal of a reaction prediction system is to recapitulate and eventually surpass the ability of
human chemists. In this work  we take a signiﬁcant step in this direction  showing how to formulate
reaction prediction as a machine learning problem and building an accurate implementation for a
large and key subset of organic chemistry. There are a number of immediate applications of our
system  including validating retro-synthetic suggestions  generating virtual libraries of molecules 
and mechanistically annotating existing reaction databases.

Reaction prediction is a largely untapped area for machine learning approaches. As such  there is of
course room for improvements. The ﬁrst is increasing the breadth of chemistry captured  e.g. radical 
pericyclic  and stereoselective chemistry. Augmenting the MO description with number of electrons 
allowing cyclic chained MO interactions  and including face orientations are plausible extensions to
attack each of these additional areas of chemical reactivity. A second area of improvement is the
curation of larger mechanistically deﬁned datasets. We can approach this manually  by further use
of expert systems to construct data with the required level of detail  or by carefully crafted crowd-
sourcing approaches. Other ongoing areas of research include improving the features  performing
systematic feature selection  and experimenting with different statistical ranking techniques.

As an untapped research problem for the machine learning community  we hope that the current
work and our publicly available data will spark continued and open research in this important area.
