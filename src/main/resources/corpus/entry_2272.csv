Abstract

Consider a convex relaxation ˆf of a pseudo-boolean function f. We say that
the relaxation is totally half-integral if ˆf (x) is a polyhedral function with half-
integral extreme points x  and this property is preserved after adding an arbitrary
combination of constraints of the form xi = xj  xi = 1 − xj  and xi = γ where
γ ∈ {0  1  1
2} is a constant. A well-known example is the roof duality relaxation
for quadratic pseudo-boolean functions f. We argue that total half-integrality is a
natural requirement for generalizations of roof duality to arbitrary pseudo-boolean
functions.
Our contributions are as follows. First  we provide a complete characterization
of totally half-integral relaxations ˆf by establishing a one-to-one correspondence
with bisubmodular functions. Second  we give a new characterization of bisub-
modular functions. Finally  we show some relationships between general totally
half-integral relaxations and relaxations based on the roof duality.

Introduction

1
Let V be a set of |V | = n nodes and B ⊂ K1/2 ⊂ K be the following sets:

B = {0  1}V

K1/2 = {0  1

2   1}V

K = [0  1]V

A function f : B → R is called pseudo-boolean. In this paper we consider convex relaxations
ˆf : K → R of f which we call totally half-integral:
Deﬁnition 1. (a) Function ˆf : P → R where P ⊆ K is called half-integral if it is a convex
polyhedral function such that all extreme points of the epigraph {(x  z) | x ∈ P  z ≥ ˆf (x)} have
the form (x  ˆf (x)) where x ∈ K1/2. (b) Function ˆf : K → R is called totally half-integral if
restrictions ˆf : P → R are half-integral for all subsets P ⊆ K obtained from K by adding an
arbitrary combination of constraints of the form xi = xj  xi = xj  and xi = γ for points x ∈ K.
Here i  j denote nodes in V   γ denotes a constant in {0  1  1

2}  and z ≡ 1 − z.

pseudo-boolean functions f (x) = (cid:80)

i cixi +(cid:80)

A well-known example of a totally half-integral relaxation is the roof duality relaxation for quadratic
(i j) cijxixj studied by Hammer  Hansen and
It is known to possess the persistency property: for any half-integral minimizer
Simeone [13].
ˆx ∈ arg min ˆf (ˆx) there exists minimizer x ∈ arg min f (x) such that xi = ˆxi for all nodes i with
integral component ˆxi. This property is quite important in practice as it allows to reduce the size
of the minimization problem when ˆx (cid:54)= 1
2. The set of nodes with guaranteed optimal solution can
sometimes be increased further using the PROBE technique [6]  which also relies on persistency.
The goal of this paper is to generalize the roof duality approach to arbitrary pseudo-boolean func-
tions. The total half-integrality is a very natural requirement of such generalizations  as discussed
later in this section. As we prove  total half-integrality implies persistency.

We provide a complete characterization of totally half-integral relaxations. Namely  we prove in sec-
tion 2 that if ˆf : K → R is totally half-integral then its restriction to K1/2 is a bisubmodular function 
and conversely any bisubmodular function can be extended to a totally half-integral relaxation.
Deﬁnition 2. Function f : K1/2 → R is called bisubmodular if

f (x (cid:117) y) + f (x (cid:116) y) ≤ f (x) + f (y)

∀ x  y ∈ K1/2

where binary operators (cid:117) (cid:116) : K1/2 × K1/2 → K1/2 are deﬁned component-wise as follows:

As our second contribution  we give a new characterization of bisubmodular functions (section 3).
Using this characterization  we then prove several results showing links with the roof duality relax-
ation (section 4).

1.1 Applications

objective function of the form f (x) =(cid:80)

This work has been motivated by computer vision applications. A fundamental task in vision is
to infer pixel properties from observed data. These properties can be the type of object to which
the pixel belongs  distance to the camera  pixel intensity before being corrupted by noise  etc. The
popular MAP-MRF approach casts the inference task as an energy minimization problem with the
C fC(x) where C ⊂ V are subsets of neighboring pixels
of small cardinality (|C| = 1  2  3  . . .) and terms fC(x) depend only on labels of pixels in C.
For some vision applications the roof duality approach [13] has shown a good performance [30 
32  23  24  33  1  16  17].1 Functions with higher-order terms are steadily gaining popularity in
computer vision [31  33  1  16  17]; it is generally accepted that they correspond to better image
models. Therefore  studying generalizations of roof duality to arbitrary pseudo-boolean functions
is an important task. In such generalizations the total half-integrality property is essential. Indeed 
in practice  the relaxation ˆf is obtained as the sum of relaxations ˆfC constructed for each term
independently. Some of these terms can be c|xi − xj| and c|xi + xj − 1|.
If c is sufﬁciently
large  then applying the roof duality relaxation to these terms would yield constraints xi = xj and
x = xj present in the deﬁnition of total half-integrality. Constraints xi = γ ∈ {0  1  1
2} can also
be simulated via the roof duality  e.g. xi = xj  xi = xj for the same pair of nodes i  j implies
2.
xi = xj = 1

1.2 Related work

Half-integrality There is a vast literature on using half-integral relaxations for various combina-
torial optimization problems. In many cases these relaxations lead to 2-approximation algorithms.
Below we list a few representative papers.
The earliest work recognizing half-integrality of polytopes with certain pairwise constraints was
perhaps by Balinksi [3]  while the persistency property goes back to Nemhauser and Trotter [28]
who considered the vertex cover problem. Hammer  Hansen and Simeone [13] established that these
properties hold for the roof duality relaxation for quadratic pseudo-boolean functions. Their work
was generalized to arbitrary pseudo-boolean functions by Lu and Williams [25]. (The relaxation
in [25] relied on converting function f to a multinomial representation; see section 4 for more
details.) Hochbaum [14  15] gave a class of integer problems with half-integral relaxations. Very
recently  Iwata and Nagano [18] formulated a half-integral relaxation for the problem of minimizing
submodular function f (x) under constraints of the form xi + xj ≥ 1.

1In many vision problems variables xi are not binary. However  such problems are often reduced to
a sequence of binary minimization problems using iterative move-making algorithms  e.g. using expansion
moves [9] or fusion moves [23  24  33  17].

(cid:80) fC(x)  convert terms fC(x) to quadratic pseudo-boolean functions by introducing auxiliary

In computer vision  several researchers considered the following scheme: given a function f (x) =

binary variables  and then apply the roof duality relaxation to the latter. Woodford et al. [33] used
this technique for the stereo reconstruction problem  while Ali et al. [1] and Ishikawa [16] explored
different conversions to quadratic functions.
To the best of our knowledge  all examples of totally half-integral relaxations proposed so far belong
to the class of submodular relaxations  which is deﬁned in section 4. They form a subclass of more
general bisubmodular relaxations.
Bisubmodularity Bisubmodular functions were introduced by Chandrasekaran and Kabadi as rank
functions of (poly-)pseudomatroids [10  19]. Independently  Bouchet [7] introduced the concept of
∆-matroids which is equivalent to pseudomatroids. Bisubmodular functions and their generaliza-
tions have also been considered by Qi [29]  Nakamura [27]  Bouchet and Cunningham [8] and Fu-
jishige [11]. The notion of the Lov´asz extension of a bisubmodular function introduced by Qi [29]
will be of particular importance for our work (see next section).
It has been shown that some submodular minimization algorithms can be generalized to bisubmod-
ular functions. Qi [29] showed the applicability of the ellipsoid method. A weakly polynomial com-
binatorial algorithm for minimizing bisubmodular functions was given by Fujishige and Iwata [12] 
and a strongly polynomial version was given by McCormick and Fujishige [26].
Recently  we introduced strongly and weakly tree-submodular functions [22] that generalize bisub-
modular functions.

2 Total half-integrality and bisubmodularity

The ﬁrst result of this paper is following theorem.
Theorem 3. If ˆf : K → R is a totally half-integral relaxation then its restriction to K1/2 is bisub-
modular. Conversely  if function f : K1/2 → R is bisubmodular then it has a unique totally half-
integral extension ˆf : K → R.
This section is devoted to the proof of theorem 3. Denote L = [−1  1]V   L1/2 = {−1  0  1}V . It
will be convenient to work with functions ˆh : L → R and h : L1/2 → R obtained from ˆf and f via
a linear change of coordinates xi (cid:55)→ 2xi − 1. Under this change totally half-integral relaxations are
transformed to totally integral relaxations:
Deﬁnition 4. Let ˆh : L → R be a function of n variables. (a) ˆh is called integral if it is a convex
polyhedral function such that all extreme points of the epigraph {(x  z)| x ∈ L  z ≥ ˆh(x)} have the
form (x  ˆh(x)) where x ∈ L1/2. (b) ˆh is called totally integral if it is integral and for an arbitrary
ordering of nodes the following functions of n − 1 variables (if n > 1) are totally integral:

ˆh(cid:48)(x1  . . .   xn−1) = ˆh(x1  . . .   xn−1  xn−1)
ˆh(cid:48)(x1  . . .   xn−1) = ˆh(x1  . . .   xn−1 −xn−1)
ˆh(cid:48)(x1  . . .   xn−1) = ˆh(x1  . . .   xn−1  γ)

for any constant γ ∈ {−1  0  1}

The deﬁnition of a bisubmodular function is adapted as follows: function h : L1/2 → R is bisub-
modular if inequality (1) holds for all x  y ∈ L1/2 where operations (cid:117) (cid:116) are deﬁned by tables (2)
after replacements 0 (cid:55)→ −1  1
2 (cid:55)→ 0  1 (cid:55)→ 1. To prove theorem 3  it sufﬁces to establish a link
between totally integral relaxations ˆh : L → R and bisubmodular functions h : L1/2 → R. We can
assume without loss of generality that ˆh(0) = h(0) = 0  since adding a constant to the functions
does not affect the theorem.
A pair ω = (π  σ) where π : V → {1  . . .   n} is a permutation of V and σ ∈ {−1  1}V will be
called a signed ordering. Let us rename nodes in V so that π(i) = i. To each signed ordering ω we
associate labelings x0  x1  . . .   xn ∈ L1/2 as follows:
x1 = (σ1  0  . . .   0)

xn = (σ1  σ2  . . .   σn)

Consider function h : L1/2 → R with h(0) = 0. Its Lov´asz extension ˆh : RV → R is deﬁned in
the following way [29]. Given a vector x ∈ RV   select a signed ordering ω = (π  σ) as follows:
(i) choose π so that values |xi|  i ∈ V are non-increasing  and rename nodes accordingly so that
|x1| ≥ . . . ≥ |xn|; (ii) if xi (cid:54)= 0 set σi = sign(xi)  otherwise choose σi ∈ {−1  1} arbitrarily. It
is not difﬁcult to check that

Theorem 5 ([29]). Function h is bisubmodular if and only if its Lov´asz extension ˆh is convex on
L. 2
Let Lω be the set of vectors in L for which signed ordering ω = (π  σ) can be selected. Clearly 
Lω = {x ∈ L | |x1| ≥ . . . ≥ |xn|  xiσi ≥ 0 ∀i ∈ V }. It is easy to check that Lω is the convex hull
of n + 1 points (3). Equations (4) imply that ˆh is linear on Lω and coincides with h in each corner
x0  . . .   xn.
Lemma 6. Suppose function ˜h : L → R is totally integral. Then ˜h is linear on simplex Lω for each
signed ordering ω = (π  σ).
Proof. We use induction on n = |V |. For n = 1 the claim is straightforward; suppose that n ≥ 2.
Consider signed ordering ω = (π  σ). We need to prove that ˜h is linear on the boundary ∂Lω; this
will imply that ˆg is linear on Lω since otherwise ˜h would have an extreme point in the the interior
Lω\∂Lω which cannot be integral.
Let X = {x0  . . .   xn} be the set of extreme points of Lω deﬁned by (3). The boundary ∂Lω is the
union of n + 1 facets L0
ω is the convex hull of points in X\{xi}. Let us prove
ω = {x ∈ Lω | x1 =
that ˜h is linear on L0
σ1}. Consider function of n − 1 variables ˜h(cid:48)(x2  . . .   xn) = ˜h(σ1  x2  . . .   xn)  and let L(cid:48) 0
ω be the
projection of L0
ω   and thus ˜h is linear on
L0
ω.
The fact that ˜h is linear on other facets can be proved in a similar way. Note that for i = 2  . . .   n− 1
there holds Li
ω = {x ∈ Lω | xn = 0}.

ω = {x ∈ Lω | xi = σi−1σixi−1}  and for i = n we have Ln

Corollary 7. Suppose function ˜h : L → R with ˜h(0) = 0 is totally integral. Let h be the restriction
of ˜h to L1/2 and ˆh be the Lov´asz extension of h. Then ˜h and ˆh coincide on L.

Theorem 5 and corollary 7 imply the ﬁrst part of theorem 3. The second part will follow from
Lemma 8. If h : L1/2 → R with h(0) = 0 is bisubmodular then its Lov´asz extension ˆh : L → R is
totally integral.

2Note  Qi formulates this result slightly differently: ˆh is assumed to be convex on RV rather than on L.
However  it is easy to see that convexity of ˆh on L implies convexity of ˆh on RV . Indeed  it can be checked
that ˆh is positively homogeneous  i.e. ˆh(γx) = γˆh(x) for any γ ≥ 0  x ∈ RV . Therefore  for any x  y ∈ RV
and α  β ≥ 0 with α + β = 1 there holds

ˆh(γy) = αˆh(x) + βˆh(y)

where the inequality in the middle follows from convexity of ˆh on L  assuming that γ is a sufﬁciently small
constant.

Proof. We use induction on n = |V |. For n = 1 the claim is straightforward; suppose that n ≥ 2.
By theorem 5  ˆh is convex on L. Function ˆh is integral since it is linear on each simplex Lω and
vertices of Lω belong to L1/2. It remains to show that functions ˆh(cid:48) considered in deﬁnition 4 are
totally integral. Consider the following functions h(cid:48) : {−1  0  1}V \{n} → R:

h(cid:48)(x1  . . .   xn−1) = h(x1  . . .   xn−1  xn−1)
h(cid:48)(x1  . . .   xn−1) = h(x1  . . .   xn−1 −xn−1)
h(cid:48)(x1  . . .   xn−1) = h(x1  . . .   xn−1  γ)   γ ∈ {−1  0  1}

It can be checked that these functions are bisubmodular  and their Lov´asz extensions coincide with
respective functions ˆh(cid:48) used in deﬁnition 4. The claim now follows from the induction hypothesis.

3 A new characterization of bisubmodularity

In this section we give an alternative deﬁnition of bisubmodularity; it will be helpful later for de-
scribing a relationship to the roof duality. As is often done for bisubmodular functions  we will
encode each half-integral value xi ∈ {0  1  1
2} via two binary variables (ui  ui(cid:48)) according to the
following rules:
1 ↔ (1  0)
Thus  labelings in K1/2 will be represented via labelings in the set

2 ↔ (0  0)

0 ↔ (0  1)

1

X − = {u ∈ {0  1}V | (ui  ui(cid:48)) (cid:54)= (1  1) ∀ i ∈ V }

where V = {i  i(cid:48) | i ∈ V } is a set with 2n nodes. The node i(cid:48) for i ∈ V is called the “mate” of
i; intuitively  variable ui(cid:48) corresponds to the complement of ui. We deﬁne (i(cid:48))(cid:48) = i for i ∈ V .
Labelings in X − will be denoted either by a single letter  e.g. u or v  or by a pair of letters  e.g.
(x  y). In the latter case we assume that the two components correspond to labelings of V and
V \V   respectively  and the order of variables in both components match. Using this convention  the
one-to-one mapping X − → K1/2 can be written as (x  y) (cid:55)→ 1
2 (x + y). Accordingly  instead of
function f : K1/2 → R we will work with the function g : X − → R deﬁned by

(cid:18) x + y

(cid:19)

2

(5)
Note that the set of integer labelings B ⊂ K1/2 corresponds to the set X ◦ = {u ∈ X − | (ui  ui(cid:48)) (cid:54)=
(0  0)}  so function g : X − → R can be viewed as a discrete relaxation of function g : X ◦ → R.
Deﬁnition 9. Function f : X − → R is called bisubmodular if

g(x  y) = f

f (u (cid:117) v) + f (u (cid:116) v) ≤ f (u) + f (v)

(6)
where u (cid:117) v = u ∧ v  u (cid:116) v = REDUCE(u ∨ v) and REDUCE(w) is the labeling obtained from
w by changing labels (wi  wi(cid:48)) from (1  1) to (0  0) for all i ∈ V .
To describe a new characterization  we need to introduce some additional notation. We denote
X = {0  1}V to be the set of all binary labelings of V . For a labeling u ∈ X   deﬁne labeling u(cid:48) by
(u(cid:48))i = ui(cid:48). Labels (ui  ui(cid:48)) are transformed according to the rules

∀ u  v ∈ X −

(0  1) → (0  1)

(1  0) → (1  0)

(7)
Equivalently  this mapping can be written as (x  y)(cid:48) = (y  x). Note that u(cid:48)(cid:48) = u  (u∧ v)(cid:48) = u(cid:48)∨ v(cid:48)
and (u ∨ v)(cid:48) = u(cid:48) ∧ v(cid:48) for u  v ∈ X . Next  we deﬁne sets

(0  0) → (1  1)

(1  1) → (0  0)

X − = {u ∈ X | u ≤ u(cid:48)} = {u ∈ X | (ui  u(cid:48)
X + = {u ∈ X | u ≥ u(cid:48)} = {u ∈ X | (ui  u(cid:48)
X ◦ = {u ∈ X | u = u(cid:48)} = {u ∈ X | (ui  u(cid:48)
X (cid:63) = X − ∪ X +

i) (cid:54)= (1  1) ∀i ∈ V }
i) (cid:54)= (0  0) ∀i ∈ V }
i) ∈ {(0  1)  (1  0)} ∀i ∈ V } = X − ∩ X +

Clearly  u ∈ X − if and only if u(cid:48) ∈ X +. Also  any function g : X − → R can be uniquely extended
to a function g : X (cid:63) → R so that the following condition holds:
∀ u ∈ X (cid:63)

g(u(cid:48)) = g(u)

(8)

5

Proposition 10. Let g : X (cid:63) → R be a function satisfying (8). The following conditions are equiva-
lent:

(a) g is bisubmodular  i.e. it satisﬁes (6).

(b) g satisﬁes the following inequalities:

g(u ∧ v) + g(u ∨ v) ≤ g(u) + g(v)

(9)
(c) g satisﬁes those inequalities in (6) for which u = w ∨ ei  v = w ∨ ej where w = u ∧ v
and i  j are distinct nodes in V with wi = wj = 0. Here ek for node k ∈ V denotes the
labeling in X with ek

k(cid:48) = 0 for k(cid:48) ∈ V \{k}.

k = 1 and ek

if u  v  u ∧ v  u ∨ v ∈ X (cid:63)

(d) g satisﬁes those inequalities in (9) for which u = w ∨ ei  v = w ∨ ej where w = u ∧ v

and i  j are distinct nodes in V with zi = zj = 0.

A proof is given [20]. Note  an equivalent of characterization (c) was given by Ando et al. [2]; we
state it here for completeness.
Remark 1 In order to compare characterizations (b d) to existing characterizations (a c)  we need
to analyze the sets of inequalities in (b d) modulo eq. (8)  i.e. after replacing terms g(w)  w ∈ X +
with g(w(cid:48)). In can be seen that the inequalities in (a) are neither subset nor superset of those in (b)3 
so (b) is a new characterization. It is also possible to show that from this point of view (c) and (d)
are equivalent.

4 Submodular relaxations and roof duality
Consider a submodular function g : X → R satisfying the following “symmetry” condition:

g(u(cid:48)) = g(u)

∀ u ∈ X

(10)
We call such function g a submodular relaxation of function f (x) = g(x  x). Clearly  it satisﬁes
conditions of proposition 10  so g is also a bisubmodular relaxation of f. Furthermore  minimizing
g is equivalent to minimizing its restriction g : X − → R; indeed  if u ∈ X is a minimizer of g then
so are u(cid:48) and u ∧ u(cid:48) ∈ X −.
In this section we will do the following: (i) prove that any pseudo-boolean function f : B → R has
a submodular relaxation g : X → R; (ii) show that the roof duality relaxation for quadratic pseudo-
boolean functions is a submodular relaxation  and it dominates all other bisubmodular relaxations;
(iii) show that for non-quadratic pseudo-boolean functions bisubmodular relaxations can be tighter
than submodular ones; (iv) prove that similar to the roof duality relaxation  bisubmodular relaxations
possess the persistency property.

showed their equivalence. One of these formulations was called a roof dual. An efﬁcient maxﬂow-
based method for solving the roof duality relaxation was given by Hammer  Boros and Sun [5  4].
We will rely on this algorithmic description of the roof duality approach [4]. The method’s idea
can be summarized as follows. Each variable xi is replaced with two binary variables ui and ui(cid:48)
corresponding to xi and 1 − xi respectively. The new set of nodes is V = {i  i(cid:48) | i ∈ V }. Next 
function f is transformed to a function g : X → R by replacing each term according to the following
rules:

fi(xi)

fij(xi  xj)

fij(xi  xj)

(cid:55)→ 1
2
(cid:55)→ 1

(cid:55)→ 1

[fi(ui) + fi(ui(cid:48))]

[fij(ui  uj) + fij(ui(cid:48)  uj(cid:48))]

[fij(ui  uj(cid:48)) + fij(ui(cid:48)  uj)]

if fij(· ·) is not submodular

2 (ui + ui(cid:48)) [4].

g is a submodular quadratic pseudo-boolean function  so it can be minimized via a maxﬂow al-
gorithm. If u ∈ X is a minimizer of g then the roof duality relaxation has a minimizer ˆx with
ˆxi = 1
It is easy to check that g(u) = g(u(cid:48)) for all u ∈ X   therefore g is a submodular relaxation. Also  f
and g are equivalent when ui(cid:48) = ui for all i ∈ V   i.e.
g(x  x) = f (x)

∀x ∈ B

(13)

Invariance to variable ﬂipping Suppose that g is a (bi-)submodular relaxation of function f :
B → R. Let i be a ﬁxed node in V   and consider function f(cid:48)(x) obtained from f (x) by a change of
coordinates xi (cid:55)→ xi and function g(cid:48)(u) obtained from g(u) by swapping variables ui and ui(cid:48). It is
easy to check that g(cid:48) is a (bi-)submodular relaxation of f(cid:48). Furthermore  if f is a quadratic pseudo-
boolean function and g is its submodular relaxation constructed by the roof duality approach  then
applying the roof duality approach to f(cid:48) yields function g(cid:48). We will sometimes use such “ﬂipping”
operation for reducing the number of considered cases.
Conversion to roof duality Let us now consider a non-quadratic pseudo-boolean function f : B →
R. Several papers [33  1  16] proposed the following scheme: (1) Convert f to a quadratic pseudo-
boolean function ˜f by introducing k auxiliary binary variables so that f (x) = minα∈{0 1}k ˜f (x  α)
for all labelings x ∈ B. (2) Construct submodular relaxation ˜g(x  α  y  β) of ˜f by applying the roof
duality relaxation to ˜f; then

˜g(x  α  y  β) = ˜g(y  β  x  α)  

˜g(x  α  x  α) = ˜f (x  α)

∀x  y ∈ B  α  β ∈ {0  1}k
variables:

g(x  y)

(3) Obtain
g
minα β∈{0 1}k ˜g(x  α  y  β).
One can check that g(x  y) = g(y  x)  so g is a submodular relaxation4.
In general  however 
it may not be a relaxation of function f  i.e. (13) may not hold; we are only guaranteed to have
g(x  x) ≤ f (x) for all labelings x ∈ B.
It is easy to check that if f : B → R is submodular
Existence of submodular relaxations
2 [f (x) + f (y)] is a submodular relaxation of f.5 Thus  monomials of
then function g(x  y) = 1
the form cΠi∈Axi where c ≤ 0 and A ⊆ V have submodular relaxations. Using the “ﬂipping”
operation xi (cid:55)→ xi  we conclude that submodular relaxations also exist for monomials of the form
4It is well-known that minimizing variables out preserves submodularity. Indeed  suppose that h(x) =

minα ˜h(x  α) where ˜h is a submodular function. Then h is also submodular since

h(x) + h(y) = ˜h(x  α) + ˜h(y  β) ≥ ˜h(x ∧ y  α ∧ β) + ˜h(x ∨ y  α ∨ β) ≥ h(x ∧ y) + h(x ∨ y)

5In fact  it dominates all other bisubmodular relaxations ¯g : X − → R of f. Indeed  consider labeling
(x  y) ∈ X −. It can be checked that (x  y) = u (cid:117) v = u (cid:116) v where u = (x  x) and v = (y  y)  therefore
¯g(x  y) ≤ 1

2 [f (x) + f (y)] = g(x  y).

2 [¯g(u) + ¯g(v)] = 1

cΠi∈AxiΠi∈Bxi where c ≤ 0 and A  B are disjoint subsets of U. It is known that any pseudo-
boolean function f can be represented as a sum of such monomials (see e.g. [4]; we need to represent
−f as a posiform and take its negative). This implies that any pseudo-boolean function f has a
submodular relaxation.
Note that this argument is due to Lu and Williams [25] who converted function f to a sum of
monomials of the form cΠi∈Axi and cxkΠi∈Axi  c ≤ 0  k /∈ A. It is possible to show that the
relaxation proposed in [25] is equivalent to the submodular relaxation constructed by the scheme
above (we omit the derivation).
Submodular vs. bisubmodular relaxations An important question is whether bisubmodular
relaxations are more “powerful” compared to submodular ones. The next theorem gives a class of
functions for which the answer is negative; its proof is given in [20].
Theorem 11. Let g be the submodular relaxation of a quadratic pseudo-boolean function f deﬁned
by (12)  and assume that the set E does not have parallel edges. Then g dominates any other
bisubmodular relaxation ¯g of f  i.e. g(u) ≥ ¯g(u) for all u ∈ X −.
For non-quadratic pseudo-boolean functions  however  the situation can be different. In [20]. we
give an example of a function f of n = 4 variables which has a tight bisubmodular relaxation g (i.e.
g has a minimizer in X ◦)  but all submodular relaxations are not tight.
Persistency Finally  we show that bisubmodular functions possess the autarky property  which
implies persistency.
Proposition 12. Let f : K1/2 → R be a bisubmodular function and x ∈ K1/2 be its minimizer.
[Autarky] Let y be a labeling in B. Consider labeling z = (y (cid:116) x) (cid:116) x. Then z ∈ B and
f (z) ≤ f (y).
[Persistency] Function f : B → R has a minimizer x∗ ∈ B such that x∗
with integral xi.

i = xi for nodes i ∈ V

2 and zi = xi if xi ∈ {0  1}. Thus  z ∈ B. For
Proof. It can be checked that zi = yi if xi = 1
any w ∈ K1/2 there holds f (w (cid:116) x) ≤ f (w) + [f (x) − f (w (cid:117) x)] ≤ f (w). This implies that
f ((y (cid:116) x) (cid:116) x) ≤ f (y). Applying the autarky property to a labeling y ∈ arg min{f (x) | x ∈ B }
yields persistency.

5 Conclusions and future work

by computer vision applications that use functions of the form f (x) =(cid:80)

We showed that bisubmodular functions can be viewed as a natural generalization of the roof duality
approach to higher-order cliques. As mentioned in the introduction  this work has been motivated
C fC(x). An important
open question is how to construct bisubmodular relaxations ˆfC for individual terms. For terms of
low order  e.g. with |C| = 3  this potentially could be done by solving a small linear program.
Another important question is how to minimize such functions. Algorithms in [12  26] are unlikely
to be practical for most vision problems  which typically have tens of thousands of variables. How-
ever  in our case we need to minimize a bisubmodular function which has a special structure: it
is represented as a sum of low-order bisubmodular terms. We recently showed [21] that a sum of
low-order submodular terms can be optimized more efﬁciently using maxﬂow-like techniques. We
conjecture that similar techniques can be developed for bisubmodular functions as well.
