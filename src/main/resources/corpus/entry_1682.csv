Abstract

Many popular network models rely on the assumption of (vertex) exchangeability 
in which the distribution of the graph is invariant to relabelings of the vertices.
However  the Aldous-Hoover theorem guarantees that these graphs are dense or
empty with probability one  whereas many real-world graphs are sparse. We
present an alternative notion of exchangeability for random graphs  which we call
edge exchangeability  in which the distribution of a graph sequence is invariant
to the order of the edges. We demonstrate that edge-exchangeable models  unlike
models that are traditionally vertex exchangeable  can exhibit sparsity. To do
so  we outline a general framework for graph generative models; by contrast to
the pioneering work of Caron and Fox [12]  models within our framework are
stationary across steps of the graph sequence. In particular  our model grows the
graph by instantiating more latent atoms of a single random measure as the dataset
size increases  rather than adding new atoms to the measure.

Introduction

In recent years  network data have appeared in a growing number of applications  such as online
social networks  biological networks  and networks representing communication patterns. As a result 
there is growing interest in developing models for such data and studying their properties. Crucially 
individual network data sets also continue to increase in size; we typically assume that the number of
vertices is unbounded as time progresses. We say a graph sequence is dense if the number of edges
grows quadratically in the number of vertices  and a graph sequence is sparse if the number of edges
grows sub-quadratically as a function of the number of vertices. Sparse graph sequences are more
representative of real-world graph behavior. However  many popular network models (see  e.g.  Lloyd
et al. [19] for an extensive list) share the undesirable scaling property that they yield dense sequences
of graphs with probability one. The poor scaling properties of these models can be traced back to a
seemingly innocent assumption: that the vertices in the model are exchangeable  that is  any ﬁnite
permutation of the rows and columns of the graph adjacency matrix does not change the distribution
of the graph. Under this assumption  the Aldous-Hoover theorem [1  16] implies that such models
generate dense or empty graphs with probability one [20].
This fundamental model misspeciﬁcation motivates the development of new models that can achieve
sparsity. One recent focus has been on models in which an additional parameter is employed to
uniformly decrease the probabilities of edges as the network grows (e.g.  Bollobás et al. [3]  Borgs
et al. [4  5]  Wolfe and Olhede [24]). While these models allow sparse graph sequences  the sequences
are no longer projective. In projective sequences  vertices and edges are added to a graph as a
graph sequence progresses—whereas in the models above  there is not generally any strict subgraph
relationship between earlier graphs and later graphs in the sequence. Projectivity is natural in
streaming modeling. For instance  we may wish to capture new users joining a social network and
new connections being made among existing users—or new employees joining a company and new
communications between existing employees.

Caron and Fox [12] have pioneered initial work on sparse  projective graph sequences. Instead of
the vertex exchangeability that yields the Aldous-Hoover theorem  they consider a notion of graph
exchangeability based on the idea of independent increments of subordinators [18]  explored in depth
by Veitch and Roy [22]. However  since this Kallenberg-style exchangeability introduces a new
countable inﬁnity of latent vertices at every step in the graph sequence  its generative mechanism
seems particularly suited to the non-stationary domain. By contrast  we are here interested in exploring
stationary models that grow in complexity with the size of the data set. Consider classic Bayesian
nonparametric models as the Chinese restaurant process (CRP) and Indian buffet process (IBP); these
engender growth by using a single inﬁnite latent collection of parameters to generate a ﬁnite but
growing set of instantiated parameters. Similarly  we propose a framework that uses a single inﬁnite
latent collection of vertices to generate a ﬁnite but growing set of vertices that participate in edges
and thereby in the network. We believe our framework will be a useful component in more complex 
non-stationary graphical models—just as the CRP and IBP are often combined with hidden Markov
models or other explicit non-stationary mechanisms. Additionally  Kallenberg exchangeability is
intimately tied to continuous-valued labels of the vertices  and here we are interested in providing a
characterization of the graph sequence based solely on its topology.
In this work  we introduce a new form of exchangeability  distinct from both vertex exchangeability
and Kallenberg exchangeability. In particular  we say that a graph sequence is edge exchangeable if
the distribution of any graph in the sequence is invariant to the order in which edges arrive—rather
than the order of the vertices. We will demonstrate that edge exchangeability admits a large family of
sparse  projective graph sequences.
In the remainder of the paper  we start by deﬁning dense and sparse graph sequences rigorously.
We review vertex exchangeability before introducing our new notion of edge exchangeability in
Section 2  which we also contrast with Kallenberg exchangeability in more detail in Section 4. We
deﬁne a family of models  which we call graph frequency models  based on random measures in
Section 3. We use these models to show that edge-exchangeable models can yield sparse  projective
graph sequences via theoretical analysis in Section 5 and via simulations in Section 6. Along the way 
we highlight other beneﬁts of the edge exchangeability and graph frequency model frameworks.

2 Exchangeability in graphs: old and new

Let (Gn)n := G1  G2  . . . be a sequence of graphs  where each graph Gn = (Vn  En) consists of a
(ﬁnite) set of vertices Vn and a (ﬁnite) multiset of edges En. Each edge e ∈ En is a set of two vertices
in Vn. We assume the sequence is projective—or growing—so that Vn ⊆ Vn+1 and En ⊆ En+1.
Consider  e.g.  a social network with more users joining the network and making new connections
with existing users. We say that a graph sequence is dense if |En| = Ω(|Vn|2)  i.e.  the number of
edges is asymptotically lower bounded by c · |Vn|2 for some constant c. Conversely  a sequence is
sparse if |En| = o(|Vn|2)  i.e.  the number of edges is asymptotically upper bounded by c · |Vn|2
for all constants c. In what follows  we consider random graph sequences  and we focus on the case
where |Vn| → ∞ almost surely.

2.1 Vertex-exchangeable graph sequences

If the number of vertices in the graph sequence grows to inﬁnity  the graphs in the sequence can
be thought of as subgraphs of an “inﬁnite” graph with inﬁnitely many vertices and a correspond-
ingly inﬁnite adjacency matrix. Traditionally  exchangeability in random graphs is deﬁned as the
invariance of the distribution of any ﬁnite submatrix of this adjacency matrix—corresponding to any
ﬁnite collection of vertices—under ﬁnite permutation. Equivalently  we can express this form of
exchangeability  which we henceforth call vertex exchangeability  by considering a random sequence
of graphs (Gn)n with Vn = [n]  where [n] := {1  . . .   n}. In this case  only the edge sequence is
random. Let π be any permutation of the integers [n]. If e = {v  w}  let π(e) := {π(v)  π(w)}. If
En = {e1  . . .   em}  let π(En) := {π(e1)  . . .   π(em)}.
Deﬁnition 2.1. Consider the random graph sequence (Gn)n  where Gn has vertices Vn = [n] and
edges En. (Gn)n is (inﬁnitely) vertex exchangeable if for every n ∈ N and for every permutation π
of the vertices [n]  Gn

d
= ˜Gn  where ˜Gn has vertices [n] and edges π(En).

A great many popular models for graphs are vertex exchangeable; see Appendix B and Lloyd
et al. [19] for a list. However  it follows from the Aldous-Hoover theorem [1  16] that any vertex-
exchangeable graph is a mixture of sampling procedures from graphons. Further  any graph sampled
from a graphon is almost surely dense or empty [20]. Thus  vertex-exchangeable random graph
models are misspeciﬁed models for sparse network datasets  as they generate dense graphs.

2.2 Edge-exchangeable graph sequences

Vertex-exchangeable sequences have distributions invariant to the order of vertex arrival. We introduce
edge-exchangeable graph sequences  which will instead be invariant to the order of edge arrival.
As before  we let Gn = (Vn  En) be the nth graph in the sequence. Here  though  we consider
only active vertices—that is  vertices that are connected via some edge. That lets us deﬁne Vn as a
function of En; namely  Vn is the union of the vertices in En. Note that a graph that has sub-quadratic
growth in the number of edges as a function of the number of active vertices will necessarily have
sub-quadratic growth in the number of edges as a function of the number of all vertices  so we obtain
strictly stronger results by considering active vertices. In this case  the graph Gn is completely
deﬁned by its edge set En.
As above  we suppose that En ⊆ En+1. We can emphasize this projectivity property by augmenting
each edge with the step on which it is added to the sequence. Let E(cid:48)
n be a collection of tuples  in
which the ﬁrst element is the edge and the second element is the step (i.e.  index) on which the edge
n = {(e1  s1)  . . .   (em  sm)}. We can then deﬁne a step-augmented graph sequence
is added: E(cid:48)
(E(cid:48)
n)n = (E(cid:48)
1  E(cid:48)
2  . . .) as a sequence of step-augmented edge sets. Note that there is a bijection
between the step-augmented graph sequence and the original graph sequence.
Example 2.2. In the setup for vertex exchangeability  we assumed Vn = [n] and every edge is
introduced as soon as both of its vertices are introduced. In this case  the step of any edge in the
step-augmented graph is the maximum vertex value. For example  in Figure 1  we have

1 = ∅  E(cid:48)
E(cid:48)

2 = E(cid:48)

3 = {({1  2}  2)}  E(cid:48)

4 = {({1  2}  2)  ({1  4}  4)  ({2  4}  4)  ({3  4}  4)}.

In general step-augmented graphs  though  the step need not equal the max vertex  as we see next. (cid:4)
Example 2.3. Suppose we have a graph given by the edge sequence (see Figure 1):

E1 = E2 = {{2  5} {5  5}}  E3 = E2 ∪ {{2  5}}  E4 = E3 ∪ {{1  6}}.

The step-augmented graph E(cid:48)

4 is {({2  5}  1)  ({5  5}  1)  ({2  5}  3)  ({1  6}  4)}.

(cid:4)

Roughly  a random graph sequence is edge exchangeable if its distribution is invariant to ﬁnite
permutations of the steps. Let π be a permutation of the integers [n]. For a step-augmented edge set
n = {(e1  s1)  . . .   (em  sm)}  let π(E(cid:48)
E(cid:48)
Deﬁnition 2.4. Consider the random graph sequence (Gn)n  where Gn has step-augmented edges
n and Vn are the active vertices of En. (Gn)n is (inﬁnitely) edge exchangeable if for every n ∈ N
E(cid:48)

n) = {(e1  π(s1))  . . .   (em  π(sm))}.

and for every permutation π of the steps [n]  Gn
and associated active vertices.

d

= ˜Gn  where ˜Gn has step-augmented edges π(E(cid:48)
n)

See Figure 1 for visualizations of both vertex exchangeability and edge exchangeability. It remains
to show that there are non-trivial models that are edge exchangeable (Section 3) and that edge-
exchangeable models admit sparse graphs (Section 5).

3 Graph frequency models

We next demonstrate that a wide class of models  which we call graph frequency models  exhibit edge
exchangeability. Consider a latent inﬁnity of vertices indexed by the positive integers N = {1  2  . . .} 
along with an inﬁnity of edge labels (θ{i j})  each in a set Θ  and positive edge rates (or frequencies)
(w{i j}) in R+. We allow both the (θ{i j}) and (w{i j}) to be random  though this is not mandatory.
For instance  we might choose θ{i j} = (i  j) for i ≤ j  and Θ = R2. Alternatively  the θ{i j}
could be drawn iid from a continuous distribution such as Unif[0  1]. For any choice of (θ{i j}) and
(w{i j}) 

(cid:88)

{i j}:i j∈N

W :=

w{i j}δθ{i j}

(1)

is a measure on Θ. Moreover  it is a discrete measure since it is always atomic. If either (θ{i j}) or
(w{i j}) (or both) are random  W is a discrete random measure on Θ since it is a random  discrete-
measure-valued element. Given the edge rates (or frequencies) (w{i j}) in W   we next show some
natural ways to construct edge-exchangeable graphs.

If the rates (w{i j}) are normalized such that(cid:80){i j}:i j∈N w{i j} = 1  then

Single edge per step.
(w{i j}) is a distribution over all possible vertex pairs. In other words  W is a probability measure. We
can form an edge-exchangeable graph sequence by ﬁrst drawing values for (w{i j}) and (θ{i j})—and
setting E0 = ∅. We recursively set En+1 = En ∪ {e}  where e is an edge {i  j} chosen from the
distribution (w{i j}). This construction introduces a single edge in the graph each step  although it
may be a duplicate of an edge that already exists. Therefore  this technique generates multigraphs
one edge at a time. Since the edge every step is drawn conditionally iid given W   we have an
edge-exchangeable graph.

Multiple edges per step. Alternatively  the rates (w{i j}) may not be normalized. Then W may
not be a probability measure. Let f (m|w) be a distribution over non-negative integers m given some
rate w ∈ R+. We again initialize our sequence by drawing (w{i j}) and (θ{i j}) and setting E0 = ∅.
In this case  recursively  on the nth step  start by setting F = ∅. For every possible edge e = {i  j} 
ind∼ f (·|we) and add me copies of edge e to
we draw the multiplicity of the edge e in this step as me
F . Finally  En+1 = En ∪ F . This technique potentially introduces multiple edges in each step  in
which edges themselves may have multiplicity greater than one and may be duplicates of edges that
already exist in the graph. Therefore  this technique generates multigraphs  multiple edges at a time.
If we restrict f and W such that ﬁnitely many edges are added on every step almost surely  we have
an edge-exchangeable graph  as the edges in each step are drawn conditionally iid given W .
Given a sequence of edge sets E0  E1  . . . constructed via either of the above methods  we can
form a binary graph sequence ¯E0  ¯E1  . . . by setting ¯Ei to have the same edges as Ei except with
multiplicity 1. Although this binary graph is not itself edge exchangeable  it inherits many of the
properties (such as sparsity  as shown in Section 5) of the underlying edge-exchangeable multigraph.
The choice of the distribution on the measure W has a strong inﬂuence on the properties of the
resulting edge-exchangeable graph sampled via one of the above methods. For example  one choice is
to set w{i j} = wiwj  where the (wi)i are a countable inﬁnity of random values generated according
to a Poisson point process (PPP). We say that (wi)i is distributed according to a Poisson point process
parameterized by rate measure ν  (wi)i ∼ PPP(ν)  if (a) #{i : wi ∈ A} ∼ Poisson(ν(A)) for any
set A with ﬁnite measure ν(A) and (b) #{i : wi ∈ Aj} are independent random variables across any
ﬁnite collection of disjoint sets (Aj)J
j=1. In Section 5 we examine a particular example of this graph
frequency model  and demonstrate that sparsity is possible in edge-exchangeable graphs.

repeated on the right side). Each atom corresponds to a latent vertex. Each point (θi  θj) corresponds
to a latent edge. Darker point colors on the left occur for greater edge multiplicities. On the left  more
latent edges are instantiated as more steps n are taken. On the right  the edges within [0  y]2 are ﬁxed

Given a unique label θi for each vertex i ∈ N  and denoting gij = gji to be the number of undirected
edges between vertices i and j  the graph itself can be represented as the discrete random measure
+. A different notion of exchangeability for graphs than the ones in
+ is (jointly)

graph measure G = (cid:80)

This form of exchangeability  which we refer to as Kallenberg exchangeability  can intuitively be
viewed as invariance of the graph distribution to relabeling of the vertices  which are now embedded in
R2
+. As such it is analogous to vertex exchangeability  but for discrete random measures [12  Sec. 4.1].
Exchangeability for random measures was introduced by Aldous [2]  and a representation theorem
was given by Kallenberg [17  18  Ch. 9]. The use of Kallenberg exchangeability for modeling graphs
was ﬁrst proposed by Caron and Fox [12]  and then characterized in greater generality by Veitch and
Roy [22] and Borgs et al. [6]. Edge exchangeability is distinct from Kallenberg exchangeability  as
shown by the following example.
Example 4.1 (Edge exchangeable but not Kallenberg exchangeable). Consider the graph frequency
model developed in Section 3  with w{i j} = (ij)−2 and θ{i j} = {i  j}. Since the edges at each
step are drawn iid given W   the graph sequence is edge exchangeable. However  the corresponding
i j nijδ(i j) (where nij = nji ∼ Binom(N  (ij)−2)) is not Kallenberg
exchangeable  since the probability of generating edge {i  j} is directly related to the positions (i  j)
+ of the corresponding atoms in G (in particular  the probability is decreasing in ij). (cid:4)
and (j  i) in R2
Our graph frequency model is reminiscent of the Caron and Fox [12] generative model  but has a
number of key differences. At a high level  this earlier model generates a weight measure W =
i j wijδ(θi θj ) (Caron and Fox [12] used  in particular  the outer product of a completely random
measure)  and the graph measure G is constructed by sampling gij once given wij for each pair
i  j. To create a ﬁnite graph  the graph measure G is restricted to the subset [0  y] × [0  y] ⊂ R2
+ for
0 < y < ∞; to create a projective growing graph sequence  the value of y is increased. By contrast 
in the analogous graph frequency model of the present work  y is ﬁxed  and we grow the network

(cid:80)

by repeatedly sampling the number of edges gij between vertices i and j and summing the result.
Thus  in the Caron and Fox [12] model  a latent inﬁnity of vertices (only ﬁnitely many of which
are active) are added to the network each time y increases. In our graph frequency model  there is
a single collection of latent vertices  which are all gradually activated by increasing the number of
samples that generate edges between the vertices. See Figure 2 for an illustration.
Increasing n in the graph frequency model has the interpretation of both (a) time passing and (b) new
individuals joining a network because they have formed a connection that was not previously there. In
particular  only latent individuals that will eventually join the network are considered. This behavior
is analogous to the well-known behavior of other nonparametric Bayesian models such as  e.g.  a
Chinese restaurant process (CRP). In this analogy  the Dirichlet process (DP) corresponds to our
graph frequency model  and the clusters instantiated by the CRP correspond to the vertices that are
active after n steps. In the DP  only latent clusters that will eventually appear in the data are modeled.
Since the graph frequency setting is stationary like the DP/CRP  it may be more straightforward to
develop approximate Bayesian inference algorithms  e.g.  via truncation [11].
Edge exchangeability ﬁrst appeared in work by Crane and Dempsey [13  14]  Williamson [23]  and
Broderick and Cai [7  8]  Cai and Broderick [10]. Broderick and Cai [7  8] established the notion of
edge exchangeability used here and provided characterizations via exchangeable partitions and feature
allocations  as in Appendix C. Broderick and Cai [7]  Cai and Broderick [10] developed a frequency
model based on weights (wi)i generated from a Poisson process and studied several types of power
laws in the model. Crane and Dempsey [13] established a similar notion of edge exchangeability
in the context of a larger statistical modeling framework. Crane and Dempsey [13  14] provided
sparsity and power law results for the case where the weights (wi)i are generated from a Pitman-Yor
process and power law degree distribution simulations. Williamson [23] described a similar notion
of edge exchangeability and developed an edge-exchangeable model where the weights (wi)i are
generated from a Dirichlet process  a mixture model extension  and an efﬁcient Bayesian inference
procedure. In work concurrent to the present paper  Crane and Dempsey [15] re-examined edge
exchangeability  provided a representation theorem  and studied sparsity and power laws for the same
model based on Pitman-Yor weights. By contrast  we here obtain sparsity results across all Poisson
point process-based graph frequency models of the form in Equation (2) below  and use a speciﬁc
three-parameter beta process rate measure only for simulations in Section 6.

ν([0  1]) = ∞ and(cid:82) 1
inﬁnite collection of rates in [0  1] and that(cid:80)

We now demonstrate that  unlike vertex exchangeability  edge exchangeability allows for sparsity in
random graph sequences. We develop a class of sparse  edge-exchangeable multigraph sequences via
the Poisson point process construction introduced in Section 3  along with their binary restrictions.
Model. Let W be a Poisson process on [0  1] with a nonatomic  σ-ﬁnite rate measure ν satisfying
0 wν(dw) < ∞. These two conditions on ν guarantee that W is a countably
w∈W w < ∞ almost surely. We can use W to construct
the set of rates: w{i j} = wiwj if i (cid:54)= j  and w{i i} = 0. The edge labels θ{i j} are unimportant in
characterizing sparsity  and so can be ignored.
To use the multiple-edges-per-step graph frequency model from Section 3  we let f (·|w) be Bernoulli
with probability w. Since edge {i  j} is added in each step with probability wiwj  its multiplicity
M{i j} after n steps has a binomial distribution with parameters n  wiwj. Note that self-loops are
avoided by setting w{i i} = 0. Therefore  the graph after n steps is described by:

W ∼ PPP(ν)

M{i j} ind∼ Binom(n  wiwj) for i < j ∈ N.

En containing {i  j} with multiplicity M{i j}  and active vertices Vn = {i : (cid:80)

(2)
As mentioned earlier  this generative model yields an edge-exchangeable graph  with edge multiset
j M{i j} > 0}.
Although this model generates multigraphs  it can be modiﬁed to sample a binary graph ( ¯Vn  ¯En) by
setting ¯Vn = Vn and ¯En to the set of edges {i  j} such that {i  j} has multiplicity ≥ 1 in En. We
can express the number of vertices and edges  in the multi- and binary graphs respectively  as
| ¯Vn| =|Vn| =

1(cid:0)M{i j} > 0(cid:1) .

Moments. Recall that a sequence of graphs is considered sparse if |En| = o(|Vn|2). Thus  sparsity
in the present setting is an asymptotic property of a random graph sequence. Rather than consider the
asymptotics of the (dependent) random sequences |En| and |Vn| in concert  Lemma 5.1 allows us to
consider the asymptotics of their ﬁrst moments  which are deterministic sequences and can be analyzed
separately. We use ∼ to denote asymptotic equivalence  i.e.  an ∼ bn ⇐⇒ limn→∞ an
= 1. For
details on our asymptotic notation and proofs for this section  see Appendix D.

Theorem 5.3 implies that the multigraph is sparse when α ∈ (1/2  1)  and that the restriction to the
binary graph is sparse for any α ∈ (0  1). See Remark D.7 for a discussion. Thus  edge-exchangeable
random graph sequences allow for a wide range of sparse and dense behavior.

6 Simulations

In this section  we explore the behavior of graphs generated by the model from Section 5 via
simulation  with the primary goal of empirically demonstrating that the model produces sparse graphs.
We consider the case when the Poisson process generating the weights in Equation (2) has the rate
measure of a three-parameter beta process (3-BP) on (0  1) [9  21]:

ν(dw) = γ

with mass γ > 0  concentration β > 0  and discount α ∈ (0  1). In order for the 3-BP to have
j wj < ∞  we require that β > −α. We draw realizations of the weights from a
3-BP(γ  β  α) according to the stick-breaking representation given by Broderick  Jordan  and Pitman

Since simulating an inﬁnite number of atoms is not possible  we truncate the outer summation in i to
i=1 Ci weights. The parameters of the beta process were ﬁxed to γ = 3
and θ = 1  as they do not inﬂuence the sparsity of the resulting graph frequency model  and we varied

the discount parameter α. Given a single draw W (at some speciﬁc discount α)  we then simulated
the edges of the graph  where the number of Bernoulli draws N varied between 50 and 2000.
Figure 3a shows how the number of edges varies versus the total number of active vertices for
the multigraph  with different colors representing different random seeds. To check whether the
generated graph was sparse  we determined the exponent by examining the slope of the data points
(on a log-scale). In all plots  the black dashed line is a line with slope 2. In the multigraph  we found
that for the discount parameter settings α = 0.6  0.7  the slopes were below 2; for α = 0  0.3  the
slopes were greater than 2. This corresponds to our theoretical results; for α < 0.5 the multigraph
is dense with slope greater than 2  and for α > 0.5 the multigraph is sparse with slope less than 2.
Furthermore  the sparse graphs exhibit power law relationships between the number of edges and
vertices  i.e.  |EN| a.s.∼ c|VN|b  N → ∞  where b ∈ (1  2)  as suggested by the linear relationship in
the plots between the quantities on a log-scale. Note that there are necessarily fewer edges in the
binary graph than in the multigraph  and thus this plot implies that the binary graph frequency model
can also capture sparsity. Figure 3b conﬁrms this observation; it shows how the number of edges
varies with the number of active vertices for the binary graph. In this case  across α ∈ (0  1)  we
observe slopes that are less than 2. This agrees with our theory from Section 5  which states that the
binary graph is sparse for any α ∈ (0  1).

7 Conclusions

We have proposed an alternative form of exchangeability for random graphs  which we call edge
exchangeability  in which the distribution of a graph sequence is invariant to the order of the edges. We
have demonstrated that edge-exchangeable graph sequences  unlike traditional vertex-exchangeable
sequences  can be sparse by developing a class of edge-exchangeable graph frequency models that
provably exhibit sparsity. Simulations using edge frequencies drawn according to a three-parameter
beta process conﬁrm our theoretical results regarding sparsity. Our results suggest that a variety of
future directions would be fruitful—including theoretically characterizing different types of power
laws within graph frequency models  characterizing the use of truncation within graph frequency
models as a means for approximate Bayesian inference in graphs  and understanding the full range of
distributions over sparse  edge-exchangeable graph sequences.
