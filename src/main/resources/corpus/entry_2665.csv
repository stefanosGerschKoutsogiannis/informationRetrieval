Abstract

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables measuring human brain
activity  in vivo. Yet  the fMRI hemodynamic response unfolds over very slow
timescales (<0.1-1 Hz)  orders of magnitude slower than millisecond timescales of
neural spiking. It is unclear  therefore  if slow dynamics as measured with fMRI
are relevant for cognitive function. We investigated this question with a novel
application of Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA) and machine learning to
fMRI data. We analyzed slowly sampled (1.4 Hz) fMRI data from 1000 healthy
human participants (Human Connectome Project database)  and applied GPFA to
reduce dimensionality and extract smooth latent dynamics. GPFA dimensions with
slow (<1 Hz) characteristic timescales identiﬁed  with high accuracy (>95%)  the
speciﬁc task that each subject was performing inside the fMRI scanner. Moreover 
functional connectivity between slow GPFA latents accurately predicted inter-
individual differences in behavioral scores across a range of cognitive tasks. Finally 
infra-slow (<0.1 Hz) latent dynamics predicted CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating)
scores of individual patients  and identiﬁed patients with mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) who would progress to develop Alzheimer’s dementia (AD). Slow and
infra-slow brain dynamics may be relevant for understanding the neural basis of
cognitive function  in health and disease.

Introduction

1
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is among the few techniques that enable non-invasive
measurement of activity in the living human brain (in vivo) [1]. Although state-of-the-art fMRI scans
can measure activity at high (sub-millimeter) spatial resolution  the fMRI blood-oxygenation level
dependent (BOLD) hemodynamic response occurs over very slow timescales of several seconds (~0.1
Hz)  and is typically sampled at a rate of around 1 Hz or less [2] – orders of magnitude slower than
the millisecond timescales of underlying neural activity (>100 Hz). Moreover  fMRI measurements
are noisy: sources of noise include scanner noise  head movement artifacts and physiological artifacts
that systematically confound the fMRI signal [3]. Thus  fMRI BOLD activity reﬂects an indirect 
noisy measure of neural activity  mismatched to neural timescales by several orders of magnitude.
Previous studies have linked the BOLD response to underlying neurophysiological signals at various

timescales [4–6]  and have shown that fMRI data can be used to directly measure slow (<1 Hz) and
infra-slow (<0.1 Hz) ﬂuctuations in brain activity [7–10].
Here  we examined whether slow and infra-slow dynamics  as measured with slowly sampled fMRI
data  are relevant for cognitive function  employing a novel combination of denoising  dimensionality
reduction and machine learning. We applied Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA) – a recent
technique for concurrent smoothing and dimensionality reduction of noisy data [11] – to fMRI signals
sampled at ~0.3-1.4 Hz (scanner repetition time  TR of 0.72-3.3 s). GPFA enables the discovery
of hidden (latent) dimensions in the data [11]  with each latent dimension comprising a collection
of channels that exhibit shared variance in their activity at a speciﬁc timescale. In our case  this
approach enabled us to identify functionally connected networks of brain regions  whose dynamics
evolve at diverse  characteristic timescales.
We also asked if slow ﬂuctuations in fMRI latent dimensions discovered by GPFA would be suf-
ﬁciently informative about task-speciﬁc cognitive states. While previous studies have examined
slow  spontaneous dynamics in the resting state (e.g. [12])  we examined these dynamics with GPFA
applied to both task-based and resting state fMRI scans  from 1000 healthy human participants
drawn from the human connectome project (HCP) database [13]. These fMRI scans were acquired
as subjects performed each of seven cognitive tasks – including tasks of working memory  story
comprehension  gambling  and the like (Supporting Information Table S2) – or in the resting state. We
discovered that GPFA activity in latent dimensions with characteristic slow and infra-slow timescales
was remarkably synchronized across individuals’ brains. Moreover  these slow GPFA dynamics could
be used to predict with high accuracies (typically over 95%)  task-speciﬁc cognitive states. Finally 
applying GPFA to resting state fMRI data from patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)  we
show that infra-slow oscillations in these latent dimensions sufﬁced to distinguish  signiﬁcantly above
chance  MCI patients who later developed AD from those who did not. We propose that slow and
infra-slow fMRI dynamics may be relevant for a complete understanding of cognitive function  in
health and in disease.

Identifying latent fMRI dimensions with slow  characteristic timescales

2
GPFA extracts smooth  low-dimensional latent trajectories from noisy  high-dimensional time series
[11]. Brieﬂy  GPFA ﬁrst performs dimensionality reduction with conventional factor analysis (FA) to
identify an initial set of latent dimensions. This is followed by learning key parameters that specify
the temporal autocorrelation of the latent dimensions (Fig. 1A). The parameters of the GPFA model
are learned with an expectation-maximization algorithm. GPFA  therefore  provides a method for
simultaneously performing smoothing and dimensionality reduction on the fMRI data. As with
FA  GPFA incorporates an explicit noise model  which in the case of fMRI data enables estimating
independent noise variances across different brain regions. Details regarding the model are described
in [11] and in the Supporting Information (section 1).
We analyzed fMRI data from 1000 human participants (529 females  typical age range: 22-35 years 
10 subjects of age >36 years) drawn from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database (total
of 8000 scans). These scans were acquired when subjects were performing one of seven tasks
(Supporting Information Table S2) or were resting inside the scanner (resting state); scanning and
acquisition protocols are described elsewhere [13]. We used minimally preprocessed scans available
from the HCP database; such preprocessing minimizes noise due to extraneous sources  such as
scanner-related distortions or head movements inside the scanner [14]. Typically  each fMRI scan
comprises a 4-dimensional dataset (91×109×91 voxels in space  and 176 − 405 time points). As a
ﬁrst step  we parcellated the brain into 264 functionally-deﬁned regions of interest (ROIs) using the
Power et al [15] parcellation  which groups functionally related voxels into non-overlapping ROIs.
GPFA was run on the parcellated fMRI time-series to extract task-speciﬁc latent dimensions  and
their associated trajectories. For this  we employed scans from 100 subjects (IDs in red in Supporting
Information  Table S1)  and the ﬁrst 100 timepoints from each ROI (Fig. 1D  break in time axis).
Before applying GPFA  we conﬁrmed that a majority of these time series (~80%) satisﬁed Gaussianity
assumptions as assessed by the Lilliefors test for normality. These timeseries were z-scored for each
ROI separately and provided as input to the GPFA algorithm. Each subject was treated as a distinct
experimental trial  and the GPFA model was trained with 4-fold cross validation (parameters trained
on 75 subjects  and tested on 25 subjects  in each fold). Prediction errors were computed  with the test
subjects’ data  across a range of latent dimensions (5-100). The optimal number of latent dimensions

was then determined as the one that minimized prediction error  using a leave-region-out approach
(further elaborated in the Supporting Information  section 1).
This approach revealed a clear minimum of the prediction error  corresponding to optimal reduced
dimensionality for the fMRI data (Fig. 1B) for each of the 7 tasks and resting state: the minimum
number of latent dimensions ranged from 39-44  indicating a nearly 6-fold reduction in data dimen-
sionality. For further analysis  we determined a common number of optimal latent dimensions (u=42)
across tasks  by minimizing the overall prediction error (Supporting Information  section 1). GPFA
was then run  again  for each task with this common number of latent dimensions.
Each latent dimension i (= 1  ...  p) estimated by GPFA can be described by the following quantities
(Fig. 1A): i) a time series given by xi : = [xi 1  xi 2  . . .   xi T ]; ii) the ith column of the mapping
matrix C  which speciﬁes the contribution of each of the 264 brain regions  to latent dimension
i  which we term the “spatial map” associated with the ith latent dimension. This map may be
interpreted as a group (or network) of brain regions exhibiting shared latent dynamics governed by
xi; and iii) a characteristic timescale for that latent dimension  τi.
Across all tasks GPFA latent dimensions exhibited a bimodal distribution of timescales (Supporting
Information  Fig. S2)  with nearly 75% of dimensions exhibiting timescales slower than 1000 ms
(1 Hz) (Fig. 1C  timescales pooled across tasks). Figure 1D shows a representative set of latent
dimensions at slow and fast timescales obtained from the resting state scans. The slow timescale
dimension (Figure 1D  top) exhibited a characteristic timescale of τ=3060 ms. The spatial map
for this dimension revealed a pattern characteristic of the default mode network (DMN)  a widely-
documented resting-state brain network comprising the medial prefrontal cortex  posterior cingulate
cortex  precuneus and angular gyrus [16]. On the other hand  the fast timescale dimension (Figure 1D 
bottom) exhibited a characteristic timescale of τ=447 ms  which was faster than the sampling

artifacts  estimated from ﬁts to residual noise after accounting for slow latents (see also Supporting
Information  section 2).

3 Classifying task-speciﬁc cognitive states with slow latent dynamics
Next  we tested whether these latent dimensions carried information about task-speciﬁc cognitive
states: Could examining these latent dimensions for each individual subject permit classifying the
cognitive task that that subject was performing inside the scanner? For this  we designated the spatial
maps computed by running GPFA on 100 subjects’ data as “template” maps (42 per task scan) and
then averaged the latent trajectories across these subjects as “template” trajectories (also 42 per task
scan  each corresponding to one template map).
We employed these “template” latent dimensions to classify task-speciﬁc cognitive states for the
remaining 900 subjects (“test” data; Supporting Information  Algorithm S1). Brieﬂy  the time series
x(t) for some task scan s  for each subject in the test dataset  was projected onto the template maps
of each of the eight tasks. This procedure generated a latent time series for each test subject’s scan s 
and was repeated with template maps from all eight scans. Following this the correlation between
each test subject’s projected (latent GPFA) trajectories and the template trajectories for each scan
was computed  and summed across components  to get an overall similarity score. The template scan
with the maximum overall similarity score with the test subject’s scan  was assigned as the predicted
task label for the test subject’s scan. This was repeated for each scan  s=1-8  for each of the 900 test
subjects  and all scans were assigned a speciﬁc label.
This approach (Fig. 2A) provided superlative accuracies for classifying among the seven different
task states (confusion matrix; Fig. 2B). Median accuracy was 97.8%  and accuracies ranged from
96.7%-99.8%; all accuracies were signiﬁcantly above chance (permutation test  p < 0.001). A clear
exception was the resting state scan  which was often misclassiﬁed as a task scan. Nevertheless  this
was an expected outcome because resting state data are not expected to be time-locked across subjects

and scans. Therefore  estimating temporal correlations across latent GPFA dimensions should not be
able to meaningfully identify the resting state. On the other hand  because the tasks performed by
subjects all followed the same time-course  latent dimensions exhibited sufﬁcient temporal structure –
which was common and coordinated across subjects – to enable accurate classiﬁcation. We repeated
the classiﬁcation limiting the time series to only those GP dimensions with slow timescales (<1Hz)
and found comparably superlative accuracies across the seven tasks (median: 98%   range: 96.5% -
99.5% ). In addition  classiﬁcation analysis following GPFA with a different (90-node) functional
parcellation [17] also produced similar classiﬁcation accuracies (Supporting Information  section 2 
SI Fig. S3B)  indicating that these results were not unique to a speciﬁc parcellation. Moreover  GPFA
time series could distinguish  with superlative accuracies (range: 81%-99%) distinct sub-tasks within
each task performed by the subjects inside the scanner (SI  section 2  Fig. S3D).
Next  we asked which spatial maps in the template data  were most representative of each task scan.
For this we identiﬁed  for each task scan  the template dimension whose time series exhibited the
highest correlation with the latent dimensions of the test dataset  for the corresponding scan (average
correlation across n=900 test subjects). In other words  these dimensions represent brain networks
which exhibited the most consistent dynamics (across subjects) for each task. Distinct and meaningful
structure emerged in the spatial maps for each task. For instance  the language task showed clearly
lateralized activation in the left superior temporal cortex  which includes the auditory cortex and
language processing regions (Fig. 3A top left). The motor task  on the other hand  showed bilateral
activation in the precentral gyrus  the location of the motor cortex (Fig. 3A top right). Other tasks 
and the associated spatial maps  are shown in the Supporting Information (Fig. S1). Notably  we
observed a strongly right hemisphere lateralized map for the gambling task (Fig. S1D)  consistent
with the ﬁndings of a recent study which showed that right lateralized brain activity was predictive of
risk-taking behaviors [18].
We observed highly synchronized dynamics in the latent dimensions across subjects for each task
(Fig. S1  second row). The average two dimensional latent trajectory for the template subjects
(Fig. 3A  bottom  and Fig. S1  third row  yellow traces)  were closely aligned with the average

5

trajectory for the test subjects (Fig. 3A  bottom  and Fig. S1  third row  gray traces)  providing clear
evidence for task-speciﬁc inter-subject synchronization of brain dynamics (see Discussion). We
examined the degree of inter-subject synchronization  with a view to distinguishing task-relevant
latent dimensions from task-irrelevant ones. We hypothesized that the strength of inter-subject
synchronization within each latent dimension would index the task-relevance of that dimension. For
example  artifacts  such as scanner noise or physiological noise  are unlikely to be synchronized
across subjects  whereas dimensions strongly locked to salient aspects of the task would be highly
synchronized. To quantify the degree of inter-subject synchronization for each latent dimension 
we computed a “synchronization index”: the average correlation between the template latent time
series and the projected latent time series of each of the test subjects. A higher synchronization
index indicates a higher degree of phase locking (or synchronization) of the test subjects’ latent time
series with the template time series. Slower timescale dimensions exhibited systematically stronger
synchronization indices  as compared to faster dimensions; Fig. 2C shows this trend for working
memory task (all tasks shown in SI Fig. S2). These results are consistent with the proposal that 
across tasks  faster (>1 Hz) timescale dimensions reﬂected scanner artifact and noise  and slower
(<1 Hz) timescale dimensions reﬂected task-relevant brain processes. They also suggest the potential
utility of GPFA for denoising fMRI time series data (see Discussion).
We also tested if the power spectrum of GPFA latent dimensions contained sufﬁcient information
to distinguish among the tasks. For this  we ﬁrst estimated the power spectrum of each dimension
for each task using multitaper spectral estimation [19]. Next  we estimated and subtracted out the
broadband (fractal or 1/f) component  using the IRASA (irregular-resampling auto-spectral analysis)
method [20]  to retain speciﬁcally the oscillatory component of the spectrum up to one quarter of the
sampling rate (0.35 Hz). These oscillation power spectra were averaged across the template subjects
(n=100) to form a “template” spectrum for each task and latent dimension (SI Fig. S4). As before  to
classify each task scan of the “test” subjects’ (n=900) data  we projected their timeseries based on
the template spatial maps  computed the oscillatory spectra and correlated these with the oscillatory
spectra of each template to identify the best matching template (Fig. 2A). Again  we discovered
above-chance accuracies for task classiﬁcation based on oscillation spectra: accuracies ranged from
34.7%-83.7% across the 7 tasks  with a median accuracy of 57.8% (p<0.01  permutation test).
We also performed additional control analyses to test if these results were speciﬁc to GPFA  or could
be achieved with other dimensionality reduction approaches; these are described in the Supporting
Information (section 2). Brieﬂy  we reduced dimensionality either by selecting a subset of regions
(ROIs) based on their activity correlation with the fMRI task timeseries  or with principal components
analysis (PCA). In each case we compared the accuracy of task classiﬁcation based on GPFA features
– time series or oscillation spectra – with the accuracies obtained with these other approaches. Both
GPFA latent spectra and time series provided signiﬁcantly higher accuracies in classifying task-
speciﬁc cognitive states  compared with at least one of the features in each of the other approaches
(p<0.05  Wilcoxon signed rank text  Fig. 2D and Fig. 2E; details in SI section 2) .
We asked if  in addition to being able to identify task-speciﬁc cognitive states  GPFA latent dynamics
would also be relevant as a marker of cognitive traits. We computed the functional connectivity
between every pair of GPFA latent dimensions  based on partial correlations  for each subject. With
these functional connectivity matrices as features  we sought to predict inter-individual differences in
27 cognitive scores acquired outside of the scanning session [21] (SI Table S3)  using connectome-
based predictive modeling (CPM; [22]). Behavioral scores were selected from Alertness  Cognition
and Motor categories (HCP Data Dictionary)  with the goal of avoiding redundant scores (e.g.
sensitivity and speciﬁcity were included  but not also true and false positive rates). All scores were
selected “blind” to (without a priori knowledge of) the results of these prediction analyses. Scores
were predicted with 10-fold cross validation: by estimating the CPM model on a training fold with
nine-tenths of the data while predicting scores on each left-out “test” fold (one-tenth of the data)  in
turn.
Many scores could be predicted signiﬁcantly and almost universally across tasks (Fig. 3B  black
squares; p<0.01 with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons). These included
scores of motor performance  ﬂuid intelligence  linguistic ability and spatial orientation (Fig. 3B-C).
Although the proportion of explained variance was comparatively low (mean r=0.16  range: 0.08-
0.34)  this range of correlations were similar to that observed in previous studies employing functional
connectivity features for behavioral score predictions [23  24]). On the other hand  scores associated
with sustained attention  mental state or memory were predicted well with only some tasks or not at all.

6

We speculate that these differences may arise from the degree of mismatch between fMRI timescales
and characteristic timescales for behavioral tasks used to measure these scores: Tasks engaging neural
processes at timescales matching fMRI timescales (e.g. language or ﬂuid intelligence) were possibly
better predicted than those engaging processes at much faster (e.g. attention) or much slower (e.g.
mental state) timescales. Overall  the results suggest that connectivity estimated with slow  latent
fMRI processes may be relevant for predicting traits across several cognitive domains.

4 Predicting cognitive decline with infra-slow latent dynamics

As a second  key application of our approach  we sought to test whether infra-slow brain dynamics
could serve as markers of cognitive decline. For this  we obtained resting state brain imaging (fMRI)
scans from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).
Among the large number of patient datasets in this database  we utilized data from a subset of
patients with Mild Cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI patients typically exhibit symptoms associated
with decline of memory  language or thinking  that are usually more pronounced than normally
aging adults. Nevertheless  only some proportion of such MCI patients progress to develop severe
forms of dementia  like Alzheimer’s Dementia (AD)  as assessed by standard clinical ratings (e.g.
clinical dementia rating  CDR). We term those MCI patients who progressed to develop AD as “MCI
converters” (MCIc) and those who did not as “MCI stable” (MCIs) (Fig. 4B). Our goal was to test if
infra-slow brain dynamics  as estimated with GPFA on resting fMRI data  would enable classifying
MCIc from MCIs patients.
We analyzed resting state fMRI data for n=23 MCIc (age:72.7 ± 6.9 yrs  11 females) and n=72
MCIs patients (age:71.6 ± 6.8 yrs  32 females). For MCIs patients  scans were included only if
the patient remained stably diagnosed as MCI for at least two years. For MCIc patients  scans
were typically acquired 6 to 36 months (median: 12 months) prior to conversion to AD. One MCIc
subject was excluded due to corrupted brain imaging data  so that data from a total of n=94 patients
was analyzed. A standard pipeline was used to preprocess the scans and parcellate the brain into
264 regions  based on the Power et al. parcellation [15]. We then extracted latent dimensions by
applying GPFA to parcellated fMRI time series  concatenated across all subjects (MCIc and MCIs).
As before  we obtained an optimal number of latent dimensions (u=77) with a prediction error
minimization approach. Because only resting state fMRI data was available from MCI patients no
useful information could be obtained by examining correlations between different patients’ latent
trajectories. This is because brain ﬂuctuations in the resting state are uncontrolled  in the absence
of external task events. Thus  we sought features in the resting state GPFA dimensions that did not
require consistent phase relationships between latent time series across subjects.
First  we computed partial correlations (PC) and lagged covariance (LC) between every pair of latent
dimensions for each subject (Supporting Information  Section 4). These features are indicative of
instantaneous or lagged connectivity across brain regions for each subject [25]  and do not require
activity to be synchronized across subjects. We then trained a linear classiﬁer based on support
vector machines (SVM) with PC and LC features as input  and distinct labels for the MCIc and MCIs
patients  using Matlab’s ﬁtclinear function (Fig. 4A). As the numbers of selected MCIc scans (n=22)
and MCIs scans (n=72) were substantially different  a balanced classes approach was used prior to
classiﬁcation to prevent classiﬁer bias (Supporting Information  section 4).
Classiﬁcation accuracy based on PC connectivity features was 61.2% whereas that based on LC
connectivity features was 71.0%. Combining the two sets of features provided a marginally lower
classiﬁcation accuracy of 63.6%; each of these accuracies were signiﬁcantly above chance as assessed
with a permutation test based on shufﬂing labels (p<0.05; Supporting Information  section 4). To ﬁnd
a minimal set of features that provided the highest cross-validation accuracy (area-under-the-curve
or AUC) we applied recursive feature elimination (RFE) including both PC and LC features [26]
(Supporting Information  section 4). RFE retained only 15% (1332) features of the 8855 PC+LC
features  and these few features sufﬁced to achieve a comparatively high classiﬁcation accuracy of
73.6%. The top ranked three features  with the highest SVM beta weights  were all PC connections:
the highest beta weights occurred for a PC connection between a predominantly left lateralized
occipito-parietal map and a bilateral temporal map (Fig. 4C). The next two beta weights occurred for
connections involving the fronto-insular cortex  and the anterior cingulate cortex (SI Fig. S5). These
maps overlap strongly with the fronto-parietal “attention” network  and a cingulo-opercular “salience”
network  conventionally implicated in attention and executive control  respectively [27].

Second  we tested if the power spectrum of the latent dimensions sufﬁced to classify between MCIc
and MCIs subjects. As before  we computed the power spectrum for each component and subject and
removed the broadband (1/f) component to retain only the oscillatory component (with IRASA). We
then used these oscillatory power spectra (Fig. 4D) as features in an SVM classiﬁer using a balanced
classes approach  as discussed above. In this case  due to the slower sampling rate (longer repeat
time) of the fMRI scan (0.3 Hz) compared to the HCP data (1.4 Hz)  we included for the classiﬁcation
only frequencies up to ~0.08 Hz (infra-slow band)  sampled uniformly at 32 values (total of 2464
features). Classiﬁcation accuracy based on the SVM was 65.1%  and signiﬁcantly above chance  as
assessed by a permutation test (p<0.05). As before  following RFE  we discovered that  on average 
only 28% (681/2464) features were retained whereas accuracy following RFE improved marginally
to 67.2%.
Finally  we evaluated the ability of slow latent dynamics to predict a graded measure of cognitive
decline. We predicted individual patients’ CDR-SOB (CDR-sum of boxes) scores that measure
severity of dementia [28]  based on the resting fMRI scan obtained in the same visit. We ﬁt a
regression model with an L1 penalty (Matlab’s lasso function) to predict CDR-SOB scores  separately 
with power spectral features and with LC and PC features  with a k-fold cross validation approach
(k=2  4  23  46  92; Supporting Information  section 4). The accuracy of prediction increased steadily
with more folds  perhaps because of the small sample size and consequent bias with limited training
data for small k. Leave-one-out cross-validation provided the most accurate predictions with power
spectral features yielding a strong correlation (r=0.56  p<0.001  Fig. 4E left) between predicted and
observed scores. LC and PC features yielded a marginally lower  but signiﬁcant  prediction (r=0.34 
p<0.001  Fig. 4E right).
Taken together  these analyses indicate that slow and infra-slow ﬂuctuations in resting state fMRI data
are reliable biomarkers that distinguish between MCI patients who converted to AD versus those who
did not. Moreover  the results suggested compromised function in putative attention-related brain
networks that could be indicative of progression to AD. Finally  slow dynamics in these networks
predicted inter-individual differences in cognitive decline  as assessed by CDR-SOB scores.

5 Discussion
Slow (0.1-1 Hz) and infra-slow (<0.1 Hz) ﬂuctuations in spontaneously generated electrical activity
of the brain have been widely observed with various recording modalities  including local ﬁeld
potential microelectrode recordings [29]  optical recordings [30]  electrocorticography [31  32] and
electro- and magnetoencephalography [33]. Here  we examined whether such slow ﬂuctuations 
as estimated with GPFA applied on fMRI data  would be informative for understanding cognitive
processes in healthy brains  and cognitive decline in diseased brains.
Applying GPFA to fMRI data revealed several key insights. First  GPFA reduced the dimensionality
of the data by 3-6 fold  indicating signiﬁcant redundancy in the data. This signiﬁcant reduction
in dimensionality is a consequence of the shared variance of the fMRI BOLD response across
multiple regions. This shared variance could be exploited to produce sparse representations of fMRI
brain activity. Moreover  it is possible that an even higher reduction in dimensionality could be
obtained with GPFA applied to voxel-level fMRI data. At present  computational costs associated
with scaling up GPFA to the voxel level prohibit such an application  and highlight the need for
developing more efﬁcient algorithms for voxel-level GPFA. Second  GPFA provides a key advantage
over other dimensionality reduction techniques  like independent components analysis (ICA) [34]  in
that GPFA directly estimates latent dimensions with distinct  characteristic timescales. This feature
enabled us to show that GP dimensions with fast timescale dynamics (>1 Hz) were not synchronized
across subjects  and likely reﬂected artifactual processes (e.g. high frequency scanner noise). Prior
knowledge about the timescales of scanner or physiological artifacts could be directly incorporated
into the EM algorithm when estimating GPFA parameters  thereby permitting concurrent denoising
of fMRI data.
On the other hand  GPFA latent dimensions with comparatively slower timescale dynamics (<1 Hz)
were strongly synchronized across subjects (Fig. 2C  SI Fig. S2). Previous studies have reported
inter-subject synchronization of cortical responses  at multiple different timescales. Studies that
used either fMRI [35] or MEG [36] to image brain activity showed that cortical activity is highly
synchronized across subjects experiencing naturalistic stimuli  either visual (e.g. movies) or auditory
(e.g. music)  particularly when salient events occur in the stimulus stream [37  38]. A related study
with task-based fMRI identiﬁed brain networks that showed consistent synchrony across the subject
population[39]. Moreover  a key advantage of using GPFA over previous approaches is that GPFA
provides considerable ﬂexibility with identifying a variety of brain network dynamics. Alternative
GP covariance kernels  such as a periodic kernel or a linear kernel [40] can help identify periodic
ﬂuctuations or drifts  respectively  in the fMRI data  which could then be matched with relevant task
covariates of interest  or factored out as noisy confounds. For example  some types of motion artifacts 
arising due to overt behavioral responses in the scanner  could be synchronized across subjects  and
these could be identiﬁed and denoised with GPFA.
Our results suggest that BOLD dynamics that occur at infra-slow (~0.1Hz) timescales may serve
as markers for cognitive function in health  and  cognitive decline  in disease. Understanding
the link between these BOLD dynamics and dynamics of underlying neural processes remains an
important open question. Despite this caveat  our approach is relevant for developing non-invasive 
imaging-based biomarkers for early detection of cognitive impairment. For example  changes in slow
and infra-slow BOLD dynamics can be measured longitudinally  over several years  as a potential
biomarker for predicting the onset and trajectory of cognitive decline in AD  and could form the basis
for early intervention before severe behavioral symptoms of cognitive decline manifest.
