Abstract

We describe an approach to learning from long-tailed  imbalanced datasets that
are prevalent in real-world settings. Here  the challenge is to learn accurate “few-
shot” models for classes in the tail of the class distribution  for which little data
is available. We cast this problem as transfer learning  where knowledge from
the data-rich classes in the head of the distribution is transferred to the data-poor
classes in the tail. Our key insights are as follows. First  we propose to transfer
meta-knowledge about learning-to-learn from the head classes. This knowledge is
encoded with a meta-network that operates on the space of model parameters  that
is trained to predict many-shot model parameters from few-shot model parameters.
Second  we transfer this meta-knowledge in a progressive manner  from classes
in the head to the “body”  and from the “body” to the tail. That is  we transfer
knowledge in a gradual fashion  regularizing meta-networks for few-shot regression
with those trained with more training data. This allows our ﬁnal network to capture
a notion of model dynamics  that predicts how model parameters are likely to
change as more training data is gradually added. We demonstrate results on
image classiﬁcation datasets (SUN  Places  and ImageNet) tuned for the long-tailed
setting  that signiﬁcantly outperform common heuristics  such as data resampling
or reweighting.

1 Motivation

Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have revolutionized the landscape of visual recognition 
through the ability to learn “big models” with hundreds of millions of parameters [1  2  3  4]. Such
models are typically learned with artiﬁcially balanced datasets [5  6  7]  in which objects of different
classes have approximately evenly distributed  very large number of human-annotated images. In
real-world applications  however  visual phenomena follow a long-tailed distribution as shown in
Fig. 1  in which the number of training examples per class varies signiﬁcantly from hundreds or
thousands for head classes to as few as one for tail classes [8  9  10].
Long-tail: Minimizing the skewed distribution by collecting more tail examples is a notoriously
difﬁcult task when constructing datasets [11  6  12  10]. Even those datasets that are balanced along
one dimension still tend to be imbalanced in others [13]; e.g.  balanced scene datasets still contain
long-tail sets of objects [14] or scene subclasses [8]. This intrinsic long-tail property poses a multitude
of open challenges for recognition in the wild [15]  since the models will be largely dominated by
those few head classes while degraded for many other tail classes. Rebalancing training data [16  17]
is the most widespread state-of-the-art solution  but this is heuristic and suboptimal — it merely
generates redundant data through over-sampling or loses critical information through under-sampling.
Head-to-tail knowledge transfer: An attractive alternative is to transfer knowledge from data-rich
head classes to data-poor tail classes. While transfer learning from a source to target task is a well
studied problem [18  19]  by far the most common approach is ﬁne-tuning a model pre-trained on the
source task [20]. In the long-tailed setting  this fails to provide any noticeable improvement since

(b) Knowledge transfer from head to tail classes.

(a) Long-tail distribution on the SUN-397 dataset.
Figure 1: Head-to-tail knowledge transfer in model space for long-tail recognition. Fig. 1a shows
the number of examples by scene class on SUN-397 [14]  a representative dataset that follows an
intrinsic long-tailed distribution. In Fig. 1b  from the data-rich head classes (e.g.  living rooms)  we
introduce a meta-learner F to learn the model dynamics — a series of transformations (denoted
as solid lines) that represents how few k-shot models θk start from θ1 and gradually evolve to the
underlying many-shot models θ∗ trained from large sets of samples. The model parameters θ are
visualized as points in the “dual” model (parameter) space. We leverage the model dynamics as prior
knowledge to facilitate recognizing tail classes (e.g.  libraries) by hallucinating their model evolution
trajectories (denoted as dashed lines).

pre-training on the head is quite similar to training on the unbalanced long-tailed dataset (which is
dominated by the head) [10].
Transferring meta-knowledge: Inspired by the recent work on meta-learning [21  22  23  24  25  26] 
we instead transfer meta-level knowledge about learning to learn from the head classes. Speciﬁcally 
we make use of the approach of [21]  which describes a method for learning from small datasets (the
“few-shot” learning problem) through estimating a generic model transformation. To do so  [21]
learns a meta-level network that operates on the space of model parameters  which is speciﬁcally
trained to regress many-shot model parameters (trained on large datasets) from few-shot model
parameters (trained on small datasets). Our meta-level regressor  which we call MetaModelNet  is
trained on classes from the head of the distribution and then applied to those from the tail. As an
illustrative example in Fig. 1  consider learning scene classiﬁers on a long-tailed dataset with many
living-rooms but few outside libraries. We learn both many-shot and few-shot living-room models
(by subsampling the training data as needed)  and train a regressor that maps between the two. We
can then apply the regressor on few-shot models of libraries learned from the tail.
Progressive transfer: The above description suggests that we need to split up a long-tailed training
set into a distinct set of source classes (the head) and target classes (the tail). This is most naturally
done by thresholding the number of training examples per class. But what is the correct threshold?
A high threshold might result in a meta-network that simply acts as an identity function  returning
the input set of model parameters. This certainly would not be useful to apply on few-shot models.
Similarly  a low threshold may not be useful when regressing from many-shot models. Instead 
we propose a “continuous” strategy that builds multiple regressors across a (logarithmic) range of
thresholds (e.g.  1-shot  2-shot  4-shot regressors  etc.)  corresponding to different head-tail splits.
Importantly  these regressors can be efﬁciently implemented with a single  chained MetaModelNet
that is naturally regularized with residual connections  such that the 2-shot regressor need only predict
model parameters that are fed into the 4-shot regressor  and so on (until the many-shot regressor
that defaults to the identity). By doing so  MetaModelNet encodes a trajectory over the space of
model parameters that captures their evolution with increasing sample sizes  as shown in Fig. 1b.
Interestingly  such a network is naturally trained in a progressive manner from the head towards the
tail  effectively capturing the gradual dynamics of transferring meta-knowledge from data-rich to
data-poor regimes.
Model dynamics: It is natural to ask what kind of dynamics are learned by MetaModelNet — how
can one consistently predict how model parameters will change with more training data? We posit that
the network learns to capture implicit data augmentation — for example  given a 1-shot model trained
with a single image  the network may learn to implicitly add rotations of that single image. But rather

Interestingly  past work tends to apply the same augmentation strategies across all input classes. But
perhaps different classes should be augmented in different ways — e.g.  churches maybe viewed
from consistent viewpoints and should not be augmented with out-of-plane rotations. MetaModelNet
learns class-speciﬁc transformations that are smooth across the space of models — e.g.  classes with
similar model parameters tend to transform in similar ways (see Fig. 1b and Fig. 4 for more details).
Our contributions are three-fold. (1) We analyze the dynamics of how model parameters evolve
when given access to more training examples. (2) We show that a single meta-network  based on deep
residual learning  can learn to accurately predict such dynamics. (3) We train such a meta-network on
long-tailed datasets through a recursive approach that gradually transfers meta-knowledge learned
from the head to the tail  signiﬁcantly improving long-tail recognition on a broad range of tasks.

2 Related Work

A widespread yet suboptimal strategy is to resample and rebalance training data in the presence of the
long tail  either by sampling examples from the rare classes more frequently [16  17]  or reducing the
number of examples from the common classes [27]. The former generates redundancy and quickly
runs into the problem of over-ﬁtting to the rare classes  whereas the latter loses critical information
contained within the large-sample sets. An alternative practice is to introduce additional weights for
different classes  which  however  makes optimization of the models very difﬁcult in the large-scale
recognition scenarios [28].
Our underlying assumption that model parameters across different classes share similar dynamics
is somewhat common in meta-learning [21  22  25]. While [22  25] consider the dynamics during
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization  we address the dynamics as more training data is
gradually made available. In particular  the model regression network from [21] empirically shows a
generic nonlinear transformation from small-sample to large-sample models for different types of
feature spaces and classiﬁer models. We extend [21] for long-tail recognition by introducing a single
network that can model transformations across different samples sizes. To train such a network  we
introduce recursive algorithms for head-to-tail transfer learning and architectural modiﬁcations based
on deep residual networks (that ensure that transformations of large-sample models default to the
identity).
Our approach is broadly related to different meta-learning concepts such as learning-to-learn  transfer
learning  and multi-task learning [29  30  18  31]. Such approaches tend to learn shared structures
from a set of relevant tasks and generalize to novel tasks. Speciﬁcally  our approach is inspired
by early work on parameter prediction that modiﬁes the weights of one network using another [32 
33  34  35  36  37  38  26  39]. Such techniques have also been recently explored in the context of
regressing classiﬁer weights from training sample [40  41  42]. From an optimization perspective 
our approach is related to work on learning to optimize  which replaces hand-designed update rules
(e.g.  SGD) with a learned update rule [22  24  25].
The most related formulation is that of one/few-shot learning [43  44  45  46  47  48  21  49  35 
50  23  51  52  53  54  55  56]. Past work has explored strategies of using the common knowledge
captured among a set of one-shot learning tasks during meta-training for a novel one-shot learning
problem [52  25  35  53]. These techniques  however  are typically developed for a ﬁxed set of
few-shot tasks  in which each class has the same  ﬁxed number of training samples. They appear
difﬁcult to generalize to novel tasks with a wide range of sample sizes  the hallmark of long-tail
recognition.

3 Head-to-Tail Meta-Knowledge Transfer

Given a long-tail recognition task of interest and a base recognition model such as a deep CNN  our
goal is to transfer knowledge from the data-rich head to the data-poor tail classes. As shown in Fig. 1 
knowledge is represented as trajectories in model space that capture the evolution of parameters with
more and more training examples. We train a meta-learner (MetaModelNet) to learn such model
dynamics from head classes  and then “hallucinate” the evolution of parameters for the tail classes.
To simplify exposition  we ﬁrst describe the approach for a ﬁxed split of our training dataset into a
head and tail. We then generalize the approach to multiple splits.

as a deep residual network with residual blocks i = 0  1  . . .   N in Fig. 2a  which accepts few-shot
model parameters θ (trained on small datasets across a logarithmic range of sample sizes k  k = 2i)
as (multiple) inputs and regresses them to many-shot model parameters θ∗ (trained on large datasets)
as output. The skip connections ensure the identity regularization. Fi denotes the meta-learner that
transforms (regresses) k-shot θ to θ∗. Fig. 2b shows the structure of the residual blocks. Note that
the meta-learners Fi for different k are derived from this single  chained meta-network  with nested
circles (subnetworks) corresponding to Fi.

3.1 Fixed-size model transformations

Let us write Ht for the “head” training set of (x  y) data-label pairs constructed by assembling those
classes for which there exist more than t training examples. We will use Ht to learn a meta-network
thats maps few-shot model parameters to many-shot parameters  and then apply this network on
few-shot models from the tail classes. To do so  we closely follow the model regression framework
from [21]  but introduce notation that will be useful later. Let us write a base learner as g(x; θ) as a
feedforward function g(·) that processes an input sample x given parameters θ. We ﬁrst learn a set
of “optimal” model parameters θ∗ by tuning g on Ht with a standard loss function. We also learn
few-shot models by randomly sampling a smaller ﬁxed number of examples per class from Ht. We
then train a meta-network F(·) to map or regress the few-shot parameters to θ∗.
Parameters: In principle  F(·) applies to model parameters from multiple CNN layers. Directly
regressing parameters from all layers is  however  difﬁcult to do because of the larger number of
parameters. For example  recent similar methods for meta-learning tend to restrict themselves to
smaller toy networks [22  25]. For now  we focus on parameters from the last fully-connected layer
for a single class — e.g.  θ ∈ R4096 for an AlexNet architecture. This allows us to learn regressors
that are shared across classes (as in [21])  and so can be applied to any individual test class. This
is particularly helpful in the long-tailed setting  where the number of classes in the tail tends to
outnumber the head. Later we will show that (nonlinear) ﬁne-tuning of the “entire network” during
head-to-tail transfer can further improve performance.
Loss function: The meta-network F(·) is itself parameterized with weights w. The objective function

for each class is: (cid:88)

The ﬁnal loss is averaged over all the head classes and minimized with respect to w. Here  kShot(Ht)
is the set of few-shot models learned by subsampling k examples per class from Ht  and loss refers to
the performance loss used to train the base network (e.g.  cross-entropy). λ > 0 is the regularization
parameter used to control the trade-off between the two terms. [21] found that the performance loss
was useful to learn regressors that maintained high accuracy on the base task. This formulation can
be viewed as an extension to those in [21  25]. With only the performance loss  Eqn. (1) reduces to
the loss function in [25]. When the performance loss is evaluated on the subsampled set  Eqn. (1)
reduces to the loss function in [21].

to set k = t  but this implies that there will be some head classes near the cutoff that have only
t training examples  implying θ and θ∗ will be identical. To ensure that a meaningful mapping is
learned  we set

k = t/2.

In other terms  we intentionally learn very-few-shot models to ensure that target model parameters
are sufﬁciently more general.

3.2 Recursive residual transformations

We wish to apply the above module on all possible head-tail splits of a long-tailed training set. To do
so  we extend the above approach in three crucial ways:

• (Sample-size dependency) Generate a sequence of different meta-learners Fi each tuned for
a speciﬁc k  where k = k(i) is an increasing function of i (that will be speciﬁed shortly).
Through a straightforward extension  prior work on model regression [21] learns a single
ﬁxed meta-learner for all the k-shot regression tasks.

• (Identity regularization) Ensure that the meta-learner defaults to the identity function for

large i: Fi → I as i → ∞.

• (Compositionality) Compose meta-learners out of each other: ∀i < j  Fi(θ) = Fj

where Fij is the regressor that maps between k(i)-shot and k(j)-shot models.

(cid:16)Fij(θ)
(cid:17)

Here we dropped the explicit dependence of F(·) on w for notational simplicity. These observations
emphasize the importance of (1) the identity regularization and (2) sample-size dependent regressors
for long-tailed model transfer. We operationalize these extensions with a recursive residual network:

(cid:16)

Fi(θ) = Fi+1

(cid:17)

θ + f (θ; wi)

 

(2)

where f denotes a residual block parameterized by wi and visualized in Fig. 2b. Inspired by [57  21] 
f consists of batch normalization (BN) and leaky ReLU as pre-activation  followed by fully-connected
weights. By construction  each residual block transforms an input k(i)-shot model to a k(i + 1)-shot
model. The ﬁnal MetaModelNet can be efﬁciently implemented through a chained network of N + 1
residual blocks  as shown in Fig. 2a. By feeding in a few-shot model at a particular block  we can
derive any meta-learner Fi from the central underlying chain.

3.3 Training

Given the network structure deﬁned above  we now describe an efﬁcient method for training based on
two insights. (1) The recursive deﬁnition of MetaModelNet suggests a recursive strategy for training.
We begin with the last block and train it with the largest threshold (e.g.  those few classes in the head
with many examples). The associated k-shot regressor should be easy to learn because it is similar to
an identity mapping. Given the learned parameters for the last block  we then train the next-to-last
block  and so on. (2) Inspired by the general observation that recognition performance improves
on a logarithmic scale as the number of training samples increases [8  9  58]  we discretize blocks
accordingly  to be tuned for 1-shot  2-shot  4-shot  ... recognition. In terms of notation  we write the
recursive training procedure as follows. We iterate over blocks i from N to 0  and for each i:

• Using Eqn. (1)  train parameters of the residual block wi on the head split Ht with k-shot

model regression  where k = 2i and t = 2k = 2i+1.

The above “back-to-front” training procedure works because whenever block i is trained  all subse-
quent blocks (i + 1  . . .   N ) have already been trained. In practice  rather than holding all subsequent
blocks ﬁxed  it is natural to ﬁne-tune them while training block i. One approach might be ﬁne-tuning
them on the current k = 2i-shot regression task being considered at iteration i. But because Meta-
ModelNet will be applied across a wide range of k  we ﬁne-tune blocks in a multi-task manner across
the current viable range of k = (2i  2i+1  . . .   2N ) at each iteration i.

3.4

Implementation details

We learn the CNN models on the long-tailed recognition datasets in different scenarios: (1) using
a CNN pre-trained on ILSVRC 2012 [1  59  60] as the off-the-shelf feature; (2) ﬁne-tuning the
pre-trained CNN; and (3) training a CNN from scratch. We use ResNet152 [4] for its state-of-the-art
performance and use ResNet50 [4] and AlexNet [1] for their easy computation.
When training the residual block i  we use the corresponding threshold t and obtain Ct head classes.
We generate the Ct-way many-shot classiﬁers on Ht. For few-shot models  we learn Ct-way k-shot
classiﬁers on random subsets of Ht. Through random sampling  we generate S model mini-batches
and each model mini-batch consists of Ct weight vector pairs. In addition  to minimize the loss
function (1)  we randomly sample 256 image-label pairs as a data mini-batch from Ht.
We then use Caffe [59] to train our MetaModelNet on the generated model and data mini-batches
based on standard SGD. λ is cross-validated. We use 0.01 as the negative slope for leaky ReLU.
Computation is naturally divided into two stages: (1) training a collection of few/many-shot models
and (2) learning MetaModelNet from those models. (2) is equivalent to progressively learning a
nonlinear regressor. (1) can be made efﬁcient because it is naturally parallelizable across models  and
moreover  many models make use of only small training sets.

4 Experimental Evaluation

In this section  we explore the use of our MetaModelNet on long-tail recognition tasks. We begin with
extensive evaluation of our approach on scene classiﬁcation of the SUN-397 dataset [14]  and address
the meta-network variations and different design choices. We then visualize and empirically analyze
the learned model dynamics. Finally  we evaluate on the challenging large-scale  scene-centric
Places [7] and object-centric ImageNet datasets [5] and show the generality of our approach.

4.1 Evaluation and analysis on SUN-397

Dataset and task: We start our evaluation by ﬁne-tuning a pre-trained CNN on SUN-397  a medium-
scale  long-tailed dataset with 397 classes and 100–2 361 images per class [14]. To better analyze
trends due to skewed distributions  we carve out a more extreme version of the dataset. Following
the experimental setup in [61  62  63]  we ﬁrst randomly split the dataset into train  validation  and
test parts using 50%  10%  and 40% of the data  respectively. The distribution of classes is uniform
across all the three parts. We then randomly discard 49 images per class for the train part  leading
to a long-tailed training set with 1–1 132 images per class (median 47). Similarly  we generate a
small long-tailed validation set with 1–227 images per class (median 10)  which we use for learning
hyper-parameters. We also randomly sample 40 images per class for the test part  leading to a
balanced test set. We report 397-way multi-class classiﬁcation accuracy averaged over all classes.

4.1.1 Comparison with state-of-the-art approaches

We ﬁrst focus on ﬁne-tuning the classiﬁer module while freezing the representation module of a
pre-trained ResNet152 CNN model [4  63] for its state-of-the-art performance. Using MetaModelNet 
we learn the model dynamics of the classiﬁer module  i.e.  how the classiﬁer weight vectors change
during ﬁne-tuning. Following the design choices in Section 3.2  our MetaModelNet consists of 7
residual blocks. For few-shot models  we generate S = 1000 1-shot  S = 500 2-shot  and S = 200
4-shot till 64-shot models from the head classes for learning MetaModelNet. At test time  given
the weight vectors of all the classes learned through ﬁne-tuning  we feed them as inputs to the
different residual blocks according to their training sample size of the corresponding class. We then
“hallucinate” the dynamics of these weight vectors and use the outputs of MetaModelNet to modify
the parameters of the ﬁnal recognition model as in [21].
Baselines: In addition to the “plain” baseline that ﬁne-tunes on the target data following the standard
practice  we compare against three state-of-the-art baselines that are widely used to address the
imbalanced distributions. (1) Over-sampling [16  17]  which uses the balanced sampling via label
shufﬂing as in [16  17]. (2) Under-sampling [27]  which reduces the number of samples per class to
47 at most (the median value). (3) Cost-sensitive [28]  which introduces additional weights in the loss
function for each class with inverse class frequency. For a fair comparison  ﬁne-tuning is performed

representation module. By beneﬁting from the learned generic model dynamics from head classes 
ours signiﬁcantly outperforms all the baselines for the long-tail recognition.

10 around every 30 epochs. All the other hyper-parameters are the same for all approaches.
Table 1 summarizes the performance comparison averaged over all classes and Fig. 3 details the per
class comparison. Table 1 shows that our MetaModelNet provides a promising way of encoding
the shared structure across classes in model space. It outperforms existing approaches for long-tail
recognition by a large margin. Fig. 3 shows that our approach signiﬁcantly improves accuracy in the
tail.

4.1.2 Ablation analysis

We now evaluate variations of our approach and provide ablation analysis. Similar as in Section 4.1.1 
we use ResNet152 in the ﬁrst two sets of experiments and only ﬁne-tune the classiﬁer module. In the
last set of experiments  we use ResNet50 [4] for easy computation and ﬁne-tune through the entire
network. Tables 2 and 3 summarize the results.
Sample-size dependent transformation and identity regularization: We compare to [21]  which
learns a single transformation for a variety of sample sizes and k-shot models  and importantly 
learns a network without identity regularization. For a fair comparison  we consider a variant of
MetaModelNet trained on a ﬁxed head and tail split  selected by cross-validation. Table 2 shows that
training for a ﬁxed sample size and identity regularization provide a noticeable performance boost
(2%).
Recursive class splitting: Adding multiple head-tail splits through recursion further improves
accuracy by a small but noticeable amount (0.5% as shown in Table 2). We posit that progressive
knowledge transfer outperforms the traditional approach because ordering classes by frequency is a
natural form of curriculum learning.
Joint feature ﬁne-tuning and model dynamics learning: We also explore (nonlinear) ﬁne-tuning
of the “entire network” during head-to-tail transfer by jointly learning the classiﬁer dynamics and the
feature representation using ResNet50. We explore two approaches as follows. (1) We ﬁrst ﬁne-tune

entire CNN on the current head classes in Ht (while learning the many-shot parameters θ∗)  and then
learn classiﬁer dynamics using the ﬁne-tuned features. Table 3 shows that progressively learning
classiﬁer dynamics while ﬁne-tuning features performs the best.

4.2 Understanding model dynamics

Because model dynamics are highly nonlinear  a theoretical proof is rather challenging and outside
the scope of this work. Here we provide some empirical analysis of model dynamics. When analyzing
the “dual model (parameter) space”  in which models parameters θ can be viewed as points  Fig. 4
shows that our MetaModelNet learns an approximately-smooth  nonlinear warping of this space that
transforms (few-shot) input points to (many-shot) output points. For example  iceberg and mountain
scene classes are more similar to each other than to bedrooms. This implies that few-shot iceberg
and mountain scene models lie near each other in parameter space  and moreover  they transform in
similar ways (when compared to bedrooms). This single meta-network hence encodes class-speciﬁc
model transformations. We posit that the transformation may capture some form of (class-speciﬁc)
data-augmentation. Finally  we ﬁnd that some properties of the learned transformations are quite
class-agnostic and apply in generality. Many-shot model parameters tend to have larger magnitudes
and norms than few-shot ones (e.g.  on SUN-397  the average norm of 1-shot models is 0.53; after
transformations through MetaModelNet  the average norm of the output models becomes 1.36). This
is consistent with the common empirical observation that classiﬁer weights tend to grow with the
amount of training data  showing that they become more conﬁdent about their prediction.

4.3 Generalization to other tasks and datasets

We now focus on the more challenging  large-scale scene-centric Places [7] and object-centric
ImageNet [5] datasets. While we mainly addressed the model dynamics when ﬁne-tuning a pre-
trained CNN in the previous experiments  here we train AlexNet models [1] from scratch on the target
tasks. Table 4 shows the generality of our approach and shows that MetaModelNets facilitate the
recognition of other long-tailed datasets with signiﬁcantly different visual concepts and distributions.
Scene classiﬁcation on the Places dataset: Places-205 [7] is a large-scale dataset which contains
2 448 873 training images approximately evenly distributed across 205 classes. To generate its
long-tailed version and better analyze trends due to skewed distributions  we distribute it according to
the distribution of SUN and carve out a more extreme version (p2  or 2× the slope in log-log plot)
out of the Places training portion  leading to a long-tailed training set with 5–9 900 images per class
(median 73). We use the provided validation portion as our test set with 100 images per class.
Object classiﬁcation on the ImageNet dataset: The ILSVRC 2012 classiﬁcation dataset [5] con-
tains 1 000 classes with 1.2 million training images (approximately balanced between the classes)
and 50K validation images. There are 200 classes used for object detection which are deﬁned as

Figure 4: Visualizing model dynamics. Recall that θ is a ﬁxed-dimensional vector of model parameters
— e.g.  θ ∈ R2048 when considering parameters from the last layer of ResNet. We visualize models
as points in this “dual” space. Speciﬁcally  we examine the evolution of parameters predicted by
MetaModelNet with dimensionality reduction — PCA (Fig. 4a) or t-SNE [64] (Fig. 4b). 1-shot
models (purple) to many-shot models (red) are plotted in a rainbow order. These visualizations show
that MetaModelNet learns an approximately-smooth  nonlinear warping of this space that transforms
(few-shot) input points to (many-shot) output points. PCA suggests that many-shot models tend
to have larger norms  while t-SNE (which nonlinearly maps nearby points to stay close) suggests
that similar semantic classes tend to be close and transform in similar ways  e.g.  the blue rectangle
encompasses “room” classes while the red rectangle encompasses “wintry outdoor” classes.

and merging the 1 000 classes into the 200 higher-level classes  we obtain a natural long-tailed
distribution.

5 Conclusions

In this work we proposed a conceptually simple but powerful approach to address the problem of
long-tail recognition through knowledge transfer from the head to the tail of the class distribution.
Our key insight is to represent the model dynamics through meta-learning  i.e.  how a recognition
model transforms and evolves during the learning process when gradually encountering more training
examples. To do so  we introduce a meta-network that learns to progressively transfer meta-knowledge
from the head to the tail classes. We present several state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets
(SUN  Places  and Imagenet) tuned for the long-tailed setting  that signiﬁcantly outperform common
heuristics  such as data resampling or reweighting.
