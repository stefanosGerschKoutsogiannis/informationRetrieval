Abstract

Undirected graphical models  such as Gaussian graphical models  Ising  and
multinomial/categorical graphical models  are widely used in a variety of applica-
tions for modeling distributions over a large number of variables. These standard
instances  however  are ill-suited to modeling count data  which are increasingly
ubiquitous in big-data settings such as genomic sequencing data  user-ratings data 
spatial incidence data  climate studies  and site visits. Existing classes of Poisson
graphical models  which arise as the joint distributions that correspond to Pois-
son distributed node-conditional distributions  have a major drawback: they can
only model negative conditional dependencies for reasons of normalizability given
its inﬁnite domain. In this paper  our objective is to modify the Poisson graphi-
cal model distribution so that it can capture a rich dependence structure between
count-valued variables. We begin by discussing two strategies for truncating the
Poisson distribution and show that only one of these leads to a valid joint distribu-
tion. While this model can accommodate a wider range of conditional dependen-
cies  some limitations still remain. To address this  we investigate two additional
novel variants of the Poisson distribution and their corresponding joint graphical
model distributions. Our three novel approaches provide classes of Poisson-like
graphical models that can capture both positive and negative conditional depen-
dencies between count-valued variables. One can learn the graph structure of
our models via penalized neighborhood selection  and we demonstrate the perfor-
mance of our methods by learning simulated networks as well as a network from
microRNA-sequencing data.

Introduction

Undirected graphical models  or Markov random ﬁelds (MRFs)  are a popular class of statistical
models for representing distributions over a large number of variables. These models have found
wide applicability in many areas including genomics  neuroimaging  statistical physics  and spatial
statistics. Popular instances of this class of models include Gaussian graphical models [1  2  3  4] 
used for modeling continuous real-valued data  the Ising model [3  5]  used for modeling binary
data  as well as multinomial graphical models [6] where each variable takes values in a small ﬁnite
set. There has also been recent interest in non-parametric extensions of these models [7  8  9  10].
None of these models however are best suited to model count data  where the variables take values
in the set of all positive integers. Examples of such count data are increasingly ubiquitous in big-data

settings  including high-throughput genomic sequencing data  spatial incidence data  climate studies 
user-ratings data  term-document counts  site visits  and crime and disease incidence reports.
In the univariate case  a popular choice for modeling count data is the Poisson distribution. Could
we then model complex multivariate count data using some multivariate extension of the Poisson
distribution? A line of work [11] has focused on log-linear models for count data in the context of
contingency tables  however the number of parameters in these models grow exponentially with the
number of variables and hence  these are not appropriate for high-dimensional regimes with large
numbers of variables. Yet other approaches are based on indirect copula transforms [12]  as well as
multivariate Poisson distributions that do not have a closed  tractable form  and relying on limiting
results [13]. Another important approach deﬁnes a multivariate Poisson distribution by modeling
node variables as sums of independent Poisson variables [14  15]. Since the sum of independent
Poisson variables is Poisson as well  this construction yields Poisson marginal distributions. The
resulting joint distribution  however  becomes intractable to characterize with even a few variables
and moreover  can only model positive correlations  with further restrictions on the magnitude of
these correlations. Other avenues for modeling multivariate count-data include hierarchical models
commonly used in spatial statistics [16].
In a qualitatively different line of work  Besag [17] discusses a tractable and natural multivariate
extension of the univariate Poisson distribution; while this work focused on the pairwise model
case  Yang et al. [18  19] extended this to the general graphical model setting. Their construction
of a Poisson graphical model (PGM) is simple. Suppose all node-conditional distributions  the
conditional distribution of a node conditioned on the rest of the nodes  are univariate Poisson. Then 
there is a unique joint distribution consistent with these node-conditional distributions  and moreover
this joint distribution is a graphical model distribution that factors according to a graph speciﬁed
by the node-conditional distributions. While this graphical model seems like a good candidate to
model multivariate count data  there is one major defect. For the density to be normalizable  the edge
weights specifying the Poisson graphical model distribution have to be non-positive. This restriction
implies that a Poisson graphical model distribution only models negative dependencies  or so called
“competitive” relationships among variables. Thus  such a Poisson graphical model would have
limited practical applicability in modeling more general multivariate count data [20  21]  with both
positive and negative dependencies among the variables.
To address this major drawback of non-positive conditional dependencies of the Poisson MRF 
Kaiser and Cressie [20]  Grifﬁth [21] have suggested the use of the Winsorized Poisson distribu-
tion. This is the univariate distribution obtained by truncating the integer-valued Poisson random
variable at a ﬁnite constant R. Speciﬁcally  they propose the use of this Winsorized Poisson as node-
conditional distributions  and assert that there exists a consistent joint distribution by following the
construction of [17]. Interestingly  we will show that their result is incorrect and this approach can
never lead to a consistent joint distribution in the vein of [17  18  19]. Thus  there currently does not
exist a graphical model distribution for high-dimensional multivariate count data that does not suffer
from severe deﬁciencies. In this paper  our objective is to specify a joint graphical model distribution
over the set of non-negative integers that can capture rich dependence structures between variables.
The major contributions of our paper are summarized as follows: We ﬁrst consider truncated Poisson
distributions and (1) show that the approach of [20] is NOT conducive to specifying a joint graphical
model distribution; instead  (2) we propose a novel truncation approach that yields a proper MRF
distribution  the Truncated PGM (TPGM). This model however  still has certain limitations on the
types of variables and dependencies that may be modeled  and we thus consider more fundamental
modiﬁcations to the univariate Poisson density’s base measure and sufﬁcient statistics. (3) We will
show that in order to have both positive and negative conditional dependencies  the requirements
of normalizability are that the base measure of the Poisson density needs to scale quadratically for
linear sufﬁcient statistics. This leads to (4) a novel Quadratic PGM (QPGM) with linear sufﬁcient
statistics and its logical extension  (5) the Sublinear PGM (SPGM) with sub-linear sufﬁcient statis-
tics that permit sub-quadratic base measures. Our three novel approaches for the ﬁrst time specify
classes of joint graphical models for count data that permit rich dependence structures between vari-
ables. While the focus of this paper is model speciﬁcation  we also illustrate how our models can be
used to learn the network structure from iid samples of high-dimensional multivariate count data via
neighborhood selection. We conclude our work by demonstrating our models on simulated networks
and by learning a breast cancer microRNA expression network form count-valued next generation
sequencing data.

Poisson graphical models were introduced by [17] for the pairwise case  where they termed
these “Poisson auto-models”; [18  19] provide a generalization to these models. Let X =
(X1  X2  . . .   Xp) be a p-dimensional random vector where the domain X of each Xs is
{0  1  2  . . .}; and let G = (V  E) be an undirected graph over p nodes corresponding to the p
variables. The pairwise Poisson graphical model (PGM) distribution over X is then deﬁned as

(cid:26)(cid:88)
parameter λ = exp(ηs) = exp(θs +(cid:80)
tion A(θ) < +∞  where A(θ) := log(cid:80)X p exp

It can be seen that the node-conditional distributions for the above distribution are given by
P (Xs|XV \s) = exp{ηsXs − log(Xs!) − exp(ηs)}  which is a univariate Poisson distribution with
t∈N (s) θstXt)  and where N (s) is the neighborhood of node
(cid:111)

s according to graph G.
As we have noted  there is a major drawback with this Poisson graphical model distribution. Note
that the domain of parameters θ of the distribution in (1) are speciﬁed by the normalizability condi-
.
Proposition 1 (See [17]). Consider the Poisson graphical model distribution in (1). Then  for any
parameter θ  A(θ) < +∞ only if the pairwise parameters are non-positive: θst ≤ 0 for (s  t) ∈ E .
The above proposition asserts that the Poisson graphical model in (1) only allows negative edge-
weights  and consequently can only capture negative conditional relationships between variables.
Thus  even though the Poisson graphical model is a natural extension of the univariate Poisson
distribution  it entails a highly restrictive parameter space with severely limited applicability. The
objective of this paper  then  is to arrive at a graphical model for count data that would allow relaxing
these restrictive assumptions  and model both positively and negatively correlated variables.

2.1 Truncation  Winsorization  and the Poisson Distribution

The need for ﬁniteness of A(θ) imposes a negativity constraint on θ because of the countably inﬁnite
domain of the random variables. A natural approach to address this would then be to truncate the
domain of the Poisson random variables. In this section  we will investigate the two natural ways in
which to do so and discuss their possible graphical model distributions.

2.1.1 A Natural Truncation Approach

Kaiser and Cressie [20] ﬁrst introduced an approach to truncate the Poisson distribution in the con-
text of graphical models. Suppose Z(cid:48) is Poisson with parameter λ. Then  one can deﬁne what they
termed a Winsorized Poisson random variable Z as follows: Z = I(Z(cid:48) < R)Z(cid:48) + I(Z(cid:48) ≥ R)R 
where I(A) is an indicator function  and R is a ﬁxed positive constant denoting the truncation
level. The probability mass function of this truncated Poisson variable  P (Z; λ  R)  can then
be written as I(Z < R)
. Now consider
the use of this Winsorized Poisson distribution for node-conditional distributions  P (Xs|XV \s):
I(Xs < R)
  where λs = exp(ηs) =

(cid:16) λZ
(cid:17)
Z! exp(−λ)
(cid:17)

We now have the machinery to describe the development in [20] of a Winsorized Poisson graphical
model. Speciﬁcally  Kaiser and Cressie [20] assert in a Proposition of their paper that there is a valid
joint distribution consistent with these Winsorized Poisson node-conditional distributions above.
However  in the following theorem  we prove that such a joint distribution can never exist.

3

Theorem 1. Suppose X = (X1  . . .   Xp) is a p-dimensional random vector with domain
{0  1  ...  R}p where R > 3. Then there is no joint distribution over X such that the corresponding
node-conditional distributions P (Xs|XV \s)  of a node conditioned on the rest of the nodes  have

the form speciﬁed as P (Xs|XV \s) ∝ exp(cid:8)E(XV \s)Xs − log(Xs!) + I(Xs = R)Ψ(cid:0)E(XV \s)(cid:1)(cid:9) 

where E(XV \s)  the canonical exponential family parameter  can be an arbitrary function.

Theorem 1 thus shows that we cannot just substitute the Winsorized Poisson distribution in the
construction of [17  18  19] to obtain a Winsorized variant of Poisson graphical models.

2.1.2 A New Approach to Truncation

It is instructive to study the probability mass function of the univariate Winsorized Poisson distribu-
tion in (2). The “remnant” probability mass of the Poisson distribution for the cases where X > R 
was all moved to X = R. In the process  it is no longer an exponential family  a property that is
crucial for compatibility with the construction in [17  18  19]. Could we then derive a truncated
Poisson distribution that still belongs to the exponential family? It can be seen that the follow-
ing distribution over a truncated Poisson variable Z ∈ X = {0  1  . . .   R} ﬁts the bill perfectly:
(cid:80)
exp{θZ−log(Z!)}
k∈X exp{θk−log(k!)}. The random variable Z here is another natural truncated Poisson
P (Z) =
variant  where the “remnant” probability mass for the cases where X > R was distributed to all the
remaining events X ≤ R. It can be seen that this distribution also belongs to the exponential family.
A natural strategy would then be to use this distribution as the node-conditional distributions in the
construction of [17  18]:

(3)

Theorem 2. Suppose X = (X1  X2  . . .   Xp) be a p-dimensional random vector  where each vari-
able Xs for s ∈ V takes values in the truncated positive integer set  {0  1  ...  R}  where R is a ﬁxed
positive constant. Suppose its node-conditional distributions are speciﬁed as in (3)  where the node-
neighborhoods are as speciﬁed by a graph G. Then  there exists a unique joint distribution that is
consistent with these node-conditional distributions  and moreover this distribution belongs to the
s∈V (θsXs − log(Xs!)) +

graphical model represented by G  with the form: P (X) := exp(cid:8)(cid:80)
(s t)∈E θst Xs Xt − A(θ)(cid:9)  where A(θ) is the normalization constant.
(cid:80)

We call this distribution the Truncated Poisson graphical model (TPGM) distribution. Note that it is
distinct from the original Poisson distribution (1); in particular its normalization constant involves
a summation over ﬁnitely many terms. Thus  no restrictions are imposed on the parameters for the
normalizability of the distribution. Unlike the original Poisson graphical model  the TPGM can
model both positive and negative dependencies among its variables.
There are  however  some drawbacks to this graphical model distribution. First  the domain of the
variables is bounded a priori by the distribution speciﬁcation  so that it is not broadly applicable
to arbitrary  and possibly inﬁnite  count-valued data. Second  problems arise when the random
variables take on large count values close to R. In particular by examining (3)  one can see that
when Xt is large  the mass over Xs values get pushed towards R; thus  this truncated version is not
always close to that of the original Poisson density. Therefore  as the truncation value R increases 
the possible values that the parameters θ can take become increasingly negative or close to zero to
prevent all random variables from always taking large count values at the same time. This can be
seen as if we take R → ∞  we arrive at the original PGM and negativity constraints. In summary 
the TPGM approach offers some trade-offs between the value of R  it more closely follows the
Poisson density when R is large  and the types of dependencies permitted.

3 A New Class of Poisson Variants and Their Graphical Model Distributions

As discussed in the previous section  taking a Poisson random variable and truncating it may be a
natural approach but does not lead to a valid multivariate graphical model extension  or does so with
some caveats. Accordingly in this section  we investigate the possibility of modifying the Poisson
distribution more fundamentally  by modifying its sufﬁcient statistic and base measure.

4

Let us ﬁrst brieﬂy review the derivation of a Poisson graphical model as the graphical model exten-
sion of a univariate exponential family distribution from [17  18  19]. Consider a general univariate
exponential family distribution  for a random variable Z: P (Z) = exp(θB(Z) − C(Z) − D(θ)) 
where B(Z) is the exponential family sufﬁcient statistic  θ ∈ R is the parameter  C(Z) is the base
measure  and D(θ) is the log-partition function. Suppose the node-conditional distributions are all
speciﬁed by the above exponential family 

P (Xs|XV \s) = exp{E(XV \s) B(Xs) + C(Xs) − ¯D(XV \s)} 

bution takes the following form: P (X) = exp(cid:8)(cid:80)
s∈V C(Xs) − A(θ)(cid:9). Note that although the log partition function A(θ) is usually computa-
(cid:80)

(4)
where the canonical parameter of exponential family is some function E(·) on the rest of the vari-
ables XV \s (and hence so is the log-normalization constant ¯D(·)). Further  suppose the correspond-
ing joint distribution factors according to the graph G  with the factors over cliques of size at most
k. Then  Proposition 2 in [18]  shows that there exists a unique joint distribution corresponding to
the node-conditional distributions in (4). With clique factors of size k at most two  this joint distri-
(s t)∈E θst B(Xs)B(Xt) −
tionally intractable  the log-partition function ¯D(·) of its node-conditional distribution (4) is still
tractable  which allows consistent graph structure recovery [18]. Also note that the original Pois-
son graphical model (1) discussed in Section 2 can be derived from this construction with sufﬁcient
statistics B(X) = X  and base measure C(X) = log(X!).

s∈V θsB(Xs) +(cid:80)

3.1 A Quadratic Poisson Graphical Model

that a key driver of the result is that the base measure terms (cid:80)

As noted in Proposition 1  the normalizability of this Poisson graphical model distribution  however 
requires that the pairwise parameters be negative. A closer look at the proof of Proposition 1 shows
s∈V log(Xs!)
scale more slowly than the quadratic pairwise terms XsXt. Accordingly  we consider the following
general distribution over count-valued variables:

s∈V C(Xs) = (cid:80)

P (Z) = exp(θZ − C(Z) − D(θ)) 

(5)
which has the same sufﬁcient statistics as the Poisson  but a more general base measure C(Z) 
for some function C(·). The following theorem shows that for normalizability of the resulting
graphical model distribution with possibly positive edge-parameters  the base measure cannot be
sub-quadratic:
Theorem 3. Suppose X = (X1  . . .   Xp) is a count-valued random vector  with joint distribution
given by the graphical model extension of the univariate distribution in (5) which follows the con-
struction of [17  18  19]). Then  if the distribution is normalizable so that A(θ) < ∞ for θ (cid:54)≤ 0  it
necessarily holds that C(Z) = Ω(Z 2).

The previous theorem thus suggests using the “Gaussian-esque” quadratic base measure C(Z) =
Z 2  so that we would obtain the following distribution over count-valued vectors  P (X) =

s − A(θ)(cid:9). for some ﬁxed positive constant

(6)

We call this distribution the Quadratic Poisson Graphical Model (QPGM). The following proposition
shows that the QPGM is normalizable while permitting both positive and negative edge-parameters.
Proposition 2. Consider the distribution in (6). Suppose we collate the quadratic term parameters
into a p× p matrix Θ. Then the distribution is normalizable provided the following condition holds:
There exists a positive constant cθ  such that for all X ∈ Wp  X T ΘX ≤ −cθ(cid:107)X(cid:107)2
2.
The condition in the proposition would be satisﬁed provided that the pairwise parameters are point-
wise negative: Θ < 0  similar to the original Poisson graphical model. Alternatively  it is also
sufﬁcient for the pairwise parameter matrix to be negative-deﬁnite: Θ ≺ 0  which does allow for
positive and negative dependencies  as in the Gaussian distribution.
A possible drawback with this distribution is that due to the quadratic base measure  the QPGM
has a Gaussian-esque thin tail. Even though the domains of Gaussian and QPGM are distinct 

5

their densities have similar behaviors and shapes as long as θs +(cid:80)

Indeed 
the Gaussian log-partition function serves as a variational upper bound for the QPGM. Speciﬁcally 
under the restriction that θss < 0  we arrive at the following upper bound:

D(θ; XV \s) = log

exp(cid:8)ηsXs + θssX 2

by relating to the log-partition function of a node-conditional Gaussian distribution. Thus  node-
wise regressions according to the QPGM via the above variational upper bound on the partition
function would behave similarly to that of a Gaussian graphical model.

3.2 A Sub-Linear Poisson Graphical Model

From the previous section  we have learned that so long as we have linear sufﬁcient statistics 
B(X) = X  we must have a base measure that scales at least quadratically  C(Z) = Ω(Z 2) 
for a Poisson-based graphical model (i) to permit both positive and negative conditional depen-
dencies and (ii) to ensure normalizability. Such a quadratic base measure however results in a
Gaussian-esque thin tail  while we would like to specify a distribution with possibly heavier tails
than those of QPGM. It thus follows that we would need to control the linear Poisson sufﬁcient
statistics B(X) = X itself. Accordingly  we consider the following univariate distribution over
count-valued variables:

P (Z) = exp(θB(Z; R0  R) − log Z! − D(θ  R0  R)) 

(7)
which has the same base measure C(Z) = log Z! as the Poisson  but with the following sub-linear
sufﬁcient statistics:

B(x; R0  R) =

2(R−R0) x2 + R

x − R2

2(R−R0)

0

 x

− 1

if x ≤ R0
if R0 < x ≤ R
if x ≥ R

We depict this sublinear statistic in Figure 3 in the appendix; Up to R0  B(x) increases linearly 
however  after R0 its slope decreases linearly and becomes zero at R.
The following theorem shows the normalizability of the SPGM:
Theorem 4. Suppose X = (X1  . . .   Xp) is a count-valued random vector  with joint distribution
given by the graphical model extension of the univariate distribution in (7) (following the construc-
tion [17  18  19]):

(s t)∈E

(cid:26)(cid:88)

s∈V

This distribution is normalizable  so that A(θ) < ∞ for all pairwise parameters θst ∈ R; (s  t) ∈ E.
On comparing with the QPGM  the SPGM has two distinct advantages: (1) it has a heavier tails
with milder base measures as seen in its motivation  and (2) allows a broader set of feasible pairwise
parameters (actually for all real values) as shown in Theorem 4.
The log-partition function D(θ  R0  R) of node-conditional SPGM involves the summation over in-
ﬁnite terms  and hence usually does not have a closed-form. The log-partition function of traditional
univariate Poisson distribution  however  can serve as a variational upper bound:
Proposition 3. Consider the node-wise conditional distributions in (7). If θ ≥ 0  we obtain the
following upper bound:

D(θ  R0  R) ≤ DPois(θ) = exp(θ).

4 Numerical Experiments

While the focus of this paper is model speciﬁcation  we can learn our models from iid samples of
count-valued multivariate vectors using neighborhood selection approaches as suggested in [1  5

TPGM distribution or by [15] (sums of independent Poissons method) for both standard and high-

QPGM and SPGM models using proximal gradient ascent. Also  as our models are constructed in
the framework of [18  19]  we expect extensions of their sparsistency analysis to conﬁrm that the
network structure of our model can indeed be learned from iid data; due to space limitations  this is
left for future work.
Simulation Studies. We evaluate the comparative performance of our TPGM and SPGM methods
for recovering the true network from multivariate count data. Data of dimension n = 200 samples
and p = 50 variables or the high-dimensional regime of n = 50 samples and p = 100 variables
is generated via the TPGM distribution using Gibbs sampling or via the sums of independent Pois-
sons method of [15]. For the former  edges were generated with both positive and negative weights 
while for the latter  only edges with positive weights can be generated. As we expect the SPGM to be
sparsistent for data generated from the SGPM distribution following the work of [18  19]  we have
chosen to present results for data generated from other models. Two network structures are con-
sidered that are commonly used throughout genomics: the hub and scale-free graph structures. We
compare the performance of our TPGM and SPGM methods with R set to the maximum count value
to Gaussian graphical models [4]  the non-paranormal [7]  and the non-paranormal SKEPTIC [10].
In Figure 1  ROC curves computed by varying the regularization parameter  and averaged over 50
replicates are presented for each scenario. Both TPGM and SPGM have superior performance for
count-valued data than Gaussian based methods. As expected  the TPGM method has the best results
when data is generated according to its distribution. Additionally  TPGM shows some advantages in
high-dimensional settings. This likely results from a facet of its node-conditional distribution which
places larger mass on strongly dependent count values that are close to R. Thus  the TPGM method
may be better able to infer edges from highly connected networks  such as those considered. Addi-
tionally  all methods compared outperform the original Poisson graphical model estimator  given in
[18] (results not shown)  as this method can only recover edges with negative weights.
Case Study: Breast Cancer microRNA Networks. We demonstrate the advantages of our graph-
ical models for count-valued data by learning a microRNA (miRNA) expression network from next
generation sequencing data. This data consists of counts of sequencing reads mapped back to a
reference genome and are replacing microarrays  for which GGMs are a popular tool  as the pre-
ferred measures of gene expression [22]. Level III data was obtained from the Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) [23] and processed according to techniques described in [24]; this data consists of
n = 544 subjects and p = 262 miRNAs. Note that [18  24] used this same data set to demonstrate

network approaches for count-data  and thus  we use the same data set so that the results of our novel
methods may be compared to those of existing approaches.
Networks were learned from this data using the original Poisson graphical model  Gaussian graph-
ical models  our novel TPGM approach with R = 11  the maximum count  and our novel SPGM
approach with R = 11 and R0 = 5. Stability selection [25] was used to estimate the sparsity of the
networks in a data-driven manner. Figure 2 depicts the inferred networks for our TPGM and SPGM
methods as well as comparative adjacency matrices to illustrate the differences between our SPGM
method and other approaches. Notice that SPGM and TPGM ﬁnd similar network structures  but
TPGM seems to ﬁnd more hub miRNAs. This is consistent with the behavior of the TPGM distribu-
tion when strongly correlated counts have values close to R. The original Poisson graphical model 
on the other hand  misses much of the structure learned by the other methods and instead only
ﬁnds 14 miRNAs that have major conditionally negative relationships. As most miRNAs work in
groups to regulate gene expression  this result is expected and illustrates a fundamental ﬂaw of the
PGM approach. Compared with Gaussian graphical models  our novel methods for count-valued
data ﬁnd many more edges and biologically important hub miRNAs. Two of these  mir-375 and
mir-10b  found by both TPGM and SPGM but not by GGM  are known to be key players in breast
cancer [26  27]. Additionally  our TPGM and SPGM methods ﬁnd a major clique which consists
of miRNAs on chromosome 19  indicating that this miRNA cluster may by functionally associated
with breast cancer.
