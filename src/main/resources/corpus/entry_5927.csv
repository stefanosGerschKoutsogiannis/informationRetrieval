Abstract

Analysis of efﬁciency of outcomes in game theoretic settings has been a main item
of study at the intersection of economics and computer science. The notion of
the price of anarchy takes a worst-case stance to efﬁciency analysis  considering
instance independent guarantees of efﬁciency. We propose a data-dependent analog
of the price of anarchy that reﬁnes this worst-case assuming access to samples of
strategic behavior. We focus on auction settings  where the latter is non-trivial
due to the private information held by participants. Our approach to bounding the
efﬁciency from data is robust to statistical errors and mis-speciﬁcation. Unlike
traditional econometrics  which seek to learn the private information of players
from observed behavior and then analyze properties of the outcome  we directly
quantify the inefﬁciency without going through the private information. We apply
our approach to datasets from a sponsored search auction system and ﬁnd empirical
results that are a signiﬁcant improvement over bounds from worst-case analysis.

Introduction

A major ﬁeld at the intersection of economics and computer science is the analysis of the efﬁciency of
systems under strategic behavior. The seminal work of [6  11] triggered a line of work on quantifying
the inefﬁciency of computer systems  ranging from network routing  resource allocation and more
recently auction marketplaces [10]. However  the notion of the price of anarchy suffers from the
pessimism of worst-case analysis. Many systems can be inefﬁcient in the worst-case over parameters
of the model  but might perform very well for the parameters that arise in practice.
Due to the large availability of datasets in modern economic systems  we propose a data-dependent
analog of the price of anarchy  which assumes access to a sample of strategic behavior from the
system. We focus our analysis on auction systems where the latter approach is more interesting due
to the private information held by the participants of the system  i.e. their private value for the item at
sale. Since efﬁciency is a function of these private parameters  quantifying the inefﬁciency of the
system from samples of strategic behavior is non-trivial. The problem of estimation of the inefﬁciency
becomes an econometric problem where we want to estimate a function of hidden variables from
observed strategic behavior. The latter is feasible under the assumption that the observed behavior
is the outcome of an equilibrium of the strategic setting  which connects observed behavior to
unobserved private information.
Traditional econometric approaches to auctions [3  8]  address such questions by attempting to
exactly pin-point the private parameters from the observed behavior and subsequently measuring the
quantities of interest  such as the efﬁciency of the allocation. The latter approach is problematic in
complex auction systems for two main reasons: (i) it leads to statistical inefﬁciency  (ii) it requires
strong conditions on the connection between observed behavior and private information. Even for a
single-item ﬁrst-price auction  uniform estimation of the private value of a player from T samples
of observed bids  can only be achieved at O(T 1/3)-rates [3]. Moreover  uniquely identifying the
private information from the observed behavior  requires a one-to-one mapping between the two

quantities. The latter requires strong assumptions on the distribution of private parameters and can
only be applied to simple auction rules.
Our approach bridges the gap between worst-case price of anarchy analysis and statistically and
modeling-wise brittle econometric analysis. We provide a data-dependent analog of recent techniques
for quantifying the worst-case inefﬁciency in auctions [13  4  10]  that do not require characterization
of the equilibrium structure and which directly quantify the inefﬁciency through best-response
arguments  without the need to pin-point the private information. Our approach makes minimal
assumptions on the distribution of private parameters and on the auction rule and achieves ˜O(
T )-
rates of convergence for many auctions used in practice  such as the Generalized Second Price (GSP)
auction [2  14]. We applied our approach to a real world dataset from a sponsored search auction
system and we portray the optimism of the data-dependent guarantees as compared to their worst-case
counterparts [1].

2 Preliminaries

We consider the single-dimensional mechanism design setting with n bidders. The mechanism
designer wants to allocate a unit of good to the bidders  subject to some feasibility constraint on
the vector of allocations (x1  . . .   xn). Let X be the space of feasible allocations. Each bidder i has
a private value vi ∈ [0  H] per-unit of the good  and her utility when she gets allocation xi and is
asked to make a payment pi is vi · xi − pi. The value of each bidder is drawn independently from
distribution with CDF Fi  supported in Vi ⊆ R+ and let F = ×i Fi be the joint distribution.
An auction A solicits a bid bi ∈ B from each bidder i and decides on the allocation vector based on
an allocation rule X : Bn → X and a payment rule p : Bn → Rn. For a vector of values and bids 
the utility of a bidder is:
(1)
A strategy σi : Vi → B  for each bidder i  maps the value of the bidder to a bid. Given an auction A
and distribution of values F  a strategy proﬁle σ is a Bayes-Nash Equilibrium (BNE) if each bidder
i with any value vi ∈ Vi maximizes her utility in expectation over her opponents bids  by bidding
σi(vi).
The welfare of an auction outcome is the expected utility generated for all the bidders  plus the
revenue of the auctioneer  which due to the form of bidder utilities boils down to being the total value
that the bidders get from the allocation. Thus the expected utility of a strategy proﬁle σ is

Ui(b; vi) = vi · Xi(b) − Pi(b).

Worst-case Bayes-Nash price of anarchy. The Bayesian price of anarchy of an auction is deﬁned
as the worst-case ratio of welfare in the optimal auction to the welfare in a Bayes-Nash equilibrium
of the original auction  taken over all value distributions and over all equilibria. Let BN E(A  F) be
the set of Bayes-Nash equilibria of an auction A  when values are drawn from distributions F. Then:

3 Distributional Price of Anarchy: Reﬁning the POA with Data
We will assume that we observe T samples b1:T = {b1  . . .   bT} of bid proﬁles from running T
times an auction A. Each bid proﬁle bt is drawn i.i.d. based on an unknown Bayes-Nash equilibrium
σ of the auction  i.e.: let D denote the distribution of the random variable σ(v)  when v is drawn
from F. Then bt are i.i.d. samples from D. Our goal is to reﬁne our prediction on the efﬁciency of the
auction and compute a bound on the price of anarchy of the auction conditional on the observed data
set. More formally  we want to derive statements of the form: conditional on b1:T   with probability
at least 1 − δ: WELFARE(σ; F) ≥ 1
ˆρ OPT(F)  where ˆρ is the empirical analogue of the worst-case
price of anarchy ratio.

Inﬁnite data limit We will tackle this question in two steps  as is standard in estimation theory.
First we will look at the inﬁnite data limit where we know the actual distribution of equilibrium bids
D. We deﬁne a notion of price of anarchy that is tailored to an equilibrium bid distribution  which we
refer to as the distributional price of anarchy. In Section 4 we give a distribution-dependent upper
bound on this ratio for any single-dimensional auction. Subsequently  in Section 5  we show how one
can estimate this upper bound on the distributional price of anarchy from samples.
Given a value distribution F and an equilibrium σ  let D(F  σ) denote the resulting equilibrium bid
distribution. We then deﬁne the distributional price of anarchy as follows:
Deﬁnition 1 (Distributional Price of Anarchy). The distributional price of anarchy DPOA(D) of
an auction A and a distribution of bid proﬁles D  is the worst-case ratio of welfare in the optimal
allocation to the welfare in an equilibrium  taken over all distributions of values and all equilibria
that could generate the bid distribution D:

DPOA(D) =

sup

F σ∈BN E(F) s.t. D(F σ)=D

OPT(F)

WELFARE(σ; F)

(4)

This notion has nothing to do with sampled data-sets  but rather is a hypothetical worst-case quantity
that we could calculate had we known the true bid generating distribution D.
What does the extra information of knowing D give us? To answer this question  we ﬁrst focus
on the optimization problem each bidder faces. At any Bayes-Nash equilibrium each player must
be best-responding in expectation over his opponent bids. Observe that if we know the rules of the
auction and the equilibrium distribution of bids D  then the expected allocation and payment function
of a player as a function of his bid are uniquely determined:

xi(b;D) = Eb−i∼D−i [Xi(b  b−i)]

(5)
Importantly  these functions do not depend on the distribution of values F  other than through the
distribution of bids D. Moreover  the expected revenue of the auction is also uniquely determined:

pi(b;D) = Eb−i∼D−i [Pi(b  b−i)] .

(cid:34)(cid:88)

(cid:35)

REV(D) = Eb∼D

i

Thus when bounding the distributional price of anarchy  we can assume that these functions and
the expected revenue are known. The latter is unlike the standard price of anarchy analysis  which
essentially needs to take a worst-case approach to these quantities.
Shorthand notation Through the rest of the paper we will ﬁx the distribution D. Hence  for brevity
we omit it from notation  using xi(b)  pi(b) and REV instead of xi(b;D)  pi(b;D) and REV(D).

4 Bounding the Distributional Price of Anarchy

We ﬁrst upper bound the distributional price of anarchy via a quantity that is relatively easy to
calculate as a function of the bid distribution D and hence will also be rather straightforward to
estimate from samples of D  which we defer to the next section. To give intuition about the upper
bound  we start with a simple but relevant example of bounding the distributional price of anarchy in
the case when the auction A is the single-item ﬁrst price auction. We then generalize the approach to
any auction A.

4.1 Example: Single-Item First Price Auction

In a single item ﬁrst price auction  the designer wants to auction a single indivisible good. Thus
the space of feasible allocations X   are ones where only one player gets allocation xi = 1 and
other players get allocation 0. The auctioneer solicits bids bi from each bidder and allocates the
good to the highest bidder (breaking ties lexicographically)  charging him his bid. Let D be the
equilibrium distribution of bids and let Gi be the CDF of the bid of player i. For simplicity we
assume that Gi is continuous (i.e. the distribution is atomless). Then the expected allocation of a
j(cid:54)=i Gj(b) and his expected payment
is pi(b) = b · xi(b)  leading to expected utility: ui(b; vi) = (vi − b)G−i(b).

player i from submitting a bid b is equal to xi(b) = G−i(b) =(cid:81)

The quantity DPOA is a complex object as it involves the structure of the set of equilibria of the given
auction. The set of equilibria of a ﬁrst price auction when bidders values are drawn from different
distributions is an horriﬁc object.1 However  we can upper bound this quantity by a much simpler
data-dependent quantity by simply invoking the fact that under any equilibrium bid distribution no
player wants to deviate from his equilibrium bid. Moreover  this data-dependent quantity can be
much better than its worst-case counterpart used in the existing literature on the price of anarchy.

bids  then DPOA(D) ≤ µ(D)

Eb∼D[maxi∈[n] bi]

Proof. Let Gi be the CDF of the bid of each player under distribution D. Moreover  let σ denote the
equilibrium strategy that leads to distribution D. By the equilibrium condition  we know that for all
vi ∈ Vi and for all b(cid:48) ∈ B 

ui(σi(vi); vi) ≥ ui(b(cid:48); vi) = (vi − b(cid:48)) · G−i(b(cid:48)).

expected maximum other bid which can be expressed as Ti =(cid:82) ∞

We will give a special deviating strategy used in the literature [13]  that will show that either the
players equilibrium utility is large or the expected maximum other bid is high. Let Ti denote the
0 1 − G−i(z)dz. We consider the
randomized deviation where the player submits a randomized bid in z ∈ [0  vi(1 − e−µ)] with PDF

f (z) =

µ(vi−z). Then the expected utility from this deviation is:

Comparison with worst-case POA In the worst-case  µ(D) is upper bounded by 1  leading to the
well-known worst-case price of anarchy ratio of the single-item ﬁrst price auction of (1 − 1/e)−1 
irrespective of the bid distribution D. However  if we know the distribution D then we can explicitly
estimate µ  which can lead to a much better ratio (see Figure 1). Moreover  observe that even if
we had samples from the bid distribution D  then estimating µ(D) is very easy as it corresponds
to the ratio of two expectations  each of which can be estimating to within an O( 1√
) error by a
simple average and using standard concentration inequalities. Even thought this improvement  when
compared to the worst-case bound might not be that drastic in the ﬁrst price auction  the extension of
the analysis in the next section will be applicable even to auctions where the analogue of the quantity
µ(D) is not even bounded in the worst-case. In those settings  the empirical version of the price of
anarchy analysis is of crucial importance to get any efﬁciency bound.

1Even for two bidders with uniformly distributed values U [0  a] and U [0  b]  the equilibrium strategy requires
solving a complex system of partial differential equations  which took several years of research in economics to
solve (see [15  7])

know the bid distribution D we can calculate the equilibrium welfare as Eb∼D [(cid:80)

Comparison with value inversion approach Apart from being just a primer to our main general
result in the next section  the latter result about the data-dependent efﬁciency bound for the ﬁrst price
auction  is itself a contribution to the literature. It is notable to compare the latter result with the
standard econometric approach to estimating values in a ﬁrst price auction pioneered by [3] (see also
[8]). Traditional non-parametric auction econometrics use the equilibrium best response condition
to pin-point the value of a player from his observed bid  by what is known as value inversion. In
particular  if the function: ui(b(cid:48); vi) = (vi − b(cid:48)) · G−i(b(cid:48)) has a unique maximum for each vi and
this maximum is strictly monotone in vi  then given the equilibrium bid of a player bi and given a
data distribution D we can reverse engineer the value vi(bi) that the player must have. Thus if we
i vi(bi) · Xi(b)].
Moreover  we can calculate the expected optimal welfare as: Eb∼D [maxi vi(bi)]. Thus we can
pin-point the distributional price of anarchy.
However  the latter approach suffers from two main drawbacks: (i) estimating the value inversion
function vi(·) uniformly over b from samples  can only happen at very slow rates that are at least
O(1/T 1/3) and which require differentiability assumptions from the value and bid distribution as
well as strong conditions that the density of the value distribution is bounded away from zero in all the
support (with this lower bound constant entering the rates of convergence)  (ii) the main assumption
of the latter approach is that the optimal bid is an invertible function and that given a bid there is
a single value that corresponds to that bid. This assumption might be slightly benign in a single
item ﬁrst price auction  but becomes a harsher assumption when one goes to more complex auction
schemes. Our result in Lemma 1 suffers neither of these drawbacks: it admits fast estimation rates
from samples  makes no assumption on properties of the value and bid distribution and does not
require invertibility of the best-response correspondence. Hence it provides an upper bound on the
distributional price of anarchy that is statistically robust to both sampling and mis-speciﬁcation errors.
The robustness of our approach comes with the trade-off that we are now only estimating a bound on
the efﬁciency of the outcome  rather than exactly pinpointing it.

4.2 Generalizing to any Single-Dimensional Auction Setting

Our analysis on DPOA is based on the reformulation of the auction rules as an equivalent pay-your-
bid auction and then bounding the price of anarchy as a function of the ratio of how much a player
needs to pay in an equivalent pay-your-bid auction  so as to acquire his optimal allocation vs. how
much revenue is the auctioneer collecting. For any auction  we can re-write the expected utility of a
bid b:

(11)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

ui(b; vi) = xi(b)

vi − pi(b)
xi(b)

This can be viewed as the same form of utility if the auction was a pay-your-bid auction and the player
submitted a bid of pi(b)
xi(b). We refer to this term as the price-per-unit and denote it ppu(b) = pi(b)
xi(b).
Our analysis will be based on the price-per-unit allocation rule ˜x(·)  which determines the expected
allocation of a player as a function of his price-per-unit. Given this notation  we can re-write
the utility that an agent achieves if he submits a bid that corresponds to a price-per-unit of z as:
˜ui(z; vi) = ˜x(z)(vi − z). The latter is exactly the form of a pay-your-bid auction.
Our upper bound on the DPOA  will be based on the inverse of the PPU allocation rule; let τi(z) =
˜x−1
(z) be the price-per-unit of the cheapest bid that achieves allocation at least z. More formally 

i

5

τi(z) = minb|xi(b)≥z{ppu(b)}. For simplicity  we assume that any allocation z ∈ [0  1] is achieveable
by some high enough bid b.2 Given this we can deﬁne the threshold for an allocation:
Deﬁnition 2 (Average Threshold). The average threshold for agent i is

In Figures 3 and 2 we provide a pictorial representation of these quantities. Connecting with the
previous section  for a ﬁrst price auction  the price-per-unit function is ppu(b) = b  the price-per-unit
allocation function is ˜xi(b) = G−i(b) and the threshold function is τi(z) = G−1−i (z). The average

We now give our main theorem  which is a distribution-dependent bound on DPOA  that is easy
to compute give D and which can be easily estimated from samples of D. This theorem is a
generalization of Lemma 1 in the previous section.
Theorem 2 (Distributional Price of Anarchy Bound). For any auction A in a single dimensional
setting and for any bid distribution D  the distributional price of anarchy is bounded by DPOA(D) ≤

Theorem 2 provides our main method for bounding the distributional price of anarchy. All we need is
to compute the revenue REV of the auction and the quantity:

(13)
under the given bid distribution D. Both of these are uniquely deﬁned quantities if we are given
D. Moreover  once we compute Ti  the optimization problem in Equation (13) is simply a welfare
maximization problem  where each player’s value per-unit of the good is Ti. Thus  the latter can be
solved in polynomial time  whenever the welfare maximization problem over the feasible set X is
polynomial-time solvable.
Theorem 2 can be viewed as a bid distribution-dependent analogue of the revenue covering framework
[4] and of the smooth mechanism framework [13]. In particular  the quantity µ(D) is the data-
depenent analogue of the worst-case µ quantity used in the deﬁnition of µ-revenue covering in [4]
and is roughly related to the µ quantity used in the deﬁnition of a (λ  µ)-smooth mechanism in [13].

5 Distributional Price of Anarchy Bound from Samples
In the last section  we assumed we were given distribution D and hence we could compute the
REV   which gave an upper bound on the DPOA. We now show how we can estimate this
quantity µ = T
2The theory can be easily extended to allow for different maximum achievable allocations by each player  by

simply integrating the average threshold only up until the largest such allocation.

quantity µ when given access to i.i.d. samples b1:T from the bid distribution D. We will separately
estimate T and REV. The latter is simple expectation and thereby can be easily estimated by an
average at
rates. For the former we ﬁrst need to estimate Ti for each player i  which requires
estimation of the allocation and payment functions xi(·;D) and pi(·;D).
Since both of these functions are expected values over the equilibrium bids of opponents  we will
approximate them by their empirical analogues:

(14)

To bound the estimation error of the quantities ˆTi produced by using the latter empirical estimates of
the allocation and payment function  we need to provide a uniform convergence property for the error
of these functions over the bid b.
Since b takes values in a continuous interval  we cannot simply apply a union bound. We need
to make assumptions on the structure of the class of functions FXi = {Xi(b ·) : b ∈ B} and
FPi = {Pi(b ·) : b ∈ B}  so as uniformly bound their estimation error. For this we resort to the
technology of Rademacher complexity. For a generic class of functions F and a sequence of random
variables Z 1:T   the Rademacher complexity is deﬁned as:

(15)

where each σt ∈ {±1/2} is an i.i.d. Rademacher random variable  which takes each of those values
with equal probabilities. The following well known theorem will be useful in our derivations:
Theorem 3 ([12]). Suppose that for any sample Z 1:T of size T   RT (F  Z 1:T ) ≤ RT and suppose
that functions in F take values in [0  H]. Then with probability 1 − δ:

(16)

This Theorem reduces our uniform error problem to bounding the Rademacher complexity of classes
FXi and FPi  since we immediately have the following corollary (where we also use that the
allocation functions lie in [0  1] and the payment functions lie in [0  H]):
|(cid:98)pi(b)−pi(b)|
Corollary 4. Suppose that for any sample b1:T of size T   the Rademacher complexity of classes FXi

We now provide conditions under which the Rademacher complexity of these classes is ˜O(1/
T ).
Lemma 5. Suppose that B = [0  B] and for each bidder i and each bi ∈ B  the functions Xi(bi ·) :
[0  B]n−1 (cid:55)→ [0  1] and Pi(b ·) : [0  B]n−1 (cid:55)→ [0  H] can be computed as ﬁnite superposition of (i)
coordinate-wise multiplication of bid vectors b−i with constants; (ii) comparison indicators 1{· > ·}
of coordinates or constants; (iii) pairwise addition · +· of coordinates or constants. The Rademacher
complexity for both classes on a sample of size T is O

(cid:16)(cid:112)log(T ) / T

(cid:17)

.

√

The proof of this Lemma follows by standard arguments of Rademacher calculus  together with VC
arguments on the class of pairwise comparisons. Those arguments can be found in [5  Lemma 9.9]
and [9  Lemma 11.6.28]. Thereby  we omit its proof. The assumptions of Lemma 5 can be directly
veriﬁed  for instance  for the sponsored search auctions where the constants that multiply each bid
correspond to quality factors of the bidders  e.g. as in [2] and [14] and then the allocation and the
payment is a function of the rank of the weighted bid of a player. In that case the price and the
allocation rule are determined solely by the ranks and the values of the score-weighted bids γibi  as
well as the position speciﬁc quality factors αj  for each position j in the auction.
Next we turn to the analysis of the estimation errors on quantities Ti. We consider the following plug-

To bound the estimation error of (cid:98)Ti  we need to impose an additional condition that ensures that any

non-zero allocation requires the payment from the bidder at least proportional to that allocation.
Assumption 6. We assume that pi(x−1

6 Sponsored Search Auction: Model  Methodology and Data Analysis

(cid:80)

We consider a position auction setting where k ordered positions are assigned to n bidders. An
outcome m in a position auction is an allocation of positions to bidders. m(j) denotes the bidder who
is allocated position j; m−1(i) refers to the position assigned to bidder i. When bidder i is assigned to
slot j  the probability of click ci j is the product of the click-through-rate of the slot αj and the quality
score of the bidder  γi  so ci j = αjγi (in the data the quality scores for each bidder are varying across
different auctions and we used the average score as a proxy for the score of a bidder). Each advertiser
has a value-per-click (VPC) vi  which is not observed in the data and which we assume is drawn from
some distribution Fi. Our benchmark for welfare will be the welfare of the auction that chooses a
feasible allocation to maximize the welfare generated  thus OPT = Ev[maxm
We consider data generated by advertisers repeatedly participating in a sponsored search auction. The
mechanism that is being repeated at each stage is an instance of a generalized second price auction
triggered by a search query. The rules of each auction are as follows: Each advertiser i is associated
with a click probability γi and a scoring coefﬁcient si and is asked to submit a bid-per-click bi.
Advertisers are ranked by their rank-score qi = si · bi and allocated positions in decreasing order
of rank-score as long as they pass a rank-score reserve r. All the mentioned sets of parameters
θ = (s  α  γ  r) and the bids b are observable in the data.
We will denote with πb θ(j) the bidder allocated in slot j under a bid proﬁle b and parameter proﬁle
θ. We denote with π−1
b θ(i) the slot allocated to bidder i. If advertiser i is allocated position j 
then he pays only when he is clicked and his payment  i.e. his cost-per-click is the minimal bid
he had to place to keep his position  which is: cpcij(b; θ) =
this setting to our general model  the allocation function of the auction is Xi(b) = απ

Data Analysis We applied our analysis to the BingAds sponsored search auction system. We
analyzed eleven phrases from multiple thematic categories. For each phrase we retrieved data of
auctions for the phrase for the period of a week. For each phrase and bidder that participated in the
auctions for the phrase we computed the allocation curve by simulating the auctions for the week
under any alternative bid an advertiser could submit (bids are multiples of cents).
See Figure 4 for the price-per-unit allocation curves ˜xi(·) = τ−1
(·) for a subset of the advertisers
for a speciﬁc search phrase. We estimated the average threshold ˆTi for each bidder by numerically

integrating these allocation curves along the y axis. We then applied the approach described in
ˆTi · xi =
ˆTi · γi · αm−1(i). The latter optimization is simply the optimal assignment problem
maxm(·)
in decreasing order of ˆTi. We then estimate the expected revenue by the empirical revenue (cid:100)REV.
where each player’s value-per-click is ˆTi and can be performed by greedily assigning players to slots
We portray our results on the estimate ˆµ = ˆT(cid:100)REV

and the implied bound on the distributional price
of anarchy for each of the eleven search phrases in Table 4. Phrases are grouped based on thematic
category. Even though the worst-case price of anarchy of this auction is unbounded (since scores
si are not equal to qualities γi  which is required in worst-case POA proofs [1])  we observe that
empirically the price of anarchy is very good and on average the guarantee is approximately 80% of
the optimal. Even if si = γi the worst-case bound on the POA implies guarantees of approx. 34%
[1]  while the DPOA we estimated implies signiﬁcantly higher percentages  portraying the value of
the empirical approach we propose.
