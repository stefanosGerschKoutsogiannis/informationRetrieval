Abstract

We report a compact realization of short-term depression (STD) in a VLSI sto-
chastic synapse. The behavior of the circuit is based on a subtractive single re-
lease model of STD. Experimental results agree well with simulation and exhibit
expected STD behavior: the transmitted spike train has negative autocorrelation
and lower power spectral density at low frequencies which can remove redun-
dancy in the input spike train  and the mean transmission probability is inversely
proportional to the input spike rate which has been suggested as an automatic
gain control mechanism in neural systems. The dynamic stochastic synapse could
potentially be a powerful addition to existing deterministic VLSI spiking neural
systems.

1 Introduction

Synapses are the primary locations in neural systems where information is processed and transmit-
ted. Synaptic transmission is a stochastic process by nature  i.e. it has been observed that at central
synapses transmission proceeds in an all-or-none fashion with a certain probability. The synaptic
weight has been modeled as R = npq [1]  where n is the number of quantal release sites  p is the
probability of release per site  and q is some measure of the postsynaptic effect. The synapse un-
dergoes constant changes in order to learn from and adapt to the ever-changing outside world. The
variety of synaptic plasticities differ in the triggering condition  time span  and involvement of pre-
and postsynaptic activity. Regulation of the vesicle release probability has been considered as the
underlying mechanism for various synaptic plasticities [1–3]. The stochastic nature of the neural
computation has been investigated and the beneﬁts of stochastic computation such as energy efﬁ-
ciency  communication efﬁciency  and computational efﬁciency have been shown [4–6]. Recently
there is increasing interest in probabilistic modeling of brain functions [7]. VLSI stochastic synapse
could provide a useful hardware tool to investigate stochastic nature of the synapse and also function
as the basic computing unit for VLSI implementation of stochastic neural computation.

Although adaptive deterministic VLSI synapses have been extensively studied and developed for
neurally inspired VLSI learning systems [8–13]  stochastic synapses have been difﬁcult to imple-
ment in VLSI because it is hard to properly harness the probabilistic behavior  normally provided
by noise. Although stochastic behavior in integrated circuits has been investigated in the context of
random number generators (RNGs) [14]  these circuits either are too complicated to use for a sto-
chastic synapse or suffer from poor randomness. Therefore other approaches were explored to bring
randomness into the systems. Stochastic transmission was implemented in software using a lookup
table and a pseudo random number generator [15]. Stochastic transition between potentiation and
depression has been demonstrated in bistable synapses driven by stochastic spiking behavior at the
network level for stochastic learning [16].

Previously we reported the ﬁrst VLSI stochastic synapse. Experimental results demonstrated true
randomness as well as the adjustable transmission probability. The implementation with ∼ 15 tran-
sistors is compact for these added features  although there are much more compact deterministic

synapses with as few as ﬁve transistors. We also proposed the method to implement plasticity and
demonstrated the implementation of STD by modulating the probability of spike transmission. Like
its deterministic counterpart  this stochastic synapse operates on individual spike train inputs; its
stochastic character  however  creates the possibility of a broader range of computational primitives
such as rate normalization of Poisson spike trains  probabilistic multiplication  or coincidence de-
tection. In this paper we extend the subtractive single release model of STD to the VLSI stochastic
synapse. We present the simulation of the new model. We describe a novel compact VLSI imple-
mentation of a stochastic synapse with STD and demonstrate extensive experimental results showing
the agreement with both simulation and theory over a range of conditions and biases.

2 VLSI Stochastic Synapse and Plasticity

Figure 1: Schematic of the stochastic synapse with STD.

Previously we demonstrated a compact stochastic synapse circuit exhibiting true randomness and
consuming very little power (10-44 µW). The core of the structure is a clocked  cross-coupled dif-
ferential pair comparator with input voltages Vi+ and Vi−  as shown in the dashed box in Fig. 1.
It uses competition between two intrinsic circuit noise sources to generate random events. The dif-
ferential design helps to reduce the inﬂuence from other noise sources. When a presynaptic spike
arrives  Vpre∼ goes low  and transistor M5 shuts off. Vo+ and Vo− are nearly equal and the circuit is
in its metastable state. When the two sides are closely matched  the imbalance between Vo+ and Vo−
caused by current noise in M1-M4 eventually triggers positive feedback  which drives one output
to Vc and the other close to ground. We use a dynamic buffer  shown in the dotted box in Fig. 1 
to generate rail-to-rail transmitted spikes Vtran. Vtran either goes high (with probability p) or stays
low (with probability 1 − p) during an input spike  emulating stochastic transmission.
Fabrication mismatch in an uncompensated stochastic synapse circuit would likely permanently bias
the circuit to one solution. In this circuit  ﬂoating gate inputs to a pFET differential pair allow the
mismatch to be compensated. By controlling the common-mode voltage of the ﬂoating gates  we
operate the circuit such that hot-electron injection occurs only on the side where the output voltage
is close to ground. Over multiple clock cycles hot-electron injection works in negative feedback
to equalize the ﬂoating gate voltages  bringing the circuit into stochastic operation. The procedure
can be halted to achieve a speciﬁc probability or allowed to reach equilibrium (50% transmission
probability).

The transmission probability can be adjusted by changing the input offset or the ﬂoating gate
charges. The higher Vg+ is  the lower p is. The probability tuning function is closely ﬁtted by
an error function f(v) = 0.5
  where µ is the input offset voltage for p = 50% 
δ is the standard deviation characterizing the spread of the probability tuning  and v = Vi− − Vi+
is the input offset voltage. Synaptic plasticity can be implemented by dynamically modulating the
probability. Input offset modulation is suitable for short-term plasticity. Short-term depression is
triggered by the transmitted input spikes Vtran to emulate the probability decrease because of vesi-
cle depletion. Short-term facilitation is triggered by the input spikes Vpre to emulate the probability

able for long-term plasticity. STDP can be implemented by modulating the probability depending
on the precise timing relation between the pre- and postsynaptic spikes.

3 Short-Term Depression: Model and Simulation

Although long-term plasticity has attracted much attention because of its apparent association with
learning and memory  the functional role of short-term plasticity has only recently begun to be un-
derstood. Recent evidence suggests that short-term synaptic plasticity is involved in many functions
such as gain control [17]  phase shift [18]  coincidence detection  and network reconﬁguration [19].
It has also been shown that depressing stochastic synapses can increase information transmission
efﬁciency by ﬁltering out redundancy in presynaptic spike trains [5].

Activity dependent short-term changes in synaptic efﬁcacy at the macroscopic level are determined
by activity dependent changes in vesicle release probability at the microscopic level. We will focus
on STD here. STD during repetitive stimulation results from a decrease in released vesicles. Since
there is a ﬁnite pool of vesicles  and released vesicles cannot be replenished immediately  a success-
ful release triggered by one spike potentially reduces the probability of release triggered by the next
spike. We propose an STD model based on our VLSI stochastic synapse that closely emulates the
simple subtractive single release model [5  20]. A presynaptic spike that is transmitted reduces the
input offset voltage v at the VLSI stochastic synapse by ∆v  so that the transmission probability p(t)
is reduced. Between successful releases  v relaxes back to its maximum value vmax exponentially
with a time constant τd so that p(t) relaxes back to its maximum value pmax as well. The model can
be written as

v(t+) = v(t−) − ∆v  successful transmission at t
dv(t)

= vmax − v(t)

τd

p(t) = f(v(t))

(3)
For an input spike train with Poisson arrivals  the model can be expressed as a stochastic differential
equation

(4)
where dNp·r(t) is a Poisson counting process with rate p · r(t)  and r(t) is the input spike rate. By
taking the expectation E(·) on both sides  we obtain a differential equation

When v is reduced  the probability that it will be reduced again becomes smaller. v is effectively
constrained to a small range where we can approximate the function f(v) = 0.5
by a linear function f(v) = av + 0.5  where µ = 0 for simplicity. We can then solve for E(p) at
steady state:

Therefore the steady state mean probability is inversely proportional to the input spike rate when
a∆vτdr (cid:192) 1. This is consistent with prior work that modeled STD at the macroscopic level [17].
We simulated the model (1)-(3). We use the function f(v) = 0.5
  obtained
from the best ﬁt of the experimental data. Initially v is set to 5 mV which sets pmax close to 1.
Although the transformation from v to p is nonlinear  both simulation and experimental data show
that this implementation exhibits behavior similar to the model with the linear approximation and
the biological data. Fig. 2(a) and 2(b) show that the mean probability is a linear function of the
inverse of the input spike rate at various ∆v and τd for high input spike rates. Both ∆v and τd affect
the slope of the linear relation  following the trend suggested by (6): the bigger the ∆v or the bigger
the τd  the smaller the slope is. Fig. 3 shows a simulation of the transient probability for a period
of 200 ms. Fig. 4 shows that the output spike train exhibits negative autocorrelation at small time
intervals and lower power spectral density (PSD) at low frequencies. This is a direct consequence
of STD.

We implemented this model using the stochastic synapse circuit described above (see Fig. 1). Both
inputs are restored up to an equilibrium value Vicm by tunable resistors implemented by subthreshold
pFETs operating in the ohmic region. To change the transmission probability we only need to
modulate one side of the input  in this case Vi−. The resistor and capacitor provide for exponential
recovery of the voltage to its equilibrium value. The input Vi− is modulated by transistors M6
and M7 based on the result of the previous spike transmission. Every time a spike is transmitted
successfully  a pulse with height Vh and width Tp is generated at Vp. Tp is same as the input
spike pulse width. This pulse discharges the capacitor with a small current determined by Vw and
reduces Vi− by a small amount  thus decreasing the transmission probability. The value of the
tunable resistors is controlled by the gate voltage of the pFETs  Vr. When Vi− is reduced  the
probability that it will be reduced again becomes smaller. Since the probability tuning only occurs
in a small voltage range (∼ 10 mV)  the change in Vi− is limited to this small range as well. Under
this special condition  the resistance implemented by the subthreshold pFET is linear and large (∼
GΩ). With capacitance as small as 100 fF  the exponential time constant is tens of milliseconds and
is adjustable. Similar control circuits can be applied to Vi+ to implement short-term facilitation.
The update mechanism would then be driven by the presynaptic spike rather than the successfully
transmitted spike. The extra components on the left provide for future implementation of short-term
facilitation and also symmetrize the stochastic synapse  improving its randomness.

5 Experimental Results

The circuit has been fabricated in a commercially-available 0.5 µm CMOS process with 2 polysil-
icon layers and 3 metal layers. The layout size of the stochastic synapse is 151.9 µm × 91.7 µm
and the layout size of the STD block is 35 µm × 32.2 µm. A 2-to-1 multiplexer with size 35 µm
× 30 µm is used to enable or disable STD. As a proof of concept  the layout of the circuit is quite
conservative. Assuming no loss of performance  the existing circuit area could be reduced by 50%.

The circuit uses a nominal power supply of 5 V for normal operation. The differential pair compara-
tor uses a separate power supply for hot-electron injection. Each ﬂoating-gate pFET has a tunnelling
structure  which is a source-drain connected pFET with its gate connected to the ﬂoating node. A
separate power supply provides the tunnelling voltage to the shorted source and drain (tunnelling
node). When the tunnelling voltage is high enough (∼14-15 V)  electron tunnels through the sil-
icon dioxide  from the ﬂoating gate to the tunnelling node. We use this phenomenon to remove
electrons from the ﬂoating gate only during initialization. Alternatively Ultra-Violet (UV) activated
conductances may be used to remove electrons from the gate to avoid the need for special power
supplies.

To begin the test  we ﬁrst remove residual charges on the ﬂoating gates in the stochastic synapse.
We set Vicm = 2 V. We raise the power supply of the differential pair comparator to 5.3 V to
facilitate the hot-electron injection. We use the negative feedback operation of hot-electron injection
described above to automatically program the circuit into its stochastic regime. We halt the injection
by lowering the power supply to 5 V. During this procedure  STD is disabled  so that the probability
at this operating point is the synaptic transmission probability without any dynamics.

We then enable STD. We use a signal generator to generate pulse signals which serve as input
spikes. Although spike trains are better modeled by Poisson arrivals  the averaging behavior should
be similar for deterministic spike trains which make testing easier. We use Ibias = 100 nA. The
power consumption of the STD block is much smaller than the stochastic synapse. The total power
consumption is about 10 µW.

We collect output spikes from the depressing stochastic synapse at an input spike rate of 100 Hz. We
divide time into bins according to the input spike rate so that in each bin there is either 1 or 0 output
spike. In this way  we convert the output spike train into a bit sequence s(k). We then compute the
normalized autocorrelation  deﬁned as A(n) = E(s(k)s(k + n)) − E2(s(k))  where n is the num-
ber of time intervals between two bits. A(0) gives the variance of the sequence. For two bits with
distance n > 0  A(n) = 0 if they are independent  indicating good randomness  and A(n) < 0 if
they are anticorrelated  indicating the depressing effect of preceding spikes on the later spikes. Fig.
5 shows the autocorrelation of the output spike trains at two different Vr. There is signiﬁcant nega-

tive correlation at small time intervals and little correlation at large time intervals  as expected from
STD. Fig. 6 shows the PSD of the output spike trains from the same data shown in Fig. 5. Clearly 
the PSD is reduced at low frequencies. The time constant of STD increases with Vr so that the larger
Vr is  the longer the period of the negative autocorrelation is and the lower the frequencies where
power is reduced. This agrees with simulation results. Notice that the autocorrelation and PSD for
Vr = 1.59 V show very close similarity to the simulation results in Fig. 4. Normally redundant
information is represented by positive autocorrelation in the time domain  which is characterized by
power at low frequencies. By reducing the low frequency component of the spike train  redundant
information is suppressed and overall information transmission efﬁciency is improved. If the nega-
tive autocorrelation of the synaptic dynamics matches the positive autocorrelation in the input spike
train  the redundancy is cancelled and the output is uncorrelated [5].

Figure 5: Autocorrelation of output spike trains from the VLSI stochastic synapse with STD for
an input spike rate of 100 Hz. Autocorrelation at zero time represents the sequence variance  and
negative autocorrelation at short time intervals indicates STD.

Figure 6: Power spectral density of output spike trains from the VLSI stochastic synapse with STD
for an input spike rate of 100 Hz. Lower PSD at low frequencies indicates STD.

We collect output spikes in response to 104 input spikes at input spike rates from 100 Hz to 1000
Hz with 100 Hz intervals. Fig. 7(a) shows that the mean transmission probability is inversely pro-
portional to the input spike rate for various pulse widths when the rate is high enough. This matches
the theoretical prediction in (6) very well. By scaling the probability with the input spike rate  the
synapse tends to normalize the DC component of input frequency and preserve the neuron dynamic
range  thus avoiding saturation due to fast ﬁring presynaptic neurons and retaining sensitivity to less
frequently ﬁring neurons [17]. The slope of mean probability decreases as the pulse width increases.
Since the pulse width determines the discharging time of the capacitor at Vi−  the larger the pulse
width  the larger the ∆v is and the smaller the slope is. Fig. 7(b) shows that a∆vτd scales linearly
with the pulse width. The discharging current is approximately constant  thus ∆v is proportional to
the pulse width.

We perform the same experiments for different Vr and Vw. As Vr increases  the slope of mean
r decreases. This is due to the increasing τd = RC 
transmission probability as a linear function of 1
where the equivalent resistance R from the pFET increases with Vr. Fig. 8(a) shows that a∆vτd
is approximately an exponential function of Vr  indicating that the equivalent R of the pFET is ap-
proximately exponential to its gate voltage Vr. For Vw  the slope of mean transmission probability
decreases as Vw increases. This is due to the increasing ∆v with Vw. Fig. 8(b) shows that a∆vτd is
approximately an exponential function of Vw  indicating that the discharging current from the tran-
sistor M6 is approximately exponential to its gate voltage Vw. This matches the I-V characteristics
of the MOSFET in subthreshold.

6 Conclusion

We designed and tested a VLSI stochastic synapse with short-term depression. The behavior of
the depressing synapse agrees with theoretical predictions and simulation. The strength and time
duration of the depression can be tuned by the biases. The circuit is compact and consumes low
power. It is a good candidate to bring randomness and rich dynamics into VLSI spiking neural
