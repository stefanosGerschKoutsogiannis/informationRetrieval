Abstract

The inter-subject alignment of functional MRI (fMRI) data is important for im-
proving the statistical power of fMRI group analyses.
In contrast to existing
anatomically-based methods  we propose a novel multi-subject algorithm that de-
rives a functional correspondence by aligning spatial patterns of functional con-
nectivity across a set of subjects. We test our method on fMRI data collected
during a movie viewing experiment. By cross-validating the results of our algo-
rithm  we show that the correspondence successfully generalizes to a secondary
movie dataset not used to derive the alignment.

Introduction

Functional MRI (fMRI) studies of human neuroanatomical organization commonly analyze fMRI
data across a population of subjects. The effective use of this data requires deriving a spatial cor-
respondence across the set of subjects  i.e.  the data must be aligned  or registered  into a common
coordinate space. Current inter-subject registration techniques derive this correspondence by align-
ing anatomically-deﬁned features  e.g. major sulci and gyri  across subjects  either in the volume or
on extracted cortical surfaces. Talairach normalization [1]  for example  derives a piecewise afﬁne
transformation by matching a set of major anatomical landmarks in the brain volume. More ad-
vanced techniques match a denser set of anatomical features  such as cortical curvature [2]  and
derive nonlinear transformations between a reference space and each subject’s cortical surface.
It is known  however  that an accurate inter-subject functional correspondence cannot be derived
using only anatomical features  since the size  shape and anatomical location of functional loci
vary across subjects [3]  [4]. Because of this deﬁciency in current alignment methods  it is com-
mon practice to spatially smooth each subject’s functional data prior to a population based analysis.
However  this incurs the penalty of blurring the functional data within and across distinct cortical
regions. Thus  the functional alignment of multi-subject fMRI data remains an important problem.
We propose to register functional loci directly by using anatomical and functional data to learn an
inter-subject cortical correspondence. This approach was ﬁrst explored in [5]  where subject cortices
were registered by maximizing the inter-subject correlation of the functional response elicited by a
common stimulus (a movie viewing). In essence  the correspondence was selected to maximize the
correlation of the fMRI time series between subjects. This relies on the functional response being
time-locked with the experimental stimulus. Large regions of visual and auditory cortex stimulated
by a movie viewing do indeed show consistent inter-subject synchrony [6]. However  other areas in
the intrinsic [7] or default [8] system fail to exhibit signiﬁcant correlations across repeated stimulus
trials. The technique of [5] is hence not expected to improve alignment in these intrinsic regions.
In contrast to [5]  we propose to achieve inter-subject alignment by aligning intra-subject patterns
of cortical functional connectivity. By functional connectivity  we mean within-subject similarity of

the temporal response of remote regions of cortex [9]. This can be estimated from fMRI data  for
example  by correlating the functional time series between pairs of cortical nodes within a subject.
This yields a dense set of functional features for each subject from which we learn an inter-subject
correspondence. Unlike other functional connectivity work (see e.g. [10])  we deﬁne connectivity
between pairs of cortical nodes rather than with respect to anatomical regions of interest. Our
approach is inspired by studies showing that the patterns of functional connectivity in the intrinsic
network are consistent across subjects [7]  [11]. This suggests that our method has the potential to
learn an inter-subject functional correspondence within both extrinsic and intrinsic cortical networks.
In summary  we formulate a multi-subject cortical alignment algorithm that minimizes the difference
between functional connectivity vectors of corresponding cortical nodes across subjects. We do so
by learning a dense-deformation ﬁeld on the cortex of each subject  suitably regularized to preserve
cortical topology [2]. Our key contributions are: a) the novel alignment objective  b) a principled
algorithm for accomplishing the alignment  and c) experimental veriﬁcation on fMRI data.
The paper is organized as follows. In §2 we formulate the multi-subject alignment problem  followed
by a detailed exposition of the algorithm in §3 and §4. Finally  we exhibit results of the algorithm
applied to multi-subject fMRI data in §5 and draw conclusions in §6.

2 Formulation of the Multi-Subject Alignment Problem

For each subject we are given volumetric anatomical MRI data and fMRI data. The anatomical
data is used to extract a two-dimensional surface model of cortex. This greatly facilitates cortical
based analysis and subsequent visualization [12]  [13]  [14]. Cortex is segmented  then each cortical
hemisphere is inﬂated to obtain a smooth surface  which is projected to the sphere  S2  represented
by a discrete spherical mesh Ms = {pk ∈ S2; 1 ≤ k ≤ Nv/2}. The two cortical hemispheres
are hence modeled by the disjoint union S = S2 (cid:93) S2  represented by the corresponding disjoint
union of mesh points M = Ms (cid:93) Ms. Anatomical cortical features  such as cortical curvature  are
functions Da : S → RNa sampled on M. Thus  our analysis is restricted to cortex only.
The fMRI volumeric data is ﬁrst aligned with the anatomical scan  then mapped onto S. This assigns
each mesh node pk ∈ M a “volumetric cortical voxel” vk ∈ R3  with associated functional time
series fk ∈ RNt. The functional time series data is then a function Df : S → RNt sampled on M.
As indicated in the introduction  we do not directly register the fMRI time series but instead
register the functional connectivity derived from the time series. Let σ(f1  f2) denote a similar-
ity measure on pairs of time series f1  f2 ∈ RNt. A useful example is empirical correlation:
σ(f1  f2) = corr(f1  f2); another possibility is an estimate of the mutual information between
the pairwise entries of f1  f2. Deﬁne the functional connectivity of the fMRI data under σ as the
map C(pi  pj) = σ(Df (pi)  Df (pj))  i.e.  the similarity of the functional times series at the pairs of
cortical nodes. Functional connections both within and across cortical hemispheres are considered.
Functional connectivity can be conceptualized as the adjacency matrix of an edge-weighted graph
on all cortical nodes. The edge between nodes pi  pj is weighted by the pairwise similarity measure
σ(fi  fj) codifying the functional similarity of pi and pj. In the case of correlation  C is the correla-
tion matrix of the time series data. For typical values of Nv (≈ 72  000)  the functional connectivity
data structure is huge. Hence we need efﬁcient mechanisms for working with C.
We are given the data discussed above for Ns subjects. Subject k’s training data is speciﬁed by sam-
ples of the functions Da k : Sk → RNa  Df k : Sj → RNt  and the derived functional connectivity
Ck  all sampled on the mesh Mk  k = 1  . . .   Ns. Our objective is to learn a relation consisting
of Ns-tuples of corresponding points across the set of cortices. To do so  we could select a node
from M1 for subject 1 and learn the corresponding points on the cortices of the remaining Ns − 1
subjects through smooth and invertible mappings gk : S1 → Sk  k = 2  . . .   Ns. However  this arbi-
trarily and undesirably gives special status to one subject. Instead  we introduce a reference model
Sref = S2 (cid:93) S2 with mesh Mref. For each node p ∈ Mref on Sref  we seek to learn the Ns-tuple of
corresponding points (g1(p)  g2(p)  . . .   gNs(p))  parameterized by gk : Sref → Sk  k = 1  . . .   Ns.
In general terms  we can now summarize our task as follows: use the functional connectivity data
Ck  in conjunction with the anatomical data Da k  k = 1  . . .   Ns  to estimate warping functions
{gk : k = 1  . . .   Ns}  subject to speciﬁed regularity conditions  that bring some speciﬁed balance
of anatomy and functional connectivity into alignment across subjects. That said  for the remainder

2

of the paper we restrict attention to aligning only functional connectivity across subjects. There is
no doubt that anatomy must be an integral part of a full solution; but that aspect is not new  and is
already well understood. Restricting attention to the alignment of functional connectivity will allow
us to concentrate on the most novel and important aspects of our approach.
To proceed  assume a reference connectivity Cref  such that for each subject k = 1  . . .   Ns 

Ck(gk(pi)  gk(pj)) = Cref(pi  pj) + k(pi  pj) 

(1)
where Ck(gk(pi)  gk(pj)) = σ(Df k(gk(pi))  Df k(gk(pj)))  and k is zero-mean random noise.
Since gk(p) may not be a mesh point  computation of Df k(gk(p)) requires interpolation of the time
series using mesh nodes in a neighborhood of gk(p). This will be important as we proceed.
Given (1)  we estimate g by maximizing a regularized log likelihood:

pi  pj ∈ Mref

log P (C1  . . .   CNs|g) − λ(cid:80)

k Reg(gk)

(2)

ˆg = arg

max

g=(g1 ···  gNs )

where Reg(gk) constrains each warping function gk to be smooth and invertible. Here  we will
focus on the log likelihood term and delay the discussion of regularization to §3. Optimization of
(2) is complicated by the fact that Cref is a latent variable  so it must be estimated along with g.
We use Expectation-Maximization to iteratively alternate between computing an expectation of Cref
(E-step)  and a maximum likelihood estimate of g given both the observed and estimated unobserved
data (M-step) [15]. In the E-step  the expectation of Cref  C ref  conditioned on the current estimate

C ref(pi  pj) = 1/Ns

of g (cid:98)g  is computed by averaging the connectivity across subjects:
(cid:80)Ns
k=1 Ck((cid:98)gk(pi) (cid:98)gk(pj)) 
In the M-step  the estimate(cid:98)g is reﬁned to maximize the likelihood of the full data:
log P (C ref   C1  C2 ···   CNs|g)
(cid:80)
(cid:80)Ns
(cid:80)

(cid:98)g = arg

(C ref(pi  pj) − Ck(gk(pi)  gk(pj)))2

(cid:98)gk = arg min

pi  pj ∈ Sref

g=(g1 ···  gNs )

pi pj∈Sref

min

g=(g1 ···  gNs )

k=1

pi pj∈Sref

= arg

max

gk

where we have assumed that the noise in (1) is i.i.d. Gaussian. Because (4b) decouples  we can
optimize over each subject’s warp separately  i.e.  these optimizations can be done in parallel:

(C ref(pi  pj) − Ck(gk(pi)  gk(pj)))2

(3)

(4a)

(4b)

(5)

However  an interesting alternative is to perform these sequentially with an E-step after each that
updates the reference estimate C ref. This also allows some other interesting adaptations. We note:
(6a)

(C ref(pi  pj) − Ck(gk(pi)  gk(pj)))2 ∝ (C k(pi  pj) − Ck(gk(pi)  gk(pj)))2

where

C k(pi  pj) = 1

(7)
is the leave-one-out template for subject k  which is indepedendent of gk. Thus  we replace (5) by:
(8)

(C k(pi  pj) − Ck(gk(pi)  gk(pj)))2

(cid:98)gk = arg min

pi pj∈Sref

(cid:80)

(Ns−1)

gk

pi  pj ∈ Mref  

(cid:80)
n(cid:54)=k Cn((cid:98)gn(pi) (cid:98)gn(pj)) 

From (5) and (8) we observe that the multi-subject alignment problem reduces to a sequence of
pairwise registrations  each of which registers one subject to an average of connectivity matrices. If
we use (5)  each round of pairwise registrations can be done in parallel and the results used to update
the average template. The difﬁculty is the computational update of C ref. Alternatively  using (8)
we do the pairwise registrations sequentially and compute a new leave-one-out template after each
registration. This is the approach we pursue. An algorithm for solving the pairwise registration is
derived in the next section and we examine the computation of leave-one-out templates in §4.

3 Pairwise Cortical Alignment

We now develop an algorithm for aligning one subject  with connectivity CF   to a reference  with
connectivity CR  with CF   CR ∈ RNv×Nv. For concreteness  from this point forward we let
σ(f1  f2) = corr(f1  f2) and assume that the time series have zero mean and unit norm.

(cid:107) ˜CF − CR(cid:107)2

A function g : MR → SF maps a reference mesh point pi ∈ MR to g(pi) ∈ SF . By interpolating the
ﬂoating subject’s times series at the points g(pi) ∈ SF we obtain the associated warped functional
connectivity: ˜CF = [σ(f F

g(pj ))]. We seek(cid:98)g that best matches ˜CF to CR in the sense:
(cid:98)g = arg min

kernel Φ: f F (p) = (cid:80)Nv

(9)
Here (cid:107) · (cid:107)f is the matrix Frobenius norm and the regularization term Reg(g) serves as a prior over
the space of allowable mappings. In the following steps  we examine how to efﬁciently solve (9).
Step 1: Parameterizing the dependence of ˜CF on the warp. We ﬁrst develop the dependence
of the matrix ˜CF on the warping function g. This requires specifying how the time series at the
warped points g(pi) ∈ SF is interpolated using the time series data {f F
i ∈ RNt  i = 1  . . .   Nv} at
the mesh points {pF
i ∈ MF   i = 1  . . .   Nv}. Here  we employ linear interpolation with a spherical
i Φ(p  pi)  p ∈ SF . The kernel should be matched to the following
speciﬁc objectives: (a) The kernel should be monomodal. Since the gradient of the registration
objective depends on the derivative of the interpolation kernel  this will reduce the likelihood of the
algorithm converging to a local minimum; (b) The support of the kernel should be ﬁnite. This will
limit interpolation complexity. However  as the size of the support decreases  so will the capture
range of the algorithm. At the initial stages of the algorithm  the kernel should have a broad extent 
due to higher initial uncertainty  and become increasingly more localized as the algorithm converges.
Thus  (c) The support of the kernel should be easily adjustable.
With these considerations in mind  we select Φ(p  pi) to be a spherical radial basis function Φi :
S2 → R centered at pi ∈ S2 and taking the form: Φi(p) = ϕ(d(p  pi))  p ∈ S2  where ϕ : [0  π] →
R and d(p  pi) is the spherical geodesic distance between p and pi [16]. Then Φi(p) is monomodal
with a maximum at pi  it depends only on the distance between p and pi and is radially symmetric.
In detail  we employ the particular spherical radial basis function:

i=1 f F

Φi(p) = ϕ(d(p  pi)) = (1 − (2/r) sin(d(p  pi)/2))4

(10)
where r is a ﬁxed parameter  and (a)+ = a1{a ≥ 0}. Φi(p) has two continuous derivatives and its
support is {p ∈ S2 : d(p  pi) < 2 sin−1(r/2)}. Note that the support can be easily adjusted through
the parameter r. So the kernel has all of our desired properties.
We can now make the dependence of ˜CF on g more explicit. Let TF = [f F

+((8/r) sin(d(p  pi)/2) + 1)

]. Then

f F (g(pNv))(cid:3) = TF A where A = [Φi(g(pj))] is the Nv ×

(cid:101)TF =(cid:2)f F (g(p1))

Nv matrix of interpolation coefﬁcients dependent on g and the interpolation kernel. Next  noting
that CF = T T

F TF   we use A to write the post-warp correlation matrix as:

(11)
where D = diag(d1  d2 ···   dNv) serves to normalize the updated data to unit norm: dj =
(cid:107)f F (g(pj))(cid:107)−1. Finally  we use ˜A = AD to write:

(cid:107) ˜CF − CR(cid:107)2

f = (cid:107) ˜AT CF ˜A − CR(cid:107)2

f

(12)
Here  (12) encodes the dependence of the registration objective on g through the matrix ˜A. It is also
important to note that since the interpolation kernel is locally supported  ˜A is a sparse matrix.
Step 2: Efﬁcient Representation/Computation of the Registration Objective. We now consider
the Nv × Nv matrices CF and CR. At a spatial resolution of 2 mm  the spherical model of human
cortex can yield Nv ≈ 72  000 total mesh points. In this situation  direct computation with CF and
CR is prohibitive. Hence we need an efﬁcient way to represent and compute the objective (12).
For fMRI data it is reasonable to assume that Nt (cid:28) Nv. Hence  since the data has been centered  the
R TR is at most Nt − 1. For simplicity  we make the reasonable
rank of CF = T T
assumption that rank(TF ) = rank(TR) = d. Then CF and CR can be efﬁciently represented by
compact d-dimensional SVDs CF = VF ΣF V T
F and CR = VRΣRV T
R . Moveover  these can be
computed directly from SVDs of the data matrices: TF = UTF ΣTF V T

The above representation avoids computing CF and CR  but we must also show that it enables
efﬁcient evaluation of (12). To this end  introduce the following linear transformation:

closer examination. Now (16) can be viewed as a projection of the rows of V T

Hence a QR-factorization QR = ˜AT VF − VRBT
1 yields d ON vectors in null(CR). Choosing these
as the ﬁrst d columns of V ⊥
In summary  we have derived the following efﬁcient means of evaluating the objective. By one-
time preprocessing of the time series data we obtain ΣF   ΣR and VF   VR. Then given a warp g 
we compute: the interpolation matrix ˜A  B1 = V T
˜AVR  and ﬁnally B2 via QR factorization of
˜AT VF − VRBT
Step 3: The Transformation Space and Regularization. We now examine the speciﬁcation of g in
greater detail. We allow each mesh point to move freely (locally) in two directions. The use of such
nonlinear warp models for inter-subject cortical alignment has been validated over  for example 
rigid-body transformations [17]. To specify g  we ﬁrst need to set up a coordinate system on the
sphere. Let U = {(φ  θ); 0 < φ < π  0 < θ < 2π}. Then the sphere can be parameterized by
x: U → R3 with x(φ  θ) = (sin φ cos θ  sin φ sin θ  cos φ). Here  φ is a zenith angle measured
against one of the principal axes  and θ is an azimuthal angle measured in one of the projective
planes (i.e.  xy-plane  xz-plane  or yz-plane). Note that x omits a semicircle of S2; so at least two
such parameterizations are required to cover the entire sphere [18].
Consider pi ∈ S2 parameterized by x(φ  θ) such that pi = x(φi  θi). Then the warp ﬁeld at pi is:

1 . Then we evaluate (15).

F

g(pi) = x(φi + ∆φi  θi + ∆θi) = x( ˜φi  ˜θi)

(17)

for displacements ∆φi and ∆θi. The warp g is thus parameterized by: { ˜φi  ˜θi  i = 1  . . .   Nv}.
The warp g must be regularized to avoid undesired topological distortions (e.g. folding and excessive
expansion) and to avoid over-ﬁtting the data. This is achieved by adding a regularization term to the
objective that penalizes such distortions. There are several ways this can be done. Here we follow
[14] and regularize g by penalizing both metric and areal distortion. The metric distortion term
penalizes warps that disrupt local distances between neighboring mesh nodes. This has the effect of
limiting the expansion/contraction of cortex. The areal distortion term seeks to preserve a consistent
orientation of the surface. Given a triangularization of the spherical mesh  each triangle is given
an oriented normal vector that initially points radially outward from the sphere. Constraining the
oriented area of all triangles to be positive prevents folds in the surface [14].
Step 4: Optimization of the objective. We optimize (3) over g by gradient descent. De-

note the objective by S(g)  let (cid:101)aij = aijdj be the (i  j)-th entry of ˜A = AD and a(p) =
··· ΦNv(p)]T . From the parameterization of the warp (17)  we see that(cid:101)aij =

To help avoid local minima we take a multi-resolution optimization approach [19]. The registration
is run on a sequence of spatial resolutions r1 > r2 > ··· > rM   with rM given by the original
resolution of the data. The result at resolution rm is used to initialize the alignment at resolution
rm+1. The alignment for rm is performed by matching the kernel parameter r in (10) to rm. Note
that the reference dataset is also spatially smoothed at each rm by the transformation in (11)  with
A = [a(p1) a(p2) ··· a(pNv)]. The pairwise algorithm is summarized as Algorithm 1 in Figure 1.

4 Multi-Subject Alignment: Computing Leave-one-out Templates

We now return to the multi-subject alignment problem  which is summarized as Algorithm 2 in
Figure 1. It only remains to discuss efﬁcient computation of the leave-one-out-template (7). Since
C k is an average of Ns − 1 positive semi-deﬁnite matrices each of rank d  the rank d of C k is

bounded as follows d ≤ d ≤ (Ns − 1)d. Assume that (cid:101)Cn  the connectivity matrix of subject n after
warp gn (see (11))  has an efﬁcient d (cid:28) Nv dimensional SVD representation (cid:101)Cn = (cid:101)Vn(cid:101)Σn(cid:101)V T

n .

To compute the SVD for C k  we exploit the sequential nature of the multi-subject alignment algo-
rithm by reﬁning the SVD of the leave-one-out template for subject k−1  C k−1 = V k−1Σk−1V

k−1 
computed in the previous iteration. This is achieved by expressing C k in terms of C k−1:

and computing matrix decompositions for the singular vectors of (cid:101)Ck−1 and (cid:101)Ck in terms of V k−1:

(19)

C k = C k−1 + 1

k−1(cid:101)Vj ∈ Rd×d  for j = k − 1  k  projects the columns of (cid:101)Vj onto the columns of

We now compute the SVD of G = VGΣGV T

(23)
For a moderate number of subjects  (d + d) ≤ Nsd (cid:28) Nv  this approach is more efﬁcient than a
brute-force O(N 3

of each warped connectivity matrix (cid:101)Ck  alleviating the need to store large Nv × Nv matrices.

5 Experimental Results

We tested the algorithm using fMRI data collected from 10 subjects viewing a movie split into
2 sessions separated by a short break. The data was preprocessed following [5]. For each
subject  a structural scan was acquired before each session  from which the cortical surface
model was derived (§2) and then anatomically aligned to a template using FreeSurfer (Fischl 
http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu). Similar to [5]  we ﬁnd that anatomical alignment based on cor-
tical curvature serves as a superior starting point for functional alignment over Talairach alignment.
First  functional connectivity was found for each subject and session: Ck i  k = 1  . . .   Ns  i = 1  2.
These were then aligned within subjects  Ck 1 ↔ Ck 2  and across subjects  Ck 1 ↔ Cj 2  using Al-
gorithm 1. Since the data starts in anatomical correspondence  we expect small warp displacements
within subject and larger ones across subjects. The mean intra-subject warp displacement was 0.72
mm (σ = 0.48)  with 77% of the mesh nodes warped less than 1 mm and fewer than 1.5% warped by
more than the data spatial resolution (2 mm). In contrast  the mean inter-subject warp displacement
was 1.46 mm (σ = 0.92 mm)  with 22% of nodes warped more than 2 mm. See Figures 2(a)-(b).
In a separate analysis  each subject was aligned to its leave-one-out template on each session using
Algorithm 1  yielding a set of warps gk i(pj)  k = 1  . . .   Ns  i = 1  2  j = 1  . . .   Nv. To evaluate
the consistency of the correspondence derived from different sessions  we compared the warps gk 1
to gk 2 for each subject k. Here  we only consider nodes that are warped by at least the data resolu-
tion. This analysis provides a measure of the sensitivity to noise present in the fMRI data. At node
pj  we compute the angle 0 ≤ θ ≤ π between the warp tangent vectors of gk 1(pj) and gk 2(pj).
This measures the consistency of the direction of the warp across sessions: smaller values of θ sug-
gest a greater warp coherence across sessions. Figure 2(c) shows a histogram of θ averaged across
the cortical nodes of all 10 subjects. The tight distribution centered near θ = 0 suggests signiﬁcant
consistency in the warp direction across sessions. In particular  93% of the density for θ lies inside
π/2  81% inside π/4  and 58% inside π/8. As a secondary comparison  we compute a normalized
consistency measure WNC(pj) = d(gk 1(pj)  gk 2(pj))/(d(gk 1(pj)  pj) + d(gk 2(pj)  pj))  where
d(· ·) is spherical geodesic distance. The measure takes variability in both warp angle and magni-
tude into account; it is bounded between 0 and 1  and WNC(pj) = 0 only if gk 1(pj) = gk 2(pj). A
histogram for WNC is given in 2(d); WNC exhibits a peak at 0.15  with a mean of 0.28 (σ = 0.22).
Finally  Algorithm 2 was applied to the ﬁrst session fMRI data to learn a set of warps g =
(g1  . . .   gNs) for 10 subjects. The alignment required approximately 10 hours on a Intel 3.8GHz
Nehalem quad-core processor with 12GB RAM. To evaluate the alignment  we apply the warps to
the held out second session fMRI data  where subjects viewed a different segment of the movie. This
warping yields data {f k
gk(pi)} for each subject k  with interpolation performed in the original vol-
ume to avoid artiﬁcial smoothing. The cross-validated inter-subject correlation ISC(pi) is the mean

We compare the cross-validated ISC map with the ISC map of the second session movie viewing
computed under anatomical correspondence. Mean ISC improved by 18%  from 0.072 to 0.085. In
addition  the number of signiﬁcant inter-subject correlations (ISC(pi) > 0.1  P < 0.01) increased
by 22.9%  from 19  362 to 23  789. Figure 3 shows the ISC maps computed under anatomical
alignment and functional alignment on the inﬂated right cortical hemisphere. As expected  the areas
of improvement in inter-subject correlation are consistent with the extrinsic regions of cortex [6].

6 Conclusion

We have proposed a novel cortical registration algorithm that produces a functional correspondence
across a set of subjects. The algorithm uses the fMRI data directly to align the spatial patterns of
functional response elicited by a movie viewing. Despite the high-dimensionality of the data under
consideration  the algorithm is efﬁcient in both space and time complexity.
By comparing the inter-subject alignments derived from different fMRI experimental sessions  we
show that the correspondence is consistent and robust to noise and variability in the fMRI temporal
response. We also cross-validate the correspondence on independent test data that was not used
to derive the alignment. On the test data  the algorithm produces a consistent increase in inter-
subject correlation of fMRI time series  suggesting that functional alignment of extrinsic regions of
cortex that are directly driven by the movie viewing experiment  such as visual and auditory areas 
is improved considerably. Further testing is warranted to evaluate improvement in intrinsic areas of
cortex whose response is not temporally synchronized with the experimental stimulus.
