Abstract

As an indispensable component  Batch Normalization (BN) has successfully im-
proved the training of deep neural networks (DNNs) with mini-batches  by normal-
izing the distribution of the internal representation for each hidden layer. However 
the effectiveness of BN would diminish with the scenario of micro-batch (e.g. less
than 4 samples in a mini-batch)  since the estimated statistics in a mini-batch are
not reliable with insufﬁcient samples. This limits BN’s room in training larger
models on segmentation  detection  and video-related problems  which require
small batches constrained by memory consumption. In this paper  we present a
novel normalization method  called Kalman Normalization (KN)  for improving
and accelerating the training of DNNs  particularly under the context of micro-
batches. Speciﬁcally  unlike the existing solutions treating each hidden layer as
an isolated system  KN treats all the layers in a network as a whole system  and
estimates the statistics of a certain layer by considering the distributions of all its
preceding layers  mimicking the merits of Kalman Filtering. On ResNet50 trained
in ImageNet  KN has 3.4% lower error than its BN counterpart when using a batch
size of 4; Even when using typical batch sizes  KN still maintains an advantage
over BN while other BN variants suffer a performance degradation. Moreover 
KN can be naturally generalized to many existing normalization variants to obtain
gains  e.g.equipping Group Normalization [34] with Group Kalman Normalization
(GKN). KN can outperform BN and its variants for large scale object detection and
segmentation task in COCO 2017.

Introduction

Batch Normalization (BN) [13] has recently become a standard and crucial component for improving
the training of deep neural networks (DNNs)  which is successfully employed to harness several
state-of-the-art architectures[8  27]. In the training and inference of DNNs  BN normalizes the
internal representations of each hidden layer by subtracting the mean and dividing the standard
deviation  as illustrated in Fig. 1 (a). As pointed out in [13]  BN enables using larger learning rate in
training  leading to faster convergence.
Although the signiﬁcance of BN has been demonstrated in many previous works  its drawback
cannot be neglected  i.e.its effectiveness diminishing when small mini-batch is presented in training.
Consider a DNN consisting of a number of layers from bottom to top. In the traditional BN  the

Figure 1: (a) illustrates the distribution estimation in
the conventional BN  where the mini-batch mean µk
and variance Σk  are estimated based on the currently

observed mini-batch at the k-th layer. X and(cid:98)X denote

the internal representation before and after normaliza-
tion. In (b)  the proposed KN provides more accurate
distribution estimation of the k-th layer  by aggregating
the statistics of the preceding (k-1)-th layer.

normalization step seeks to eliminate the change in the distributions of its internal layers  by reducing
their internal covariant shifts. Prior to normalizing the distribution of a layer  BN ﬁrst estimates its
statistics 
including the means and variances.
However  it is impractically expected that the s-
tatistics of the internal layers can be pre-estimated
on the training set  as the representations of the
internal layers keep changing after the network
parameters have been updated in each training
step. Hence  BN handles this issue by the fol-
lowing schemes. i) During the model training  it
approximates the population statistics by using
the batch sample statistics in a mini-batch.
ii)
It retains the moving average statistics in each
training iteration  and employs them during the
inference.
However  BN has a limitation  which is limited
by the memory capacity of computing platforms
(e.g.GPUs)  especially when the network size and image size are large. In this case  the mini-batch
size is not sufﬁcient to approximate the statistics  making them had bias and noise. And the errors
would be ampliﬁed when the network becomes deeper  degenerating the quality of the trained model.
Negative effects exist also in the inference  where the normalization is applied for each testing sample.
Furthermore  in the BN mechanism  the distribution of a certain layer could vary along with the
training iteration  which limits the stability of the convergence of the model.
The demanding on batch size limits the performance of many computer vision task  such as detection
[7  9]  segmentation [3]  video recognition [28]  and other high-level systems built upon them [32  31].
For instance  limited by the heavy burden of model and the high resolution of images  the Mask
RCNN frameworks [9] can only allow an extremely micro batch (e.g.1 or 2)  which disable the
function of BN as discussed above. Compromisingly  a common way is to ’freeze’ the BN  in which
BN degrades into a linear layer because the statistics it uses are ﬁxed as constants.
In this paper  we present a new normalization method  called Kalman Normalization (KN)  for
improving and accelerating training of DNNs particularly under the context of micro-batches. KN
advances the existing solutions by achieving more accurate estimation of the statistics (means and
variances) of the internal representations in DNNs. Unlike BN where the statistics were estimated by
only measuring the mini-batches within a certain layer  i.e.they considered each layer in the network
as an isolated sub-system  KN shows that the estimated statistics have strong correlations among
the sequential layers. And the estimations can be more accurate by jointly considering its preceding
layers in the network  as illustrated in Fig. 1 (b). By analogy  the proposed estimation method shares
merits compared to the Kalman ﬁltering process [14]. KN performs two steps in an iterative way. In
the ﬁrst step  KN estimates the statistics of the current layer conditioned on the estimations of the
previous layer. In the second step  these estimations are combined with the observed batch sample
means and variances calculated within a mini-batch.
This paper makes the following contributions. 1) We propose an intuitive yet effective normalization
method  offering a promise of improving and accelerating the neural network training. 2) The
proposed method enables training networks with mini-batches of very small sizes (e.g. less than
4 examples)  and the resulting models perform substantially better than those using the existing
BN methods. This speciﬁcally makes our method advantageous in several memory-consuming
problems such as large scale object detection and segmentation task in COCO 2017. 3) On ImageNet
classiﬁcation task  the experiments show that the recent advanced networks can be strengthened by
our method  and the trained models improve the leading results by using less than 60% training steps.
And the computational complexity of KN increases only 0.015× compared to that of BN  leading to
a marginal additional computation.
2 Related Work
Whitening. Decorrelating and whitening the input data [16] has been demonstrated to speed up
training of DNNs. Some following methods [33  22  21] were proposed to whiten activations by using
sampled training data or performing whitening every thousands iterations to reduce computation.
Nevertheless  these operations would lead to model blowing up according to [13]  because of

2

ΣΧ𝜇NormΧNorm𝜇ΣΣ𝜇𝑘−1𝑘−1𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘෠Χ෠Χ(a)(b)instability of training. Recently  the Whitened Neural Network [5] and its generalizations [18  17  11]
presented practical implementations to whiten the internal representation of each hidden layer  and
drew the connections between whitened networks and natural gradient descent. Although these
approaches had theoretical guarantee and achieved promising results by reducing the computational
complexity of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in whitening  their computational costs
are still not neglectable  especially when training a DNN with plenty of convolutional layers on a
large-scale dataset (e.g.ImageNet)  as many recent advanced deep architectures did.
Standardization. To address the above issues  instead of whitening  Ioffe et al.[13] proposed to
normalize the neurons of each hidden layer independently  where the batch normalization (BN) is
calculated by using mini-batch statistics. The extension [4] adapted BN to recurrent neural networks
by using a re-parameterization of LSTM. In spite of their successes  the heavy dependence of the
activations in the entire batch causes some drawbacks to these methods. For example  when the mini-
batch size is small  the batch statistics are unreliable. Hence  several works [25  2  1  26  10  34] have
been proposed to alleviate the mini-batch dependence. Normalization propagation [1] attempted to
normalize the propagation of the network by using a careful analysis of the nonlinearities  such as the
rectiﬁed linear units. Layer normalization [2]  Instance Normalization [29]  and Group Normalization
(GN) [34] standardized the hidden layer activations  which are invariant to feature shifting and scaling
of per training sample. Fixed normalization [26] provided an alternative solution  which employed
a separate and ﬁxed mini-batch to compute the normalization parameters. However  all of these
methods estimated the statistics of the hidden layers separately  whereas KN treats the entire network
as a whole to achieve better estimations. Moreover  KN can be naturally applied to many existing
normalization variants to obtain gains  e.g.equipping Group Normalization (GN) with Group Kalman
Normalization (GKN)
3 The Proposed Approach
Overview. Here we introduce some necessary notations that will be used throughout this paper. Let
xk be the feature vector of a hidden neuron in the k-th hidden layer of a DNN  such as a pixel in the
hidden convolutional layer of a CNN. BN normalizes the values of xk by using a mini-batch of m
samples  B = {xk

m(cid:88)
(xk
(1)
√
They are adopted to normalize xk. We have ˆxk ← xk
  where diag(·) denotes the diagonal
entries of a matrix  i.e.the variances of xk. Then  the normalized representation is scaled and shifted
to preserve the modeling capacity of the network  yk ← γ ˆxk + β  where γ and β are parameters that
are opmizted in training. However  a mini-batch with moderately large size is required to estimate
the statistics in BN. It is compelling to explore better estimations of the distribution in a DNN to
accelerate training.
3.1 DNN as Kalman Filtering Process
Assume that the true values of the hidden neurons in the k-th layer can be represented by the variable
xk  which is approximated by using the values in the previous layer xk−1. We have

xk = Akxk−1 + uk 

(2)
where Ak is a state transition matrix (e.g. convolutional ﬁlters) that transforms the states (features) in
the previous layer to the current layer. And uk is a bias following a Gaussian distribution. As the
above true values of xk exist yet not directly accessible  they can be measured by the observation zk
with a bias term vk 

(3)
where zk indicates the observed values of the features in a mini-batch. Then  the estimation of true
value of the k-th layer’s hidden neurons ˆxk|k and their variances ˆΣk|k can be easily obtained by a

zk = xk + vk 

(4)

standard Kalman ﬁltering process:

ˆxk|k−1 = Ak ˆxk−1|k−1 
ˆΣk|k−1 = Ak ˆΣk−1|k−1(Ak)T + R 
ˆxk|k = f (qk  ˆxk|k−1  zk) 
ˆΣk|k = g(qk  ˆΣk|k−1  Sk) 

3

where ˆxk|k−1 and ˆΣk|k−1 are the estimation of true value and the variances of the k-th layer
conditioned on the previous layer  respectively. f (·) and g(·) are two linear combination functions in
the original Kalman ﬁltering process. R is the covariance matrix of the bias uk in Eqn.(2). Sk is the
observed covariance matrix of the mini-batch in the k-th layer. qk is the gain value.

3.2 Kalman Normalization
Eqn. 4 is a Kalman ﬁltering process  in which the true value of the k-th layer’s hidden neurons ˆxk|k
and their variances ˆΣk|k are estimated. But in a BN problem the desired quantity to estimate includes
not just the variances  but also the means ˆµk|k. Fortunately  the means can be easily obtained due
to the Kalman ﬁlter property. Speciﬁcally  we compute expectation on both sides of Eqn.(2) and 3 
i.e.E[xk] = E[Akxk−1 + uk] and E[zk] = E[xk + vk]  and have

ˆµk|k−1 = Ak ˆµk−1|k−1  E[zk] = xk

(5)
where ˆµk−1|k−1 denotes the estimation of mean in the (k-1)-th layer  and ˆµk|k−1 is the estimation of
mean in the k-th layer conditioned on the previous layer. We call ˆµk|k−1 an intermediate estimation
of the layer k  because it is then combined with the mean of observed values to achieve the ﬁnal
estimation. As shown in Eqn.(6) below  the estimation in the current layer ˆµk|k is computed by
combining the intermediate estimation with a bias term  which represents the error between the mean
of the observed values E[zk] and ˆµk|k−1. Here E[zk] indicates the mean of the observed values and
we have E[zk] = xk in Eqn. 5. And qk is a gain value indicating how much we reply on this bias.

ˆµk|k = ˆµk|k−1 + qk(xk − ˆµk|k−1).

(6)
Similarly  the estimations of the covariances can be achieved by calculating ˆΣk|k−1 = Cov(xk −
ˆµk|k−1) and ˆΣk|k = Cov(xk− ˆµk|k)  where Cov(·) represents the deﬁnition of the covariance matrix.
By introducing pk = 1 − qk  and combining the above deﬁnitions with Eqn.(5) and (6)  we have the
following update rules to estimate the statistics as shown in Eqn.(7).



ˆµk|k−1 = Ak ˆµk−1|k−1 
ˆµk|k = pk ˆµk|k−1 + qk ¯xk 
ˆΣk|k−1 = Ak ˆΣk−1|k−1(Ak)T + R 
ˆΣk|k = pk ˆΣk|k−1 + qkSk 

(7)

where ˆΣk|k−1 and ˆΣk|k denote the intermediate and the ﬁnal estimations of the covaraince matrixes
in the k-th layer respectively. In the original Kalman Filtering process  the transition matrix Ak 
the covariance matrix R  and the gain value qk are computed from hand-crafted formulations  but
in Eqn.(7) they are all rethought as learnable parameters in a pure data-driven manner for learning
efﬁciency.
In CNNs  the transition matrix Ak equals to the convolutional ﬁlter  but both the mean ˆµk−1|k−1
and the ˆΣk−1|k−1 are vectors. Applying convolution to vectors is impractical. Fortunate-
ly  the Monte-Carlo Sampling Theory [30] provides a solution. Speciﬁcally  some data y ∼

Figure 2: The estimations in the k-th layer (i.e.ˆµk|k and ˆΣk|k) are based on the estimations of the (k-1)-th layer
(i.e.ˆµk−1|k−1 and ˆΣk−1|k−1)  where these estimations are updated by combining with the observed statistics of
the k-th layer (i.e.X k). This process treats the entire DNN as a whole system  different from existing works that
estimated the statistics of each hidden layer independently.

obtain Aky. Finally  the intermediate estimations ˆµk|k−1 and ˆΣk|k−1 are obtained by calculating the
mean and the variance of Aky.
In training of KN  we employ ˆµk|k and ˆΣk|k to normalize the hidden representation. Similar to BN 
KN also retains the moving average statistics to appropriate the population statistics in each training
iteration  and employs them during the inference.
From the above  KN has two unique characteristics that distinguish it from BN. First  it offers a
better estimation of the distribution. In contrast to the existing normalization methods  the depth
information is explicitly exploited in KN. For instance  the prior message of the distribution of the
input image data is leveraged to improve estimation of the second layer’s statistics. On the contrary 
ignoring the sequential dependence of the network ﬂow requires larger batch size. Second  KN offers
a more stable estimation when learning proceeds  where the information ﬂow from prior state to the
current state becomes more stable.
Fig.2 illustrates a diagram of KN. Unlike BN where statistics are computed only within each layer
independently  KN uses messages from all proceeding layers to improve the statistic estimations in
the current layer.

3.3 Generalized Kalman Normalization
KN can also serve as an essential component. It is not specially designed for only BN  it can be
combined with different BN variants. Without loss of generality  we rewrite Eqn. 1 as

where Si is the set of pixels in which the mean/variance are computed. Speciﬁcally  in BN the set
Si is deﬁned as Si = {gC = iC} with iC as the sub-index of i along the channel axis C. Similarly 
C/G}  where G is a hyper-parameter and
in GN [34] Si is deﬁned as Si = {g|gN = iN   gC
N denotes the batch axis. Once obtaining ¯xk and Sk  we immediately equip them with Kalman
Normalization using Eqn. 7. Different deﬁnitions of Si bring different Kalman Normalization  such
as Batch Kalman Normalization (BKN  or KN by default) and Group Kalman Normalization
(GKN).

C/G = iC

3.4 Kalman Normalization Property

Handling micro-batch training. In a convolutional layer  activations of the same feature map at
different locations (pixels) should be normalized in the same way. Therefore  we jointly normalize all
the activations in a mini-batch over all locations (pixels) by following BN. Suppose that a layer has a
mini-batch of n and its feature maps have p pixels  its effective mini-batch to normalization is n × p
rather than only n.
This reveals another beneﬁt of KN. According to Eqn.(7)  the mean of the l-th layer can be computed
as ˆµl|l = plAl ˆµl−1|l−1 + ql ¯xl. We rewrite it as ˆµl|l = g(ˆµl−1|l−1  ¯xl). And ˆµl−1|l−1 can be
further decomposed by using the estimations of in the previous (l-2) layers. Recursively  we have
ˆµl|l = g(ˆµ0|0  ¯x1  ¯x2  ...  ¯xl)  where ˆµ0|0 denotes the mean of the whole dataset. This implies that in
order to compute the statistics of the l-th layer  we achieve it by implicitly using the feature maps of
all layers below  i.e.the effective mini-batch becomes n × (p1 + p2 + ... + pl) rather than only n × p 
where pl denotes the number of the pixels in the l-th layer’s feature map. In this way we enlarge the
effective batch size to handle the micro-batch training.
Micro-batch training vs data parallelism vs model parallelism. Usually  data parallelism with a
large batch size is still a micro-batch training scenario  since statistical estimation in BN need to
be performed in each single GPU separately. This is different from averaging gradients in SGD:
synchronizing gradients in SGD is cheap  but synchronizing the statistic in BN is expensive. In the
former  all GPUs only need to wait once after each iteration  while in the latter  all GPUs need to wait
at each BN layer. Given a network with 100 BN layers  there will be 100× more communication cost 
making statistics synchronization in BN impractical. Unless otherwise speciﬁed  the “batch size” in
the paper refers to mini-batch in a single GPU. For example  typically batch size of 32 samples/GPU
is used to train a ImageNet model. Normalizations are accomplished within each GPU  and the
gradients are aggregated over 8 GPUs to update the network parameters.

5

Similarly  model parallelism is also impractical for BN. To enable large-batch training  there are two
ways to parallelize the model. i) The network is split by layer into GPUs. Without losing accuracy 
we should forward-pass the data GPU by GPU  then back-propagate the errors GPU by GPU. This
is inefﬁcient due to the waiting & communicating time . ii) The network is split by channel. By
blocking the information exchange between channels  the accuracy drops. The compromise between
efﬁciency and accuracy makes model parallelism impractical for BN.
There are many typical memory-consuming scenarios that beneﬁts from micro-batches training  such
as training large-scale wide and deep networks and semantic image segmentation. Video-related
problems (e.g. video detection) and object detection frameworks (e.g. Faster R-CNN [23] and Mask
R-CNN [9]) are more eager for micro-batch  where batch size is typically small (<2) in each GPU.
Comparison with shortcuts in ResNet. Although shortcut connection also incorporates information
from previous layers  KN has two unique characteristics that distinguish it from shortcut connection.
1) KN provides better statistic estimation. In shortcut connection  the informations of previous layer
and current layer are simply summed up. No distribution estimation is performed. 2) In theory KN
can be applied to shortcut connection  because we have received the entire feature map  then we can
easily obtain the mean/variance from the feature map.

ImageNet Classiﬁcation

We ﬁrst evaluate KN on ImageNet 2012 classiﬁcation dataset [24] which consists of 1  000 categories.
The models are trained on the 1.28M training images and evaluated on the 50k validation images. We
examine top-1 accuracy. Our baseline models are three representative networks  including Inceptionv2
[27]  ResNet50  and ResNet101 [8]. In the original models  BN is stacked after convolution and
before the ReLU activation [19]. KN is applied by simply replacing BN. We also compare with the
recently proposed BRN [12] and GN [34]  which can be applied in a similar manner.

Table 1 compares the top-1 validation accura-

of 74.0% when training converged  outperform-

ing the original network [13] by 1.0% . This
improvement is attributed to two reasons. First  by leveraging the messages from the previous layers 
estimation of the statistics is more stable in KN  making training converged faster  especially in the
early stage. Second  this procedure also reduces the internal covariance shift  leading to discriminative
representation learning and hence improving classiﬁcation accuracy. Similar phenomenon can also
be observed in ResNets. For example  KN achieves 78.3% top-1 accuracy while BN achieves only
77.4% in ResNet101.
A nonnegligible founding is that when compared to BN
in typical-batch training  KN keeps competitive advantage
(76.8% vs 76.4% in ResNet50) while GN is at a disadvan-
tage (75.9% vs 76.4%). This may be attributed to optimiza-
tion efﬁciency of BN  upon which KN (i.e.BKN) is built.

Extra Parameters. In fact  KN introduces only 0.1%×
extra parameters  which is negligible. The extra parameters
include the gain value q that is a scalar  as well as the covariance matrix R  which is a diagonal matrix
(the same as number of channels). The parameters of KN exclude the transition matrix A  because A
is a state transition matrix that is shared with the convolutional ﬁlter in CNNs. An comparison of
parameter numbers is shown in Table 2.

with BN  in terms of the number of samples processed
per second. For a fair comparison  both methods are
trained in the same computing machine with four Titan-
X GPUs. We observe that BN and KN have similar computational costs. The speed of BN is 325.74
examples/sec  which is 1.015× of the speed of KN.

Next we evaluate KN when batch size is small by using different settings  e.g.batch size of 1 and 4.
Batch Size of 4. We employ the baseline
of typical batch size (i.e.32) for compar-
ison. Table 4 reports the results  from
which we have three major observation-
s. First  we obtain an improvement by
replacing BN with KN. For example  in
ResNet50  KN achieves 76.1% top-1 ac-
curacy  outperforming BN and BRN by a large margin (3.4% and 3.4%). Beside  KN is slightly better
than GN (0.3%). This comparison verify the effectiveness of KN in micro-batch training.
Second  we also note that under such setting the validation ac-
curacy of all normalization methods are lower than the baseline
that normalized over batch size of 32 (76.8 vs 76.1 for KN)  and
training converges slowly. However  BN is signiﬁcantly worse
compared to the baseline. This indicates that the micro-batch
training problem is better addressed by using KN than BN.
Third  interestingly we ﬁnd that there is a gain between using
different kinds statistic estimation. In Table 4  we compare t-
wo options including : (A) the population statistics (moving
mean/variance) are used to normalize the layer’s inputs during
inference  and (B) batch sample (online) statistics are used for
normalization during inference. Using online statistics weakens
the superiority of GN over BN. This drives us to re-think the
mechanism of 1-example-batch training (e.g.GN).
Batch Size of 1. We continue to use the above two options. In return  we have two observations
from in Fig. 3 and Table 5. First  in both options KN are signiﬁcantly better than competitors. For
example  using online statistics (B) KN obtains a 2.11% and 2.75% increase compared to BN and
BRN  respectively.
Second  in comparison  using online statistics (B) is sig-
niﬁcantly better than using population statistics (A) . For
example  BKN obtains a top-1 accuracy of 47.99% using
online statistics (B)  while 0.4% using moving means and
variances. Note that this gain is solely due to the usage
of different statistics. We attribute this to two reasons. 1)
All approaches fail to estimate the population statistics for
1-example-batch training. As is discussed in Section 1 
the networks are trained using batch sample statistics  while are tested based on population statistics
appropriated by moving averages. In 1-example-batch training  the information communication never
happens between any two examples. Therefore the moving averages are difﬁcult to represent the
population statistics. One possible solution is to also use the moving averages to normalize the layer
inputs during training  but turns out to be infeasible in [13]. 2) We indeed do not need any population
statistic in the case of 1-example-batch training because it ensures that the activations computed in the
forward pass of training step depend only on a single example  free from the inﬂuence of population
statistics. Even in Table 5 KN has a better performance than competitors  improving 2.11% and

To investigate the application of micro-batch training  we use CO-
CO 2017 detection & segmentation benchmark [6]. We evaluate
ﬁne-tuning the models trained on ImageNet [24] for transferring to
detection and segmentation. These computer vision tasks in general
beneﬁt from higher-resolution input  so the batch size tends to be small
in common practice (1 or 2 images/GPU). As a result  BN degrades
σ (x− µ) + β where µ and β are pre-computed
into a linear layer y = γ
from pre-trained model and frozen  e.g.Mask RCNN [9]. We denote
this as BN*  which in fact performs no normalization during ﬁnetun-
ing. Another substitute is to use the standard BN  but it turns out to be impractical in [34] because of
inaccurate statistic estimation. Therefore we ignore the standard BN.
We experiment on the Mask RCNN baselines [9] using a ResNet50 conv4 backbone. We replace BN*
with KN during ﬁnetuning. The models are trained in the COCO train2017 set and evaluated in the
COCO val2017 set. To accelerate the training  we use the standard fast training setting following the
COCO model zoo. Speciﬁcally  the resolution is set as (800  1333); and we sample 256 boxes for
each image. We use the schedule of 280k training steps. We report the standard COCO metrics of
Average Precision (AP) for bounding box detection (APbbox) and instance segmentation (APmask).
Table 6 shows the comparison of KN vs BN* vs GN. KN improves over BN* by 1.1% box AP
and 1.0% mask AP. This may be contributed to the fact that BN* creates inconsistency between
pre-training and ﬁne-tuning (frozen). We also found GN is 0.6% mask AP worse than KN. Although
GN is also suitable for micro-batch training  its representational power is weaker than KN.

mentation ablation results using

4.3 Analysis on CIFAR10  CIFAR100  and SVHN

We conducted more studies on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 dataset
[15]  both of which consist of 50k training images and 10k testing
images in 100 classes and 10 classes  respectively. We also conduct
experiments on SVHN dataset [20]  which is a real-world digit image
dataset containing over 600 000 labeled data of 10 categories.
4.3.1 Generalized Kalman Normalization Studies

As is pointed out in Sect. 3.3  there are various Kalman Normaliza-
tions  e.g.BKN and GKN. Next we investigate the gain of Kalman
Normalization mechanism compared with the bare BN and GN on
CIFAR10. We use the standard ResNet for CIFAR10 following [8]
with the setting of n = 5. We conduct the experiments in the context
of micro-batch training  i.e.we use batch size of only 2. The results
are reported in Figure 4  where we have three major observations.
First  both BN and GN beneﬁt from Kalman Normalization mech-
anism. For example  BKN has a gain of 1.5% compared with BN 
verifying the effectiveness of BKN (i.e.KN). Second  the gain of
‘BKN - BN’ is larger than ‘GKN - GN’ (1.5% vs 0.4%). This may
be attributed to optimization efﬁciency of BN. Third  Although GN has gains over BN on ImageNet
in micrio-batch training  it has no gain on CIFAR10.

4.3.2 Other Ablation Studies
In this section our focus is on the behaviors of extremely small batch size  but not on pushing the
state-of-the-art results  so we use simple architecture summarized in the following table  where a
fully connected layer with 1 000 output channels is omitted.

tween batch sample variance and moving

Evidence of more accurate statistic estimations. To
show that KN indeed provides a more accurate statistic
estimation than BN  we present two evidences as follows.
First  direct evidence. When the training stage ﬁnished 
we exhaustively forward-propagated all the samples in
CIFAR-10 to obtain their moving statistics and batch sam-
ple statistics. The gaps between batch sample variance and
the moving variance are visualized in Fig. 5 (a) and (b)
for BN and KN  respectively. In Fig. 5 the horizontal axis
represents values of different batches  while vertical axis
represents neurons of different channels. We can observe
values in Fig. 5 (b) are smaller than Fig. 5 (a)  indicating that KN provides a more accurate statistic
estimation  which is consistent with Table 4. This reﬂects the superiority of KN over BN. The
improvement is attributed to two reasons. First  KN enlarges the effective batch size to handle
the micro-batch training by implicitly using the feature maps of all preceding layers (see Sec.3.3).
Therefore it provides a more accurate statistic estimation (i.e.smaller gap between population statistic
and sample statistic). Second  BN treats each hidden layer as an isolated system  the gap between
the population variance and the batch sample variance ampliﬁes as the network becomes deeper.
Differently  KN treats all the layers in a network as a whole system  and estimates the variance of a
certain layer guided by the distributions of its preceding layer. The merits of Kalman Filtering help
eliminate gaps.
Second  indirect evidence. During inference 
there are two ways to calculate the clas-
siﬁcation accuracy  i.e. using the moving
mean/variance or batch mean/variance. Ex-
perimental results in Table 7 show that in KN 
using batch mean/variance achieves the same
Table 7: CIFAR-10 val set  bs = batchsize  Inception.
accuracy as using moving mean/variance. While in BN there’s a gap between using batch variance
and moving variance. This again proves that KN does provide more accurate estimations.
Comparison with BN variants. We compare KN
with more BN variants (e.g.Batch Renorm(BRN)
[12]  Weigth Norm (WN) [25]  Layer Norm (LN) [2]
and Group Norm (GN) [34] ) on CIFAR-10  CIFAR-
100 and SVHN dataset. We have three major ﬁndings
in Table 8. First  KN beats BN and its variants by
large margin on these dataset in micro-batch train-
ing. For example  on CIFAR100 KN has a gain of
3.5%  1.58%  5.3%  20.3% and 1.4% when com-
pared with BN  BRN  WN  LN  and GN  respective-
ly. Second  we can observe that the performance of
the micro-batch training (91.0%  batchsize = 2) is
very encouraging compared to that of the typical size
(92.1%  batchsize = 128). Third  different from GN
that is inferior to BN under the context of typically
large-batch training  KN keeps superiority over the
competitors. These comparisons verify the effective-
ness of KN again.

5 Conclusion

This paper presented a novel normalization method  called Kalman Normalization(KN)  to normalize
the hidden representation of a deep neural network. Unlike previous methods that normalized each
hidden layer independently  KN treats the entire network as a whole. KN can be naturally generalized
to other existing normalization methods to obtain gains. Extensive experiments suggest that KN is
capable of strengthening several state-of-the-art neural networks by improving their training stability
and convergence speed. More importantly  KN can handle the training with mini-batches of very
small sizes.
