Abstract

The Stochastic Block Model (SBM) is a widely used random graph model for
networks with communities. Despite the recent burst of interest in community
detection under the SBM from statistical and computational points of view  there
are still gaps in understanding the fundamental limits of recovery. In this paper 
we consider the SBM in its full generality  where there is no restriction on the
number and sizes of communities or how they grow with the number of nodes  as
well as on the connectivity probabilities inside or across communities. For such
stochastic block models  we provide guarantees for exact recovery via a semidef-
inite program as well as upper and lower bounds on SBM parameters for exact
recoverability. Our results exploit the tradeoffs among the various parameters
of heterogenous SBM and provide recovery guarantees for many new interesting
SBM conﬁgurations.

1 Introduction

A fundamental problem in network science and machine learning is to discover structures in large 
complex networks (e.g.  biological  social  or information networks). Community or cluster detec-
tion underlies many decision tasks  as a basic step that uses pairwise relations between data points
in order to understand more global structures in the data. Applications include recommendation
systems [27]  image segmentation [24  20]  learning gene network structures in bioinformatics  e.g. 
in protein detection [9] and population genetics [17].

In spite of a long history of heuristic algorithms (see  e.g.  [18] for an empirical overview)  as well as
strong research interest in recent years on the theoretical side as brieﬂy reviewed in the sequel  there
are still gaps in understanding the fundamental information theoretic limits of recoverability (i.e.  if
there is enough information to reveal the communities) and computational tractability (if there are
efﬁcient algorithms to recover them). This is particularly true in the case of sparse graphs (that test
the limits of recoverability)  graphs with heterogeneous communities (communities varying greatly
in size and connectivity)  graphs with a number of communities that grows with the number of nodes 
and partially observed graphs (with various observation models).

1.1 Exact Recovery for Heterogenous Stochastic Block Model

The stochastic block model (SBM)  ﬁrst introduced and studied in mathematical sociology by Hol-
land  Laskey and Leinhardt in 1983 [16]  can be described as follows. Consider n vertices partitioned
into r communities V1  V2  . . .   Vr   of sizes n1  n2  . . .   nr. We endow the kth community with an
Erd˝os-Rényi random graph model G(nk  pk) and draw an edge between pairs of nodes in different
communities independently with probability q; i.e.  for any pair of nodes i and j   if i  j ∈ Vk for
some k ∈ {1  . . .   r} we draw an edge with probability pk  and draw an edge with probability q if
they are in different communities. We assume q < mink pk in order for the idea of communities to
make sense. This deﬁnes a distribution over random graphs known as the stochastic block model. In
this paper  we assume the above model while allowing the number of communities to grow with the
number of nodes (similar to [13  15  23]). We refer to this model as the heterogeneous stochastic
block model to contrast our study of this general setting with previous works on special cases of
SBM such as 1) homogenous SBM where the communities are equivalent (they are of the same size
and the connectivity probabilities are equal ) e.g.  [12]  or  2) SBM with linear-sized communities 
where the number of communities is ﬁxed and all community sizes are O(n); e.g.  [1].

1.2 Statistical and Computational Regimes

What we can infer about the community structure from a single draw of the random graph varies
based on the regime of model parameters. Often  the following scenarios are considered.

1. Recovery  where the proportion of misclassiﬁed nodes is negligible; either 0 (corresponding to
exact recovery with strong consistency  and considered in [12  1]) or asymptotically 0 (corre-
sponding to exact recovery with weak consistency as considered in [23  22  28]) as the number of
nodes grows.

2. Approximation  where a ﬁnite fraction (bounded away from 1) of the vertices is recovered. This
regime was ﬁrst introduced in [13  14]  and has been considered in many other works since then;
e.g.  see [15] and references therein.

Both recovery and approximation can be studied from statistical and computational points of view.

Statistically  one can ask about the parameter regimes for which the model can be recovered or ap-
proximated. Such characterizations are specially important when an information-theoretical lower
bound (below which recovery is not possible with high probability) is shown to be achievable with
an algorithm (with high probability)  hence characterizing a phase transition in model parameters.
Recently  there has been signiﬁcant interest in identifying such sharp thresholds for various param-
eter regimes.

Computationally  one might be interested to study algorithms for recovery or approximation. In
the older approach  algorithms were studied to provide upper bounds on the parameter regimes for
recovery or approximation. See [10] or [1  Section 5] for a summary of such results. More recently 
the paradigm has shifted towards understanding the limitations and strengths of tractable methods
(e.g. see [21] on semideﬁnite programming based methods) and assessing whether successful re-
trieval can be achieved by tractable algorithms at the sharp statistical thresholds or there is a gap.
So far  it is understood that there is no such gap in the case of exact recovery (weak and strong)
and approximation of binary SBM as well as the exact recovery of linear-sized communities [1].
However  this is still an open question for more general cases; e.g.  see [2] and the list of unresolved
conjectures therein.

The statistical-computational picture for SBM with only two equivalent communities has been fully
characterized in a series of recent papers. Apart from the binary SBM  the best understood cases are
where there is a ﬁnite number r of equivalent or linear-sized communities. Outside of the settings
described above  the full picture has not yet emerged and many questions are unresolved.

1.3 This paper

The community detection problem studied in this paper is stated as: given the adjacency matrix of
a graph generated by the heterogenous stochastic block model  for what SBM parameters we can
recover the labels of all vertices  with high probability  using an algorithm that has been proved to
do so. We consider a convex program in (2.4) and an estimator similar to the maximum likelihood

2

estimator in (2.5) and characterize parts of the model space for which exact recovery is possible via
these algorithms. Theorems 1 and 2 provide sufﬁcient conditions for the convex recovery program
and Theorem 3 provides sufﬁcient conditions for the modiﬁed maximum likelihood estimator to
exactly recover the underlying model. In Section 2.3  we extend the above bounds to the case of
partial observations  i.e.  when each entry of the matrix is observed uniformly at random with some
probability γ and the results are recorded. We also provide an information-theoretic lower bound 
describing an impossibility regime for exact recovery in heterogenous SBM in Theorem 4. All of
our results only hold with high probability  as this is the best one can hope for; with tiny probability
the model can generate graphs like the complete graph where the partition is unrecoverable.

The results of this paper provide a clear improvement in the understanding of stochastic block mod-
els by exploiting tradeoffs among SBM parameters. We identify a key parameter (or summary
statistic)  deﬁned in (2.1) and referred to as relative density  which shows up in our results and pro-
vides improvements in the statistical assessment and efﬁcient computational approaches for certain
conﬁgurations of heterogenous SBM; examples are given in in Section 3 to illustrate a number of
such beneﬁcial tradeoffs such as

• semideﬁnite programming can successfully recover communities of size O(√log n) under

mild conditions on other communities (see Example 3 for details) while log n has long been
believed to be the threshold for the smallest community size.

• The sizes of the communities can be very spread  or the inter- and intra-community prob-
abilities can be very close  and the model still be efﬁciently recoverable  while existing
methods (e.g.  peeling strategy [3]) providing false negatives.

While these results are a step towards understanding the information-computational picture about
the heterogenous SBM with a growing number of communities  we cannot comment on phase tran-
sitions or a possible information-computational gap (see Section 1.2) in this setup based on the
results of this paper.

2 Main Results

Consider the heterogenous stochastic block model described above. In the proofs  we can allow
for isolated nodes (communities of size 1) which are omitted from the model here to simplify the
presentation. Denote by Y the set of admissible adjacency matrices according to a community
assignment as above  i.e. 

Y := {Y ∈ {0  1}n×n : Y is a valid community matrix w.r.t. V1  . . .   Vr where |Vk| = nk} .

Deﬁne the relative density of community k as

ρk = (pk − q)nk

which can be seen as the increase in the average degree of a node in community k in the SBM 
relative to its average degree in an Erd˝os-Rényi model. Deﬁne nmin and nmax as the minimum
and maximum of n1  . . .   nk respectively. The total variance over the kth community is deﬁned as
σ2
k = nkpk(1 − pk)   and we let σ2

0 = nq(1 − q) . Moreover  consider

(2.2)

A Bernoulli random variable with parameter p is denoted by Ber(p)   and a Binomial random vari-
able with parameters n and p is denoted by Bin(n  p) . The Neyman Chi-square divergence between
the two discrete random variables Ber(p) and Ber(q) is given by

(2.1)

(2.3)

and we have eD(p  q) ≥ DKL(p  q) := DKL(Ber(p)  Ber(q)) . Chi-square divergence is an instance

of a more general family of divergence functions called f -divergences or Ali-Silvey distances. This
family also has KL-divergence  total variation distance  Hellinger distance and Chernoff distance as
special cases. Moreover  the divergence used in [1] is an f -divergence.
Lastly  log denotes the natural logarithm (base e)  and the notation θ & 1 is equivalent to θ ≥ O(1) .

2.1 Convex Recovery

Inspired by the success of semideﬁnite programs in community detection (e.g.  see [15  21]) we
consider a natural convex relaxation of the maximum likelihood estimator  similar to the one used
in [12]  for exact recovery of the heterogeneous SBM with a growing number of communities. As-

suming that ζ =Pr

k is known  we solve

Y

subject to

ˆY = arg max

Pi j Aij Yij
kY k⋆ ≤ n   Pi j Yij = ζ   0 ≤ Yij ≤ 1 .
where k · k⋆ denotes the nuclear norm (the sum of singular values of the matrix).
We prove two theorems giving conditions under which the above convex program outputs the true
community matrix with high probability. In establishing these performance guarantees  we follow
the standard dual certiﬁcate argument in convex analysis while utilizing strong matrix concentra-
tion results from random matrix theory [8  25  26  5]. These results allow us to bound the spectral
radius of the matrix A− E[A] where A is an instance of adjacency matrix generated under heteroge-
nous SBM. The proofs for both theorems along with the matrix concentration bounds are given in
Appendix A.

Theorem 1 Under the heterogenous stochastic block model  the output of the semideﬁnite program

Proof Sketch. For Y ⋆ to be the unique solution of (2.4)  we need to show that for any feasible
Y 6= Y ⋆   the following quantity

hA  Y ⋆ − Y i = hE[A]  Y ⋆ − Y i + hA − E[A]  Y ⋆ − Y i

is strictly positive. In bounding the second term above  we make use of the constraint kY k⋆ ≤ n =
kY ⋆k⋆ by constructing a dual certiﬁcate from A − E[A] . This is where the bounds on the spectral
norm (dual norm for the nuclear norm) of A − E[A] enter and we use matrix concentration bounds
(see Lemma 7 in Appendix A).

The ﬁrst condition of Theorem 1 is equivalent to each community being connected  second condition
ensures that each community is identiﬁable (pmin − q is large enough)  and the third condition
requires minimal density to dominate global variability. The assumption Pr
k = o(1) is
tantamount to saying that the number of tiny communities cannot be too large (e.g.  the number
of polylogarithmic-size communities cannot be a power of n). In other words  one needs to have
mostly large communities (growing like nǫ  for some ǫ > 0) for this assumption to be satisﬁed.
Note  however  that the condition does not restrict the number of communities of size nǫ for any
ﬁxed ǫ > 0 .
In fact  Theorem 1 allows us to describe a regime in which tiny communities of
size O(√log n) are recoverable provided that they are very dense and that only few tiny or small
communities exist; see Example 3. The second theorem imposes more stringent conditions on the
relative density  hence only allowing for communities of size down to log n   but relaxes the condition
that only a small number of nodes can be in small communities.

Theorem 2 Under the heterogenous stochastic block model  the output of the semideﬁnite program

The proof of Theorem 2 is similar to the proof of Theorem 1 except that we use a different matrix
concentration bound (see Lemma 10 in Appendix A).

2.2 Recoverability Lower and Upper Bounds

Next  we consider an estimator  inspired by maximum likelihood estimation  and identify a subset of
the model space which is exactly recoverable via this estimator. The proposed estimation approach

is not computationally tractable and is only used to examine the conditions for which exact recovery
is possible. For a ﬁxed Y ∈ Y and an observed matrix A   the likelihood function is given by

pAij Yij
τ (i j) (1 − pτ (i j))(1−Aij )Yij qAij (1−Yij )(1 − q)(1−Aij )(1−Yij )

where τ : {1  . . .   n}2 → {1  . . .   r} and τ (i  j) = k if and only if i  j ∈ Vk   and arbitrary in
{1  . . .   r} otherwise. The log-likelihood function is given by
log PY (A) =Xi<j
Maximizing the log-likelihood involves maximizing a weighted sum of {Yij}’s where the weights
depend on the (usually unknown) values of q  p1  . . .   pr . To be able to work with less information 
we will use the following modiﬁcation of maximum likelihood estimation  which only uses the
knowledge of n1  . . .   nr

Notice that ρmin = mink=1 ... r nk(pk − q) and pmin = mink=1 ... r pk do not necessarily corre-

for any Y ∈ Y  while this time  we use a counting argument (see Lemma 11 in Appendix B) similar
to the one in [12]. The proofs for this Theorem and the next one are given in Appendix B.

Finally  to provide a better picture of community detection for heterogenous SBM we provide the

following necessary conditions for exact recovery. Notice that Theorems 1 and 2 require eD(q  pk)
(in their ﬁrst condition) and eD(pk  q) (in their second condition) to be bounded from below for

recoverability by the SDP. Similarly  the conditions of Theorem 4 can be seen as average-case and
worst-case upper bounds on these divergences.

2.3 Partial Observations

In the general stochastic block model  we assume that the entries of a symmetric adjacency matrix

A ∈ {0  1}n×n have been generated according to a combination of Erd˝os-Rényi models with pa-
rameters that depend on the true community matrix. In the case of partial observations  we assume
that the entries of A has been observed independently with probability γ . In fact  every entry of
the input matrix falls into one of these categories: observed as one denoted by Ω1  observed as zero
denoted by Ω0  and unobserved which corresponds to Ωc where Ω = Ω0 ∪ Ω1 . If an estimator only

takes the observed part of the matrix as the input  one can revise the underlying probabilistic model
to incorporate both the stochastic block model and the observation model; i.e. a revised distribution
for entries of A as

Aij =(cid:26)Ber(γpk)

Ber(γq)

i  j ∈ Vk for some k
i ∈ Vk and j ∈ Vl for k 6= l .

yields the same output from an estimator that only takes in the observed values. Therefore  the
estimators in (2.4) and (2.5)  as well as the results of Theorems 1  2  3  can be easily adapted to the
case of partially observed graphs. It is worth mentioning that the above model for partially observed
SBM (which is another SBM) is different from another random model known as Censored Block
Model (CBM) [4]. In SBM  absence of an edge provides information  whereas in CBM it does not.

3 Tradeoffs in Heterogenous SBM

As it can be seen from the results presented in this paper  and the main summary statistics they uti-
lize (the relative densities ρ1  . . .   ρr)  the parameters of SBM can vary signiﬁcantly and still satisfy
the same recoverability conditions. In the following  we examine a number of such tradeoffs which
leads to recovery guarantees for interesting SBM conﬁgurations. Here  a conﬁguration is a list of
community sizes nk  their connectivity probabilities pk  and the inter-community connectivity prob-
ability q . A triple (m  p  k) represents k communities of size m each  with connectivity parameter p .
We do not worry about whether m and k are always integers; if they are not  one can always round
up or down as needed so that the total number of vertices is n  without changing the asymptotics.
Moreover  when the O(·) notation is used  we mean that appropriate constants can be determined.
A detailed list of computations for the examples in this section are given in Appendix D.

corresponding example as well as whether  under appropriate regimes of parameters  it would

It is intuitive that using summary statistics such as (pmin  nmin)  for
Better Summary Statistics.
a heterogenous SBM where nk’s and pk’s are allowed to take very different values  can be very
limiting. Examples 1 and 2 are intended to give conﬁgurations that are guaranteed to be recoverable
by our results but fail the existing recoverability conditions in the literature.

Example 1 Suppose we have two communities of sizes n1 = n − √n  n2 = √n  with p1 = n−2/3

and p2 = 1/ log n while q = n−2/3−0.01 . The bound we obtain here in Theorem 3 makes it clear
that this case is theoretically solvable (the modiﬁed maximum likelihood estimator successfully
recovers it). By contrast  Theorem 3.1 in [7] (specialized for the case of no outliers)  requiring

n2

min(pmin − q)2 & (√pminnmin + √nq)2 log n  

(3.1)

would fail and provide no guarantee for recoverability.

Example 2 Consider a conﬁguration as

(n − n2/3  n−1/3+ǫ  1)   (√n  O( 1

log n )  n1/6)   q = n−2/3+3ǫ

where ǫ is a small quantity  e.g.  ǫ = 0.1 . Either of Theorems 1 and 2 certify this case as recoverable
via the semideﬁnite program (2.4) with high probability. By contrast  using the pmin = n−1/3+ǫ and
nmin = √n heuristic  neither the condition of Theorem 3.1 in [7] (given in (3.1)) nor the condition
of Theorem 2.5 in [12] is fulﬁlled  hence providing no recovery guarantee for this conﬁguration.

3.1 Small communities can be efﬁciently recovered

Most algorithms for clustering the SBM run into the problem of small communities [11  6  19] 
often because the models employed do not allow for enough parameter variation to identify the key
quantities involved. The next three examples attempt to provide an idea of how small the community

6

sizes can be  how many small communities are allowed  and how wide the spread of community sizes
can be  as characterized by our results.

Example 3 (smallest community size for convex recovery) Consider a conﬁguration as

(plog n  O(1)  m)   (n2  O( log n

√n )  √n)   q = O( log n
n )

where n2 = √n − mplog n/n to ensure a total of n vertices. Here  we assume m ≤ n/(2√log n)
which implies n2 ≥ √n/2 . It is straightforward to verify the conditions of Theorem 1.

To our knowledge  this is the ﬁrst example in the literature for which semideﬁnite programming
based recovery works and allows the recovery of (a few) communities of size smaller than log n.
Previously  log n was considered to be the standard bound on the community size for exact recovery 
as illustrated by Theorem 2.5 of [12] in the case of equivalent communities. We have thus shown
that it is possible  in the right circumstances (when sizes are spread and the smaller the community
the denser it is)  to recover very small communities (up to √log n size)  if there are just a few of
them (at most polylogarithmic in n). The signiﬁcant improvement we made in the bound on the
size of the smallest community is due to the fact that we were able to perform a closer analysis of
the semideﬁnite program by utilizing stronger matrix concentration bounds  mainly borrowed from
[8  25  26  5]. For more details  see Appendix A.2.

Notice that the condition of Theorem 3 is not satisﬁed. This is not an inconsistency (as Theorem 3
gives only an upper bound for the threshold)  but indicates the limitation of this theorem in charac-
terizing all recoverable cases.

Spreading the sizes. As mentioned before  while Theorem 1 allows for going lower than the stan-
dard log n bound on the community size for exact recovery  it requires the number of very small
communities to be relatively small. On the other hand  Theorem 2 provides us with the option of
having many small communities but requires the smallest community to be of size O(log n) . We
explore two cases with many small communities in the following.

Example 4 Consider a conﬁguration where small communities are dense and there is one big
community

with 0 < ǫ < 1 and 0 < α < β < 1. We are interested to see how large the number of small
communities can be. Then the conditions of Theorems 1 and 2 both require that

ǫ > 2α − β

and are depicted in Figure 1. Since we have not speciﬁed the constants in our results  we only
consider strict inequalities.

The green plane (corresponding to the last condition in (3.2)) comes from controlling the intra-
community interactions uniformly (interested reader is referred to Equations (A.8) and (A.9)
in the supplement material) which might be only an artifact of our proof and can be possibly
improved.

Notice that the small communities are as dense as can be  but the large one is not necessarily very
dense. By picking ǫ to be just over 1/4  we can make α just shy of 1/2  and β very close to 1. As

7

far as we can tell  there are no results in the literature surveyed that cover such a case  although
the clever “peeling” strategy introduced in [3] would recover the largest community. The strongest
result in [3] that seems applicable here is Corollary 4 (which works for non-constant probabilities).
The algorithm in [3] works to recover a large community (larger than O(√n log2 n))  subject to
existence of a gap in the community sizes (roughly  there should be no community sizes between
O(√n) and O(√n log2 n)). Therefore  in this example  after a single iteration  the algorithm will
stop  despite the continued existence of a gap  as there is no community with size above the gap.
Hence the “peeling” strategy on this example would fail to recover all the communities.

Example 5 Consider a conﬁguration with many small dense communities of size log n . We are in-
terested to see how large the spread of community sizes can be for the semideﬁnite program to work.
As required by Theorems 1 and 2 and to control σmax (deﬁned in (2.2))  the larger a community
the smaller its connectivity probability should be; therefore we choose the largest community at the
threshold of connectivity (required for recovery). Consider the community sizes and probabilities:

(log n  O(1)  n/log n − mpn/log n)   (pn log n  O(p(log n)/n)  m)   q = O((log n)/n)

where m is a constant. Again  we round up or down where necessary to make sure the sizes are
integers and the total number of vertices is n. All the conditions of Theorem 2 are satisﬁed and
exact convex recovery is possible via the semideﬁnite program. Note that the last condition of
Theorem 1 is not satisﬁed since there are too many small communities. Also note that alternative
methods proposed in the literature surveyed would not be applicable; in particular  the gap condition
in [3] is not satisﬁed for this case from the start.

3.2 Weak communities are efﬁciently recoverable

The following examples illustrate how small pmin − q can be in order for the recovery  respectively 
the convex recovery algorithms to still be guaranteed to work. When some pk is very close to q  
the Erd˝os-Rényi model G(nk  pk) looks very similar to the ambient edges from G(n  q) . Again  we
are going to exploit the possible tradeoffs in the parameters of SBM to guarantee recovery. Note
that the difference in pmin − q for the two types of recovery is noticeable  indicating that there is a
signiﬁcant difference between what we know to be recoverable and what we can recover efﬁciently
by our convex method. We consider both dense graphs (where pmin is O(1)) and sparse ones.

Example 6 Consider a conﬁguration where all of the probabilities are O(1) and

(n1  pmin  1)   (nmin  p2  1)   (n3  p3  n−n1−nmin

n3

)   q = O(1)

where p2 − q and p3 − q are O(1) . On the other hand  we assume pmin − q = f (n) is small. For
recoverability by Theorem 3  we need f (n) & (log n)/nmin and f 2(n) & (log n)/n1 . Notice that 
since n & n1 & nmin   we should have f (n) &plog n/n . For the convex program to recover this
conﬁguration (by Theorem 1 or 2)  we need nmin & √n and f 2(n) & max{n/n2
1   log n/nmin}  
while all the probabilities are O(1) .
Note that if all the probabilities  as well as pmin − q   are O(1)  then by Theorem 3 all communities
down to a logarithmic size should be recoverable. However  the success of convex recovery is
guaranteed by Theorems 1 and 2 when nmin & √n .
For a similar conﬁguration to Example 6  where the probabilities are not O(1)   recoverability by
Theorem 3 requires f (n) & max{ppmin(log n)/n   n−c} for some appropriate c > 0 .

4 Discussion

We have provided a series of extensions to prior works (especially [12  1]) by considering the exact
recovery for stochastic block model in its full generality with a growing number of communities. By
capturing the tradeoffs among the various parameters of SBM  we have identiﬁed interesting SBM
conﬁgurations that are efﬁciently recoverable via semideﬁnite programs. However there are still
interesting problems that remain open. Sharp thresholds for recovery or approximation of heteroge-
nous SBM  models for partial observation (non-uniform  based on prior information  or adaptive as
in [28])  as well as overlapping communities (e.g.  [1]) are important future directions. Moreover 
other estimators similar to the ones considered in this paper can be analyzed; e.g. when the un-
known parameters in the maximum likelihood estimator  or ζ in (2.4)  are estimated from the given
observations.
