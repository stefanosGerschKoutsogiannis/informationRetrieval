Abstract

It was recently proved using graph covers (Ruozzi  2012) that the Bethe partition
function is upper bounded by the true partition function for a binary pairwise
model that is attractive. Here we provide a new  arguably simpler proof from
ﬁrst principles. We make use of the idea of clamping a variable to a particular
value. For an attractive model  we show that summing over the Bethe partition
functions for each sub-model obtained after clamping any variable can only raise
(and hence improve) the approximation. In fact  we derive a stronger result that
may have other useful implications. Repeatedly clamping until we obtain a model
with no cycles  where the Bethe approximation is exact  yields the result. We also
provide a related lower bound on a broad class of approximate partition functions
of general pairwise multi-label models that depends only on the topology. We
demonstrate that clamping a few wisely chosen variables can be of practical value
by dramatically reducing approximation error.

Introduction

Marginal inference and estimating the partition function for undirected graphical models  also called
Markov random ﬁelds (MRFs)  are fundamental problems in machine learning. Exact solutions may
be obtained via variable elimination or the junction tree method  but unless the treewidth is bounded 
this can take exponential time (Pearl  1988; Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter  1988; Wainwright and
Jordan  2008). Hence  many approximate methods have been developed.
Of particular note is the Bethe approximation  which is widely used via the loopy belief propagation
algorithm (LBP). Though this is typically fast and results are often accurate  in general it may
converge only to a local optimum of the Bethe free energy  or may not converge at all (McEliece
et al.  1998; Murphy et al.  1999). Another drawback is that  until recently  there were no guarantees
on whether the returned approximation to the partition function was higher or lower than the true
value. Both aspects are in contrast to methods such as the tree-reweighted approximation (TRW 
Wainwright et al.  2005)  which features a convex free energy and is guaranteed to return an upper
bound on the true partition function. Nevertheless  empirically  LBP or convergent implementations
of the Bethe approximation often outperform other methods (Meshi et al.  2009; Weller et al.  2014).
Using the method of graph covers (Vontobel  2013)  Ruozzi (2012) recently proved that the optimum
Bethe partition function provides a lower bound for the true value  i.e. ZB ≤ Z  for discrete binary
MRFs with submodular log potential cost functions of any order. Here we provide an alternative
proof for attractive binary pairwise models. Our proof does not rely on any methods of loop series
(Sudderth et al.  2007) or graph covers  but rather builds on fundamental properties of the derivatives
of the Bethe free energy. Our approach applies only to pairwise models (whereas Ruozzi  2012
applies to any order)  but we obtain stronger results for this class  from which ZB ≤ Z easily
follows. We use the idea of clamping a variable and considering the approximate sub-partition
functions over the remaining variables  as the clamped variable takes each of its possible values.
Notation and preliminaries are presented in §2. In §3  we derive a lower bound  not just for the
standard Bethe partition function  but for a range of approximate partition functions over multi-label

variables that may be deﬁned from a variational perspective as an optimization problem  based only
on the topology of the model. In §4  we consider the Bethe approximation for attractive binary pair-
wise models. We show that clamping any variable and summing the Bethe sub-partition functions
over the remaining variables can only increase (hence improve) the approximation. Together with a
similar argument to that used in §3  this proves that ZB ≤ Z for this class of model. To derive the
result  we analyze how the optimum of the Bethe free energy varies as the singleton marginal of one
particular variable is ﬁxed to different values in [0  1]. Remarkably  we show that the negative of this
optimum  less the singleton entropy of the variable  is a convex function of the singleton marginal.
This may have further interesting implications. We present experiments in §5  demonstrating that
clamping even a single variable selected using a simple heuristic can be very beneﬁcial.

1.1 Related work

Branching or conditioning on a variable (or set of variables) and approximating over the remaining
variables has a fruitful history in algorithms such as branch-and-cut (Padberg and Rinaldi  1991;
Mitchell  2002)  work on resolution versus search (Rish and Dechter  2000) and various approaches
of (Darwiche  2009  Chapter 8). Cutset conditioning was discussed by Pearl (1988) and reﬁned by
Peot and Shachter (1991) as a method to render the remaining topology acyclic in preparation for be-
lief propagation. Eaton and Ghahramani (2009) developed this further  introducing the conditioned
belief propagation algorithm together with back-belief-propagation as a way to help identify which
variables to clamp. Liu et al. (2012) discussed feedback message passing for inference in Gaussian
(not discrete) models  deriving strong results for the particular class of attractive models. Choi and
Darwiche (2008) examined methods to approximate the partition function by deleting edges.

2 Preliminaries
We consider a pairwise model with n variables X1  . . .   Xn and graph topology (V E): V contains
nodes {1  . . .   n} where i corresponds to Xi  and E ⊆ V × V contains an edge for each pairwise
relationship. We sometimes consider multi-label models where each variable Xi takes values in
{0  . . .   Li − 1}  and sometimes restrict attention to binary models where Xi ∈ B = {0  1} ∀i.
Let x = (x1  . . .   xn) be a conﬁguration of all the variables  and N (i) be the neighbors of i. For
all analysis of binary models  to be consistent with Welling and Teh (2001) and Weller and Jebara
(2013)  we assume a reparameterization such that p(x) = e−E(x)
  where the energy of a conﬁgura-

2.1 Clamping a variable and related deﬁnitions

We shall ﬁnd it useful to examine sub-partition functions obtained by clamping one particular vari-
able Xi  that is we consider the model on the n− 1 variables X1  . . .   Xi−1  Xi+1  . . .   Xn obtained
by setting Xi equal to one of its possible values.
Let Z|Xi=a be the sub-partition function on the model obtained by setting Xi = a  a ∈ {0  . . .   Li−
1}. Observe that true partition functions and marginals are self-consistent in the following sense:

Li−1(cid:88)

Z =

Z|Xi=j ∀i ∈ V 

p(Xi = a) =

Z|Xi=a
j=0 Z|Xi=j

This is not true in general for approximate forms of inference 1 but if the model has no cycles  then
in many cases of interest  (1) does hold  motivating the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 1. We say an approximation to the log-partition function ZA is ExactOnTrees if it may be
speciﬁed by the variational formula − log ZA = minq∈Q FA(q) where: (1) Q is some compact space
that includes the marginal polytope; (2) FA is a function of the (pseudo-)distribution q (typically a
free energy approximation); and (3) For any model  whenever a subset of variables V(cid:48) ⊆ V is
clamped to particular values P = {pi ∈ {0  . . .   Li − 1}  ∀Xi ∈ V(cid:48)}  i.e. ∀Xi ∈ V(cid:48)  we constrain
Xi = pi  which we write as V(cid:48) ← P   and the remaining induced graph on V \V(cid:48) is acyclic  then the
1For example  consider a single cycle with positive edge weights. This has ZB < Z (Weller et al.  2014) 

yet after clamping any variable  each resulting sub-model is a tree hence the Bethe approximation is exact.

approximation is exact  i.e. ZA|V(cid:48)←P = Z|V(cid:48)←P . Similarly  deﬁne an approximation to be in the
broader class of NotSmallerOnTrees if it satisﬁes all of the above properties except that condition
(3) is relaxed to ZA|V(cid:48)←P ≥ Z|V(cid:48)←P . Note that the Bethe approximation is ExactOnTrees  and
approximations such as TRW are NotSmallerOnTrees  in both cases whether using the marginal
polytope or relaxations thereof  such as the cycle or local polytope (Weller et al.  2014).

We shall derive bounds on ZA with the following idea: (i) Obtain upper or lower bounds on the
approximation achieved by clamping and summing over the approximate sub-partition functions;
(ii) Repeat until an acyclic graph is reached  where the approximation is either exact or bounded.
We introduce the following related concept from graph theory.
Deﬁnition 2. A feedback vertex set (FVS) of a graph is a set of vertices whose removal leaves a
graph without cycles. Determining if there exists a feedback vertex set of a given size is a classical
NP-hard problem (Karp  1972). There is a signiﬁcant literature on determining the minimum cardi-
nality of an FVS of a graph G  which we write as ν(G). Further  if vertices are assigned non-negative
weights  then a natural problem is to ﬁnd an FVS with minimum weight  which we write as νw(G).
An FVS with a factor 2 approximation to νw(G) may be found in time O(|V| + |E| log |E|) (Bafna
et al.  1999). For pairwise multi-label MRFs  we may create a weighted graph from the topology by
assigning each node i a weight of log Li  and then compute the corresponding νw(G).

3 Lower Bound on Approximate Partition Functions
We obtain a lower bound on any approximation that is NotSmallerOnTrees by observing that ZA ≥
ZA|Xn=j ∀j from the deﬁnition (the sub-partition functions optimize over a subset).
Theorem 3. If a pairwise MRF has topology with an FVS of size k and corresponding values
L1  . . .   Lk  then for any approximation that is NotSmallerOnTrees  ZA ≥

A := (cid:80)Lk−1

Proof. We proceed by induction on k. The base case k = 0 holds by the assumption that ZA is NotS-
mallerOnTrees. Now assume the result holds for k−1 and consider a MRF which requires k vertices
to be deleted to become acyclic. Clamp variable Xk at each of its Lk values to create the approx-
j=0 ZA|Xk=j. By the deﬁnition of NotSmallerOnTrees  ZA ≥ ZA|Xk=j ∀j;
imation Z (k)

and by the inductive hypothesis  ZA|Xk=j ≥ Z|Xk =j

By considering an FVS with minimum(cid:81)k

i=1 Li  Theorem 3 is equivalent to the following result.

Theorem 4. For any approximation that is NotSmallerOnTrees  ZA ≥ Ze−νw.
This bound applies to general multi-label models with any pairwise and singleton potentials (no
need for attractive). The bound is trivial for a tree  but already for a binary model with one cycle we
obtain that ZB ≥ Z/2 for any potentials  even over the marginal polytope. The bound is tight  at
least for uniform Li = L ∀i.2 The bound depends only on the vertices that must be deleted to yield
a graph with no cycles  not on the number of cycles (which clearly upper bounds ν(G)). For binary
models  exact inference takes time Θ((|V| − |ν(G)|)2ν(G)). Note that treewidth ≤ ν + 1.

4 Attractive Binary Pairwise Models

In this Section  we restrict attention to the standard Bethe approximation. We shall use results
derived in (Welling and Teh  2001) and (Weller and Jebara  2013)  and adopt similar notation. The
Bethe partition function  ZB  is deﬁned as in Deﬁnition 1  where Q is set as the local polytope
relaxation and FA is the Bethe free energy  given by F(q) = Eq(E)− SB(q)  where E is the energy
2Given ν  we can construct a model such that the bound is tight. For example  in the binary case: consider
a sub-MRF on a cycle with no singleton potentials and uniform  very high attractive edge weights. This can be
shown to have ZB ≈ Z/2 (Weller et al.  2014). Now connect ν of these together in a chain using very weak
edges (this construction is due to N. Ruozzi).

and SB is the Bethe pairwise entropy approximation (see Wainwright and Jordan  2008 for details).
We consider attractive binary pairwise models and apply similar clamping ideas to those used in §3.
In §4.1 we show that clamping can never decrease the approximate Bethe partition function  then
use this result in §4.2 to prove that ZB ≤ Z for this class of model. In deriving the clamping result
of §4.1  in Theorem 7 we show an interesting  stronger result on how the optimum Bethe free energy
changes as the singleton marginal qi is varied over [0  1].

4.1 Clamping a variable can only increase the Bethe partition function

Let ZB be the Bethe partition function for the original model. Clamp variable Xi and form the new
approximation Z (i)

j=0 ZB|Xi=j. In this Section  we shall prove the following Theorem.

B =(cid:80)1

Theorem 5. For an attractive binary pairwise model and any variable Xi  Z (i)

B ≥ ZB.

We ﬁrst introduce notation and derive preliminary results  which build to Theorem 7  our strongest
result  from which Theorem 5 easily follows. Let q = (q1  . . .   qn) be a location in n-dimensional
pseudomarginal space  i.e. qi is the singleton pseudomarginal q(Xi = 1) in the local polytope. Let
F(q) be the Bethe free energy computed at q using Bethe optimum pairwise pseudomarginals given
by the formula for q(Xi = 1  Xj = 1) = ξij(qi  qj  Wij) in (Welling and Teh  2001)  i.e. for an
attractive model  for edge (i  j)  ξij is the lower root of

Let G(q) = −F(q). Note that log ZB = maxq∈[0 1]n G(q). For any x ∈ [0  1]  consider the optimum

maxq∈[0 1]n G(q)  where q∗
To prove Theorem 5  we need a sufﬁciently good upper bound on log ZBi(q∗
i ) compared to
log ZBi(0) and log ZBi(1). First we demonstrate what such a bound could be  then prove that
this holds. Let Si(x) = −x log x − (1 − x) log(1 − x) be the standard singleton entropy.
Lemma 6 (Demonstrating what would be a sufﬁciently good upper bound on log ZB). If ∃x ∈ [0  1]
such that log ZB ≤ x log ZBi(1) + (1 − x) log ZBi(0) + Si(x)  then:
(i) ZBi(0) + ZBi(1) − ZB ≥ emfc(x) where fc(x) = 1 + ec − exc+Si(x) 
m = min(log ZBi(0)  log ZBi(1)) and c = | log ZBi(1) − log ZBi(0)|; and
(ii) ∀x ∈ [0  1]  fc(x) ≥ 0 with equality iff x = σ(c) = 1/(1 + exp(−c))  the sigmoid function.

i is a marginal of Xi at which the global optimum is achieved.

Proof. (i) This follows easily from the assumption. (ii) This is easily checked by differentiating. It
is also given in (Koller and Friedman  2009  Proposition 11.8).

See Figure 6 in the Supplement for example plots of the function fc(x). Lemma 6 motivates us to
consider if perhaps log ZBi(x) might be upper bounded by x log ZBi(1)+(1−x) log ZBi(0)+Si(x) 
i.e.
the linear interpolation between log ZBi(0) and log ZBi(1)  plus the singleton entropy term
Si(x). It is easily seen that this would be true if r∗(qi) were constant. In fact  we shall show that
r∗(qi) varies in a particular way which yields the following  stronger result  which  together with
Lemma 6  will prove Theorem 5.
Theorem 7. Let Ai(qi) = log ZBi(qi) − Si(qi). For an attractive binary pairwise model  Ai(qi) is
a convex function.

Proof. We outline the main points of the proof. Observe that Ai(x) = maxq∈[0 1]n:qi=x G(q) −
Si(x)  where G(q) = −F(q). Note that there may be multiple arg max locations r∗(x). As shown
in (Weller and Jebara  2013)  F is at least thrice differentiable in (0  1)n and all stationary points lie
in the interior (0  1)n. Given our conditions  the ‘envelope theorem’ of (Milgrom  1999  Theorem

4.2 The Bethe partition function lower bounds the true partition function

Theorem 5  together with an argument similar to the proof of Theorem 3  easily yields a new proof
that ZB ≤ Z for an attractive binary pairwise model.
Theorem 10 (ﬁrst proved by Ruozzi  2012). For an attractive binary pairwise model  ZB ≤ Z.

Proof. We shall use induction on k to show that the following statement holds for all k:
If a MRF may be rendered acyclic by deleting k vertices v1  . . .   vk  then ZB ≤ Z.
The base case k = 0 holds since the Bethe approximation is ExactOnTrees. Now assume the result
holds for k−1 and consider a MRF which requires k vertices to be deleted to become acyclic. Clamp

5 Experiments

For an approximation which is ExactOnTrees  it is natural to try clamping a few variables to remove
cycles from the topology. Here we run experiments on binary pairwise models to explore the po-
tential beneﬁt of clamping even just one variable  though the procedure can be repeated. For exact
inference  we used the junction tree algorithm. For approximate inference  we used Frank-Wolfe
(FW  Frank and Wolfe  1956): At each iteration  a tangent hyperplane to the approximate free en-
ergy is computed at the current point  then a move is made to the best computed point along the
line to the vertex of the local polytope with the optimum score on the hyperplane. This proceeds
monotonically  even on a non-convex surface  hence will converge (since it is bounded)  though
it may be only to a local optimum and runtime is not guaranteed. This method typically produces
good solutions in reasonable time compared to other approaches (Belanger et al.  2013; Weller et al. 
2014) and allows direct comparison to earlier results (Meshi et al.  2009; Weller et al.  2014). To
further facilitate comparison  in this Section we use the same unbiased reparameterization used by

Test models were constructed as follows: For n variables  singleton potentials were drawn θi ∼
U [−Tmax  Tmax]; edge weights were drawn Wij ∼ U [0  Wmax] for attractive models  or Wij ∼
U [−Wmax  Wmax] for general models. For models with random edges  we constructed Erd˝os-Renyi
random graphs (rejecting disconnected samples)  where each edge has independent probability p of
being present. To observe the effect of increasing n while maintaining approximately the same
average degree  we examined n = 10  p = 0.5 and n = 50  p = 0.1. We also examined models on
a complete graph topology with 10 variables for comparison with TRW in (Weller et al.  2014). 100
models were generated for each set of parameters with varying Tmax and Wmax values.
Results are displayed in Figures 2 to 4 showing average absolute error of log ZB vs log Z and aver-
age (cid:96)1 error of singleton marginals. The legend indicates the different methods used: Original is FW
on the initial model; then various methods were used to select the variable to clamp  before running
FW on the 2 resulting submodels and combining those results. avg Clamp for log Z means average
over all possible clampings  whereas all Clamp for marginals computes each singleton marginal as
the estimated ˆpi = ZB|Xi=1/(ZB|Xi=0 + ZB|Xi=1). best Clamp uses the variable which with
hindsight gave the best improvement in log Z estimate  thereby showing the best possible result for
log Z. Similarly  worst Clamp picks the variable which showed worst performance. Where one
variable is clamped  the respective marginals are computed thus: for the clamped variable Xi  use
ˆpi as before; for all others  take the weighted average over the estimated Bethe pseudomarginals on
each sub-model using weights 1 − ˆpi and ˆpi for sub-models with Xi = 0 and Xi = 1 respectively.
maxW and Mpower are heuristics to try to pick a good variable in advance. Ideally  we would like
to break heavy cycles  but searching for these is NP-hard. maxW is a simple O(|E|) method which
j∈N (i) |Wij|  and can be seen to perform well (Liu et al.  2012
proposed the same maxW approach for inference in Gaussian models). One way in which maxW
can make a poor selection is to choose a variable at the centre of a large star conﬁguration but far
from any cycle. Mpower attempts to avoid this by considering the convergent series of powers of a
modiﬁed W matrix  but on the examples shown  this did not perform signiﬁcantly better. See §8.1
in the Appendix for more details on Mpower and further experimental results.
FW provides no runtime guarantee when optimizing over a non-convex surface such as the Bethe
free energy  but across all parameters  the average combined runtimes on the two clamped sub-
models was the same order of magnitude as that for the original model  see Figure 5.

6 Discussion
The results of §4 immediately also apply to any binary pairwise model where a subset of variables
may be ﬂipped to yield an attractive model  i.e. where the topology is balanced with no frustrated
cycles (Harary  1953; Weller et al.  2014). For this class  together with the lower bound of §3 
we have sandwiched the range of ZB (equivalently  given ZB  we have sandwiched the range of the
true partition function Z) and bounded its error; further  clamping any variable  solving for optimum
log ZB on sub-models and summing is guaranteed to be more accurate than solving on the original
model. In some cases  it may also be faster; indeed  some algorithms such as LBP may fail on the
original model but perform well on clamped sub-models.
Methods presented may prove useful for analyzing general (non-attractive) models  or for other
applications. As one example  it is known that the Bethe free energy is convex for a MRF whose
topology has at most one cycle (Pakzad and Anantharam  2002). In analyzing the Hessian of the
Bethe free energy  we are able to leverage this to show the following result  which may be useful for
optimization (proof in Appendix; this result was conjectured by N. Ruozzi).
Lemma 11. In a binary pairwise MRF (attractive or repulsive edges  any topology)  for any subset
of variables S ⊆ V whose induced topology contains at most one cycle  the Bethe free energy (using
optimum pairwise marginals) over S  holding variables V\S at ﬁxed singleton marginals  is convex.
In §5  clamping appears to be very helpful  especially for attractive models with low singleton poten-
tials where results are excellent (overcoming TRW’s advantage in this context)  but also for general
models  particularly with the simple maxW selection heuristic. We can observe some decline in
beneﬁt as n grows but this is not surprising when clamping just a single variable. Note  however 
that non-attractive models exist such that clamping and summing over any variable can lead to a
worse Bethe approximation of log Z  see Figure 5c for a simple example on four variables.

It will be interesting to explore the extent to which our results may be generalized beyond binary
pairwise models. Further  it is tempting to speculate that similar results may be found for other
approximations. For example  some methods that upper bound the partition function  such as TRW 
might always yield a lower (hence better) approximation when a variable is clamped.
