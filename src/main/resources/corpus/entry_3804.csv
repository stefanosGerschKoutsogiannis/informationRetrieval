Abstract

Dynamic Bayesian networks have been applied widely to reconstruct the structure
of regulatory processes from time series data. The standard approach is based on
the assumption of a homogeneous Markov chain  which is not valid in many real-
world scenarios. Recent research efforts addressing this shortcoming have con-
sidered undirected graphs  directed graphs for discretized data  or over-ﬂexible
models that lack any information sharing among time series segments.
In the
present article  we propose a non-stationary dynamic Bayesian network for con-
tinuous data  in which parameters are allowed to vary among segments  and in
which a common network structure provides essential information sharing across
segments. Our model is based on a Bayesian multiple change-point process  where
the number and location of the change-points is sampled from the posterior distri-
bution.

Introduction

1
There has recently been considerable interest in structure learning of Bayesian networks. Exam-
ples from the topical ﬁeld of systems biology are the reconstruction of transcriptional regulatory
networks from gene expression data [1]  the inference of signal transduction pathways from pro-
tein concentrations [2]  and the identiﬁcation of neural information ﬂow operating in the brains of
songbirds [3]. In particular  dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) have been applied  as they allow
feedback loops and recurrent regulatory structures to be modelled while avoiding the ambiguity
about edge directions common to static Bayesian networks. The standard assumption underpinning
DBNs is that of stationarity: time-series data are assumed to have been generated from a homoge-
neous Markov process. However  regulatory interactions and signal transduction processes in the
cell are usually adaptive and change in response to external stimuli. Likewise  neural information
ﬂow slowly adapts via Hebbian learning to make the processing of sensory information more ef-
ﬁcient. The assumption of stationarity is therefore too restrictive in many circumstances  and can
potentially lead to erroneous conclusions.

In the recent past  various research efforts have addressed this issue and proposed models that relax
the stationarity assumption. Talih and Hengartner [4] proposed a time-varying Gaussian graphical
model (GGM)  in which the time-varying variance structure of the data was inferred with reversible
jump (RJ) Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). A limitation of this approach is that changes of the
network structure between different segments are restricted to changing at most a single edge  and
the total number of segments is assumed known a priori. Xuan and Murphy [5] developed a related
non-stationary GGM based on a product partition model. The method allows for separate structures

in different segments  where the number of structures is inferred from the data. The inference
algorithm iterates between a convex optimization for determining the graph structure and a dynamic
programming algorithm for calculating the segmentation. The latter aspect imposes restrictions on
the graph structure (decomposability)  though. Moreover  both the models of [4] and [5] are based
on undirected graphs  whereas most processes in systems biology  like neural information ﬂow 
signal transduction and transcriptional regulation  are intrinsically of a directed nature. To address
this shortcoming  Robinson and Hartemink [6] and L´ebre [7] proposed a non-stationary dynamic
Bayesian network. Both methods allow for different network structures in different segments of the
time series  where the location of the change-points and the total number of segments are inferred
from the data with RJMCMC. The essential difference between the two methods is that the model
proposed in [6] is a non-stationary version of the BDe score [8]  which requires the data to be
discretized. The method proposed in [7] is based on the Bayesian linear regression model of [9] 
which avoids the need for data discretization.

Allowing the network structure to change between segments leads to a highly ﬂexible model. How-
ever  this approach faces a conceptual and a practical problem. The practical problem is potential
model over-ﬂexibility1. Owing to the high costs of postgenomic high-throughput experiments  time
series in systems biology are typically rather short. Modelling short time series segments with sep-
arate network structures will almost inevitably lead to inﬂated inference uncertainty  which calls
for some information sharing between the segments. The conceptual problem is related to the very
premise of a ﬂexible network structure. This assumption is reasonable for some scenarios  like mor-
phogenesis  where the different segments are e.g. associated with the embryonic  larval  pupal  and
adult stages of fruit ﬂy (as discussed in [6]). However  for most cellular processes on a shorter time
scale  it is questionable whether it is the structure rather than just the strength of the regulatory in-
teractions that changes with time. To use the analogy of the trafﬁc ﬂow network invoked in [6]: it
is not the road system (the network structure) that changes between off-peak and rush hours  but the
intensity of the trafﬁc ﬂow (the strength of the interactions). In the same vein  it is not the ability of
a transcription factor to potentially bind to the promoter of a gene and thereby initiate transcription
(the interaction structure)  but the extent to which this happens (the interaction strength).

The objective of the present work is to propose and assess a non-stationary continuous-valued DBN
that introduces information sharing among different time series segments via a constrained structure.
Our model is non-stationary with respect to the parameters  while the network structure is kept ﬁxed
among segments. Our model complements the one proposed in [6] in two other aspects: the score
is a non-stationary generalization of the BGe [10] rather than the BDe score  thus avoiding the need
for data discretization  and the patterns of non-stationarity are node-speciﬁc  thereby providing extra
model ﬂexibility. Our work is based on [11]  [12]  and [13]. Like [11]  our model is effectively a
mixture of BGe models. We replace the free allocation model of [11] by a change-point process
to incorporate our prior notion that adjacent time points in a time series are likely to be governed
by similar distributions. We borrow from [12] the concept of node-speciﬁc change-points to enable
greater model ﬂexibility. However  as opposed to [12]  we do not approximate the scoring function
by BIC [14]  but compute the proper marginal likelihood. The objective of inference is to infer the

of how our method is related to various recently published related models is provided in Table 1.

2 Methodology

2.1 The dynamic BGe network

DBNs are ﬂexible models for representing probabilistic relationships between interacting variables
(nodes) X1  . . .   XN via a directed graph G. An edge pointing from Xi to Xj indicates that the
realization of Xj at time point t  symbolically: Xj(t)  is conditionally dependent on the realization
of Xi at time point t−1  symbolically: Xi(t−1). The parent node set of node Xn in G  πn = πn(G) 
is the set of all nodes from which an edge points to node Xn in G. Given a data set D  where Dn t
and D(πn t) are the tth realizations Xn(t) and πn(t) of Xn and πn  respectively  and 1 ≤ t ≤ m
represents time  DBNs are based on the following homogeneous Markov chain expansion:

P (D|G  θ) =

N

m

Yn=1

Yt=2

P(cid:16)Xn(t) = Dn t|πn(t − 1) = D(πn t−1)  θn(cid:17)

(1)

where θ is the total parameter vector  composed of node-speciﬁc subvectors θn  which specify
the local conditional distributions in the factorization. From Eq. (1) and under the assumption of

parameter independence  P (θ|G) =Qn P (θn|G)  the marginal likelihood is given by

and parent set πn. We choose a linear Gaussian distribution for the local conditional distribution
P (Xn|πn  θn) in Eq.(1). Under fairly weak regularity conditions discussed in [10] (parameter mod-
ularity and conjugacy of the prior2)  the integral in Eq. (3) has a closed form solution  given by
Eq. (24) in [10]. The resulting expression is called the BGe score3.

2.2 The non-stationary dynamic change-point BGe model (cpBGe)

To obtain a non-stationary DBN  we generalize Eq. (1) with a node-speciﬁc mixture model:

where δVn(t) k is the Kronecker delta  V is a matrix of latent variables Vn(t)  Vn(t) = k indicates
that the realization of node Xn at time t  Xn(t)  has been generated by the kth component of a
mixture with Kn components  and K = (K1  . . .   Kn). Note that the matrix V divides the data
into several disjoined subsets  each of which can be regarded as pertaining to a separate BGe model
with parameters θk
n. The vectors Vn are node-speciﬁc  i.e. different nodes can have different break-
points. The probability model deﬁned in Eq.(4) is effectively a mixture model with local probability
distributions P (Xn|πn  θk
n) and it can hence  under a free allocation of the latent variables  approx-
imate any probability distribution arbitrarily closely. In the present work  we change the assignment
of data points to mixture components from a free allocation to a change-point process. This effec-
tively reduces the complexity of the latent variable space and incorporates our prior belief that  in a

2The conjugate prior is a normal-Wishart distribution. For the present study  we chose the hyperparameters

of this distribution maximally uninformative subject to the regularity conditions discussed in [10].

3The score equivalence aspect of the BGe model is not required for DBNs  because edge reversals are not
permissible. However  formulating our method in terms of the BGe score is advantageous when adapting the
proposed framework to non-linear static Bayesian networks along the lines of [12].

marginal likelihood conditional on the latent variables V is given by

Eq. (6) is similar to Eq. (3)  except

[10] are satisﬁed  then the expression in Eq.(6) has a closed-form solution: it is given by Eq. (24) in
[10] restricted to the subset of the data that has been assigned to the kth mixture component (or kth
segment). The joint probability distribution of the proposed cpBGe model is given by:

In the absence of genuine prior knowledge about the regulatory network structure  we assume for
P (G) a uniform distribution on graphs  subject to a fan-in restriction of |πn| ≤ 3. As prior prob-
ability distributions on the node-speciﬁc numbers of mixture components Kn  P (Kn)  we take iid
truncated Poisson distributions with shape parameter λ = 1  restricted to 1 ≤ Kn ≤ KM AX
(we set KM AX = 10 in our simulations). The prior distribution on the latent variable vectors 
n=1{P (Vn|Kn)  is implicitly deﬁned via the change-point process as follows. We
identify Kn with Kn − 1 change-points bn = {bn 1  . . .   bn Kn−1} on the continuous interval [2  m].
For notational convenience we introduce the pseudo change-points bn 0 = 2 and bn Kn = m. For
node Xn the observation at time point t is assigned to the kth component  symbolically Vn(t) = k 
if bn k−1 ≤ t < bn k. Following [15] we assume that the change-points are distributed as the even-
numbered order statistics of L := 2(Kn − 1) + 1 points u1  . . .   uL uniformly and independently
distributed on the interval [2  m]. The motivation for this prior  instead of taking Kn uniformly
distributed points  is to encourage a priori an equal spacing between the change-points  i.e.
to
discourage mixture components (i.e. segments) that contain only a few observations. The even-
numbered order statistics prior on the change-point locations bn induces a prior distribution on the
node-speciﬁc allocation vectors Vn. Deriving a closed-form expression is involved. However  the
MCMC scheme we discuss in the next section does not sample Vn directly  but is based on local
modiﬁcations of Vn based on birth  death and reallocation moves. All that is required for the ac-
ceptance probabilities of these moves are P (Vn|Kn) ratios  which are straightforward to compute.

2.3 MCMC inference

We now describe an MCMC algorithm to obtain a sample {Gi  Vi  Ki}i=1 ... I from the posterior
distribution P (G  V  K|D) ∝ P (G  V  K  D) of Eq. (7). We combine the structure MCMC algo-
rithm4 [17  18] with the change-point model used in [15]  and draw on the fact that conditional on
the allocation vectors V  the model parameters can be integrated out to obtain the marginal like-
n [k  Vn]  G) in closed form  as shown in the previous section. Note that this
lihood terms Ψ(Dπn
approach is equivalent to the idea underlying the allocation sampler proposed in [13]. The resulting
algorithm is effectively an RJMCMC scheme [15] in the discrete space of network structures and
latent allocation vectors  where the Jacobian in the acceptance criterion is always 1 and can be omit-
ted. With probability pG = 0.5 we perform a structure MCMC move on the current graph Gi and
leave the latent variable matrix and the numbers of mixture components unchanged  symbolically:
Vi+1 = Vi and Ki+1 = Ki. A new candidate graph Gi+1 is randomly drawn out of the set of
graphs N (Gi) that can be reached from the current graph Gi by deletion or addition of a single edge.
The proposed graph Gi+1 is accepted with probability:

A(Gi+1|Gi) = min(cid:26)1 

P (D|Gi+1  Vi  Ki)
P (D|Gi  Vi  Ki)

P (Gi+1)
P (Gi)

|N (Gi)|

|N (Gi+1)|(cid:27)

(8)

4An MCMC algorithm based on Eq.(10) in [16] is computationally less efﬁcient than when applied to static
Bayesian networks or stationary DBNs  since the local scores would have to be re-computed every time the
positions of the change-points change.

3 Results on synthetic data
To assess the performance of the proposed model  we applied it to a set of synthetic data generated
from different networks  as shown in Figure 1. The structures in Figure panels 1a-c constitute
elementary network motifs  as studied e.g. in [20]. The network in Figure 1d was extracted from
the systems biology literature [2] and represents a well-studied protein signal transduction pathway.
We added an extra feedback loop on the root node to allow the generation of a Markov chain with
non-zero autocorrelation; note that this modiﬁcation is not biologically implausible [21].

We generated data with a mixture of piece-wise linear processes and sinusoidal transfer functions.
The advantage of the ﬁrst approach is the exact knowledge of the true process change-points; the
second approach is more realistic (smooth function) with a stronger mismatch between model and
data-generation mechanism. For example  the network in Figure 1c was modelled as

X(t + 1) = φX (t);

Y (t + 1) = φY (t); W (t + 1) = W (t) +

Z(t + 1) = cX · X(t) + cY · Y (t) + ·sin(W (t)) + cZ · φZ(t + 1)

where the φ.(.) are iid standard Normally distributed. We employed different values cX = cY ∈
{0.25  0.5} and cZ  cW ∈ {0.25  0.5  1} to vary the signal-to-noise ratio and the amount of au-
tocorrelation in W . For each parameter conﬁguration  25 time series with 41 time points where
independently generated. For the other networks  data were generated in a similar way. Owing
to space restrictions  the complete model speciﬁcations have to be relegated to the supplementary
material.

of Figure 1. The horizontal axis in each panel represents the proposed cpBGe model. The vertical
axis represents the following competing models: BDe (△)  BGe (⊔)  the method of Ko et al. [12]
((cid:13))  and the method of Grzegorczyk et al. [11] (⋆)  adapted as described in the text. Different sym-
bols of the same shape correspond to different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and autocorrelation times
(ACT). Each symbol shows a comparison of two average AUC scores  averaged over 25 (panels a-
c) or 5 (panel d) time series independently generated for a given SNR/ACT setting. The diagonal
line indicates equal performance; symbols below this lines indicate that the proposed cpBGe model
outperforms the competing model. The table in the bottom shows an overview of the corresponding
p-values obtained from a two-sided paired t-test with Bonferroni correction. For all but three cases
the cpBGe model outperforms the competing model at the standard 5% signiﬁcance level.

To each data set  we applied the proposed cpBGe model as described in Section 2. We compared its
performance with four alternative schemes. We chose the classical stationary DBNs based on BDe
[8] and BGe [10]. Note that for these models the parameters can be integrated out analytically  and
only the network structure has to be learned. The latter was sampled from the posterior distribution
with structure MCMC [17  18]. Note that the BDe model requires discretized data  which we ef-
fected with the information bottleneck algorithm [22]. Our comparative evaluation also included two
non-linear/non-stationary models with a clearly deﬁned network structure (for the sake of compara-
bility with our approach). We chose the method of Ko et al. [12] for its ﬂexibility and comparative
ease of implementation. The inference scheme is based on the application of the EM algorithm [23]
to a node-speciﬁc mixture model subject to a BIC penalty term [14]. We implemented this algorithm
according to the authors’ speciﬁcation in MATLAB c(cid:13)  using the software package NETLAB [24].
We also compared our model with the approach proposed by Grzegorczyk et al. [11]. We applied the
software available from the authors’ website. We replaced the authors’ free allocation model by the
change-point process used for our model. This was motivated by the fact that for a fair comparison 
the same prior knowledge about the data structure (time series) should be used. In all other aspects
we applied the method as described in [11]. All MCMC simulations were divided into a burn-in and
a sampling phase  where the length of the burn-in phase was chosen such that standard convergence
criteria based on potential scale reduction factors [25] were met. The software implementations of
all methods used in our study are available upon request. For lack of space  further details have to
be relegated to the supplementary material.

To assess the network reconstruction accuracy  various criteria have been proposed in the litera-
ture. In the present study  we chose receiver-operator-characteristic (ROC) curves computed from
the marginal posterior probabilities of the edges (and the ranking thereby induced). Owing to the
large number of simulations – for each network and parameter setting the simulations were repeated
on 25 (Figures 2a-c) or 5 (Figures 2d) independently generated time series – we summarized the
performance by the area under the curve (AUC)  ranging between 0.5 (expected random predictor)
to 1.0 (perfect predictor). The results are shown in Figure 2 and suggest that the proposed cpBGe
model tends to signiﬁcantly outperform the competing models. A more detailed analysis with an

4 Results on Arabidopsis gene expression time series
We have applied our method to microarray gene expression time series related to the study of cir-
cadian regulation in plants. Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings  grown under artiﬁcially controlled Te-
hour-light/Te-hour-dark cycles  were transferred to constant light and harvested at 13 time points in
τ -hour intervals. From these seedlings  RNA was extracted and assayed on Affymetrix GeneChip
oligonucleotide arrays. The data were background-corrected and normalized according to standard
procedures5  using the GeneSpring c(cid:13) software (Agilent Technologies). We combined four time se-
ries  which differed with respect to the pre-experiment entrainment condition and the time intervals:
Te ∈ {10h  12h  14h}  and τ ∈ {2h  4h}. The data  with detailed information about the experi-
mental protocols  can be obtained from [27]  [11]  and [28]. We focused our analysis on 9 circadian
genes6 (i.e. genes involved in circadian regulation). We combined all four time series into a single
set. The objective was to test whether the proposed cpBGe model would detect the different experi-
mental phases. Since the gene expression values at the ﬁrst time point of a time series segment have
no relation with the expression values at the last time point of the preceding segment  the corre-
sponding boundary time points were appropriately removed from the data7. This ensures that for all
pairs of consecutive time points a proper conditional dependence relation determined by the nature
of the regulatory cellular processes is given. The top panel of Figure 3 shows the marginal posterior

It is seen that the three concatenation points are clearly detected. There is a slight difference between
the heights of the posterior probability peaks for LHY and TOC1. This behaviour is also captured by
the co-allocation matrices in the bottom row of Figure 3. This deviation indicates that the two genes
are effected by the changing experimental conditions (entrainment  time interval) in different ways
and thus provides a useful tool for further exploratory analysis. The bottom right panel of Figure 3
shows the gene interaction network that is predicted when keeping all edges with marginal posterior
probability above 0.5. There are two groups of genes. Empty circles in the ﬁgure represent morning
genes (i.e. genes whose expression peaks in the morning)  shaded circles represent evening genes
(i.e. genes whose expression peaks in the evening). There are several directed edges pointing from
the group of morning genes to the evening genes  mostly originating from gene CCA1. This result
is consistent with the ﬁndings in [29]  where the morning genes were found to activate the evening
genes  with CCA1 being a central regulator. Our reconstructed network also contains edges pointing
into the opposite direction  from the evening genes back to the morning genes. This ﬁnding is also
consistent with [29]  where the evening genes were found to inhibit the morning genes via a negative
feedback loop. In the reconstructed network  the connectivity within the group of evening genes is
sparser than within the group of morning genes. This ﬁnding is consistent with the fact that follow-
ing the light-dark cycle entrainment  the experiments were carried out in constant-light condition 
resulting in a higher activity of the morning genes overall. Within the group of evening genes  the
reconstructed network contains an edge between GI and TOC1. This interaction has been conﬁrmed
in [30]. Hence while a proper evaluation of the reconstruction accuracy is currently unfeasible –
like [6] and many related studies  we lack a gold-standard owing to the unknown nature of the true
interaction network – our study suggests that the essential features of the reconstructed network are
biologically plausible and consistent with the literature.

5 Discussion

We have proposed a continuous-valued non-stationary dynamic Bayesian network  which constitutes
a non-stationary generalization of the BGe model. This complements the work of [6]  where a
non-stationary BDe model was proposed. We have argued that a ﬂexible network structure can
lead to practical and conceptual problems  and we therefore only allow the parameters to vary
with time. We have presented a comparative evaluation of the network reconstruction accuracy
on synthetic data. Note that such a study is missing from recent related studies on this topic  like [6]
and [7]  presumably because their overall network structure is not properly deﬁned. Our ﬁndings
suggest that the proposed non-stationary BGe model achieves a clear performance improvement
over the classical stationary models BDe and BGe as well as over the non-linear/non-stationary
models of [12] and [11]. The application of our model to gene expression time series from circadian
clock-regulated genes in Arabidopsis thaliana has led to a plausible data segmentation  and the
reconstructed network shows features that are consistent with the biological literature.

The proposed model is based on a multiple change-point process. This scheme provides the ap-
proximation of a non-linear regulation process by a piecewise linear process under the assumption
that the temporal processes are sufﬁciently smooth. A straightforward modiﬁcation would be the
replacement of the change-point process by the allocation model of [13] and [11]. This modiﬁcation
would result in a fully-ﬂexible mixture model  which is preferable if the smoothness assumption for
the temporal processes is violated. It would also provide a non-linear Bayesian network for static
rather than time series data. While the algorithmic implementation is straightforward  the increased
complexity of the latent variable conﬁguration space would introduce additional challenges for the
mixing and convergence properties of the MCMC sampler. The development of more effective pro-
posal moves  as well as a comparison with alternative non-linear Bayesian network models  like
[31]  is a promising subject for future research.
