Abstract 

Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) at the early stage of the disease development is of great 
clinical importance. Current clinical assessment that relies primarily on cognitive measures proves 
low  sensitivity  and  specificity.  The  fast  growing  neuroimaging  techniques  hold  great  promise. 
Research so far has focused on single neuroimaging modality. However  as different modalities 
provide complementary measures for the same disease pathology  fusion of multi-modality data 
may  increase  the  statistical  power  in  identification  of  disease-related  brain  regions.  This  is 
especially true for early AD  at which stage the disease-related regions are most likely to be weak-
effect regions that are difficult to be detected from a single modality alone. We propose a sparse 
composite linear discriminant analysis model (SCLDA) for identification of disease-related brain 
regions of early AD from multi-modality data. SCLDA uses a novel formulation that decomposes 
each LDA parameter into a product of a common parameter shared by all the modalities and a 
parameter  specific  to  each  modality   which  enables  joint  analysis  of  all  the  modalities  and 
borrowing strength from one another. We prove that this formulation is equivalent to a penalized 
likelihood with non-convex regularization  which can be solved by the DC (difference of convex 
functions) programming. We show that in using the DC programming  the property of the non-
convex  regularization  in  terms  of  preserving  weak-effect  features  can  be  nicely  revealed.  We 
perform extensive simulations to show that SCLDA outperforms existing competing algorithms on 
feature selection  especially on the ability for identifying weak-effect features. We apply SCLDA 
to the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images of 
49 AD patients and 67 normal controls (NC). Our study identifies disease-related brain regions 
consistent with findings in the AD literature.

Alzheimer’s  disease  (AD)  is  a  fatal   neurodegenerative  disorder  that  currently  affects  over  five 
million people in the U.S. It leads to substantial  progressive neuron damage that is irreversible  
which  eventually  causes  death.    Early  diagnosis  of  AD  is  of  great  clinical  importance   because 
disease-modifying therapies given to patients at the early stage of their disease development will 
have  a  much  better  effect  in  slowing  down  the  disease  progression  and  helping  preserve  some 
cognitive  functions  of  the  brain.  However   current  clinical  assessment  that  majorly  relies  on 
cognitive measures proves low sensitivity and specificity in early diagnosis of AD. This is because 
these  cognitive  measures  are  vulnerable  to  the  confounding  effect  from  some  non-AD  related 
factors  such  as  patients’  mood   and  presence  of  other  illnesses  or  major  life  events  [1].  The 
confounding  effect  is  especially  severe  in  the  diagnosis  of  early  AD   at  which  time  cognitive

impairment is not yet apparent. On the other hand  fast growing neuroimaging techniques  such as 
Magnetic  Resonance  Imaging  (MRI)  and  Positron  Emission  Tomography  (PET)   provide  great 
opportunities  for  improving  early  diagnosis  of  AD   due  to  their  ability  for  overcoming  the 
limitations of conventional cognitive measures. There are two major categories of neuroimaging 
techniques  i.e.  functional and structure neuroimaging. MRI is a typical structural neuroimaging 
technique   which  allows  for  visualization  of  brain  anatomy.  PET  is  a  typical  functional 
neuroimaging technique  which measures the cerebral metabolic rate for glucose. Both techniques 
have  been  extensively  applied  to  AD  studies.  For  example   studies  based  on  MRI  have 
consistently  revealed  brain  atrophy  that  involves  the  hippocampus  and  entorhinal  cortex  [2-6]; 
studies based on PET have revealed functional abnormality that involves the posterior temporal 
and  parietal  association  cortices  [8-10]   posterior  cingulate   precuneus   and  medial  temporal 
cortices [11-14].  
There  is  overlap  between  the  disease-related  brain  regions  detected  by  MRI  and  those  by  PET  
such  as  regions  in  the  hippocampus  area  and  the  mesia  temporal  lobe  [15-17].  This  is  not 
surprising since MRI and PET are two complementary measures for the same disease pathology  
i.e.   it  starts  mainly  in  the  hippocampus  and  entorhinal  cortex   and  subsequently  spreads 
throughout  temporal  and  orbiogrontal  cortext   poseterior  cingulated   and  association  cortex  [7]. 
However  most existing studies only exploited structural and functional alterations in separation  
which  ignore  the  potential  interaction  between  them.  The  fusion  of  MRI  and  PET  imaging 
modalities  will  increase  the  statistical  power  in  identification  of  disease-related  brain  regions  
especially  for  early  AD   at  which  stage  the  disease-related  regions  are  most  likely  to  be  weak-
effect regions that are difficult to be detected from MRI or PET alone. Once a good set of disease-
related brain regions is identified  they can be further used to build an effective classifier (i.e.  a 
biomarker  from  the  clinical  perspective)  to  enable  AD  diagnose  with  high  sensitivity  and 
specificity.  
The  idea  of  multi-modality  data  fusion  in  the  research  of  neurodegenerative  disorders  has  been 
exploited  before.  For  example   a  number  of  models  have  been  proposed  to  combine 
electroencephalography  (EEG)  and  functional  MRI  (fMRI)   including  parallel  EEG-fMRI 
independent  component  analysis  [18]-[19]   EEG-informed  fMRI  analysis  [18]  [20]   and 
variational Bayesian methods [18] [21]. The purpose of these studies is different from ours  i.e.  
they  aim  to  combine  EEG   which  has  high  temporal  resolution  but  low  spatial  resolution   and 
fMRI  which has low temporal resolution but high spatial resolution  so as to obtain an accurate 
picture for the whole brain with both high spatial and high temporal resolutions [18]-[21]. Also  
there have been some studies that include both MRI and PET data for classification [15]  [22]-
[25].  However   these  studies  do  not  make  use  of  the  fact  that  MRI  and  PET  measure  the  same 
underlying disease pathology from two complementary perspectives (i.e.  structural and functional 
perspectives)  so that the analysis of one imaging modality can borrow strength from the other.  
In  this  paper   we  focus  on  the  problem  of  identifying  disease-related  brain  regions  from  multi-
modality data. This is actually a variable selection problem. Because MRI and PET data are high-
dimensional  regularization techniques are needed for effective variable selection  such as the L1-
regularization  technique  [25]-[30]  and  the  L2/L1-regularization  technique  [31].  In  particular  
L2/L1-regularization has been used for variable selection jointly on multiple related datasets  also 
known as multitask feature selection [31]  which has a similar nature to our problem. Note that 
both L1- and L2/L1-regularizations are convex regularizations  which have gained them popularity 
in the literature. On the other hand  there is increasing evidence that these convex regularizations 
tend 
these  convex 
regularizations could lead to miss-identification of the weak-effect disease-related brain regions  
which unfortunately make up a large portion of the disease-related brain regions especially in early 
AD. Also  convex regularizations tend to select many irrelevant variables to compensate for the 
overly severe shrinkage in the parameters of the relevant variables. Considering these limitations 
of  convex  regularizations   we  study  non-convex  regularizations  [33]-[35]  [39]   which  have  the 
advantage  of  producing  mildly  or  slightly  shrunken  parameter  estimates  so  as  to  be  able  to 
preserve weak-effect disease-related brain regions and the advantage of avoiding selecting many 
disease-irrelevant regions.  
Specifically  in  this  paper   we  propose  a  sparse  composite  linear  discriminant  analysis  model  
called SCLDA  for identification of disease-related brain regions from multi-modality data. The 
contributions of our paper include: 

too  severely  shrunken  parameter  estimates.  Therefore

•  Formulation: We propose a novel formulation that decomposes each LDA parameter into a 
product  of  a  common  parameter  shared  by  all  the  data  sources  and  a  parameter  specific  to 
each data source  which enables joint analysis of all the data sources and borrowing strength 
from  one  another.  We  further  prove  that  this  formulation  is  equivalent  to  a  penalized 
likelihood with non-convex regularization.  

•  Algorithm: We show that the proposed non-convex optimization can be solved by the DC 
(difference of convex functions) programming [39]. More importantly  we show that in using 
the DC programming  the property of the non-convex regularization in terms of preserving 
weak-effect features can be nicely revealed. 

•  Application: We apply the proposed SCLDA to the PET and MRI data of early AD patients 
and  normal  controls  (NC).  Our  study  identifies  disease-related  brain  regions  that  are 
consistent  with  the  findings  in  the  AD  literature.  AD  vs.  NC  classification  based  on  these 
identified regions achieves high accuracy  which makes the proposed method a useful tool for 
clinical diagnosis of early AD. In contrast  the convex-regularization based multitask feature 
selection method [31] identifies more irrelevant brain regions and yields a lower classification 
accuracy.

The objective of LDA is to seek for a 𝑝×𝑞 linear transformation matrix  𝛉!   with which  𝛉!!𝑍 
retains the maximum amount of class discrimination information in 𝑍. To achieve this objective  
one approach is to seek for the 𝛉!  that maximizes the between-class variance of 𝛉!!𝑍  which can 
be measured by tr(𝛉!!𝐓𝛉!)   while minimizing the within-class variance of 𝛉!!𝑍  which  can be 
measured by tr(𝛉!!𝐖𝛉!). Here tr() is the matrix trace operator. This is equivalent to solving the

Note that 𝛉!  corresponds to the right eigenvector of 𝐖!!𝐓 and 𝑞=𝐽−1. 
Another  approach  used  for  finding  the 𝛉!   is  to  use  the  maximum  likelihood  estimation  for 
common covariance matrix  and their mean differences lie in a 𝑞-dimensional subspace of the 𝑝-

Gaussian populations that have different means and a common covariance matrix. Specifically  as 
in  [36]   this  approach  is  developed  by  assuming  the  class  distributions  are  Gaussian  with  a 

following optimization problem: 

dimensional  original  variable  space.  Hastie  [37]  further  generalized  this  approach  by  assuming 
that class distributions are a mixture of Gaussians  which has more flexibility than LDA. However  
both  approaches  assume  a  common  covariance  matrix  for  all  the  classes   which  is  too  strict  in 
many  practical  applications   especially  in  high-dimensional  problems  where  the  covariance 
matrices of different classes tend to be different. Consequently  the linear transformation explored 
by LDA may not be effective.  
In [38]  a heterogeneous LDA (HLDA) is developed to relax this assumption. The HLDA seeks 

for  a 𝑝×𝑝  linear  transformation  matrix  𝛉   in  which  only  the  first 𝑞  columns  (𝛉! )  contain 
discrimination  information  and  the  remaining 𝑝−𝑞  columns  (𝛉!!!)  contain  no  discrimination 

information. For Gaussian models  assuming lack of discrimination information is equivalent to 
assuming that the means and the covariance matrices of the class distributions are the same for all

information in 𝐙! . A naive way for estimating 𝚯= 𝛉! 𝛉! … 𝛉!  is to separately estimate 
each 𝛉!  based on 𝐙! . Apparently  this approach does not take advantage of the fact that all the

Here  𝛿! represents the common information shared by all the data sources about variable 𝑘  while 
𝛾! !!  represents the specific information only captured by the 𝑚!! data source. For example  for 
disease-related  brain  region  identification   if 𝛿!=0   it  means  that  all  the  data  sources  indicate

columns containing discrimination information) to be sparse  by imposing the L1-penalty on 𝚪 and 
𝚿. By doing so  we obtain the following optimization problem for the proposed SCLDA:

The proof can be found in the supplementary document. It can also be found in the supplementary 
material  how  this  formulation  will  serve  the  purpose  of  the  composite  parameterization   i.e.  
common information and specific information can be estimated separately and simultaneously.  
The optimization problem (5) is a non-convex optimization problem that is difficult to solve. We 
address this problem by using an iterative two-stage procedure known as Difference of Convex 
functions  (DC)  programming  [39].  A  full  description  of  the  algorithm  can  be  found  in  the

In this section  we conduct experiments to compare the performance of the proposed SCLDA with 
sparse LDA (SLDA) [42] and multitask feature selection [31]. Specifically  as we focus on LDA  
we use the multitask feature selection method developed in [31] on LDA  denoted as MSLDA. 
Both SLDA and MSLDA adopt convex regularizations. Specifically  SLDA selects features from 
one single data source with L1-regularization; MSLDA selects features from multiple data sources 
with L2/L1 regularization. 
We evaluate the performances of these three methods across various parameters settings  including

𝑛  and the degree of overlapping of the features across different data sources  s% (the larger the 
𝑠%  the more shared features among the datasets). Definition of 𝑠% can be found in the simulation 
settings  𝑀 datasets can be generated following the simulation procedure. We apply the proposed 
SCLDA  to  the 𝑀  datasets   and  identify  one  feature  vector 𝛉(!)  for  each  dataset   with 𝜆  and 𝑞 
elements in the learned feature vector 𝛉(!)which are also non-zero in the 𝛃!; false positives are the 
non-zero elements in 𝛉(!)  which are actually zero in 𝛃!. As there are 𝑚 pairs of the TPs and FPs 
for the 𝑀 datasets  the average TP over the M datasets and the average FP over the M datasets are 
and FPs generation) can be repeated for 𝐵 times  and 𝐵 pairs of average TP and average FP are 
collected for SCLDA. In a similar way  we can obtain 𝐵 pairs of average TP and average FP for 
variables  (𝑝=100 200 500)   the  number  of  data  sources  (𝑚=2 5 10)   and  the  degree  of 
overlapping of the features across different data sources (𝑠%=90% 70%). Additionally  𝑛 𝑝 is 
kept constant  𝑛 𝑝=1. A general observation is that SCLDA is better than SLDA and MSLDA 
𝑚=2 5 10 respectively. It is clear that the advantage of SCLDA over both SLDA and MSLDA is 

both SLDA and MSLDA. 
Figures 1 (a) and (b) show comparison between SCLDA  SLDA and MSLDA by scattering the 
average  TP  against  the  average  FP  for  each  method.  Each  point  corresponds  to  one  of  the  N 
repetitions.  The  comparison  is  across  various  parameters  settings   including  the  number  of 

across  all  the  parameter  settings.  Some  specific  trends  can  be  summarized  as  follows:  (i)  Both 
SCLDA and MSLDA outperform SLDA in terms of TPs; SCLDA further outperforms MSLDA in 
terms  of  FPs.  (ii)  In  Figure  2  (a)   rows  correspond  to  different  numbers  of  data  sources   i.e.  

chosen by the method described in section 3.3. The result can be described by the number of true 
positives (TPs) as well as the number of false positives (FPs). Here  true positives are the non-zero 

used as the performance measures. This procedure (i.e.  from data simulation  to SCLDA  to TPs 

more  significant  when  there  are  more  data  sources.  Also   MSLDA  performs  consistently  better 
than SLDA. Similar phenomena are shown in Figure 2 (b). This demonstrates that in analyzing 
each data source  both SCLDA and MSLDA are able to make use of the information contained in 
other data sources. SCLDA can use this information more efficiently  as SCLDA can produce less 
shrunken parameter estimates than MSLDA and thus it is able to preserve weak-effect features. 
(iii) Comparing Figures 2 (a) and (b)  it can be seen that the advantage of SCLDA or MSLDA 
over  SLDA  is  more  significant  as  the  data  sources  have  more  degree  of  overlapping  in  their

5.1 
Our study includes 49 AD patient and 67 age-matched normal controls (NC)  with each subject of 
AD or NC being scanned both by PET and MRI. The PET and MRI images can be downloaded 
from  the  database  by  the  Alzheimer’s  Disease  Neuroimaging  Initiative.  In  what  follows   we 
outline the data preprocessing steps.  
Each image is spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template  using 
the affine transformation and subsequent non-linear wraping algorithm [43] implemented in the 
SPM MATLAB toolbox. This is to ensure that each voxel is located in the same anatomical region 
for all subjects  so that spatial locations can be reported and interpreted in a consistent manner. 
Once all the images in the MNI template  we further apply the Automated Anatomical Labeling 
(AAL) technique [43] to segment the whole brain of each subject into 116 brain regions. The 90 
regions that belong to the cerebral cortex are selected for the later analysis  as the other regions are 
not included in the cerebral cortex are rarely considered related with AD in the literature.   The 
measurement  of  each  region  in  the  PET  data  is  regional  cerebral  blood  flow  (rCBF);  the 
measurement of each region in the MRI data is the structural volume of the region.

SCLDA  is  applied  to  the  preprocessed  PET  and  MRI  data  of  AD  and  NC  with  the  penalty 
parameter selected by the AIC method mentioned in section 3. 26 disease-related brain regions are 
identified from PET and 21 from MRI (see Table 1 for their names). The maps of the disease-
related  brain  regions  identified  from  PET  and  MRI  are  highlighted  in  Figure  2  (a)  and  (b)  
respectively  with different colors given to neighboring regions in order to distinguish them. Each 
figure  is  a  set  of  horizontal  cut  away  slices  of  the  brain  as  seen  from  the  top   which  aims  to 
provide a full view of locations of the regions.  
One  major  observation  is  that  the  identified  disease-related  brain  regions  from  MRI  are  in  the 
hippocampus  parahippocampus  temporal lobe  frontal lobe  and precuneus  which is consistent 
with  the  existing  literature  that  reports  structural  atrophy  in  these  brain  areas.  [3-6 12-14].  The 
identified disease-related brain regions from PET are in the temporal  frontal and parietal lobes  
which  is  consistent  with  many  functional  neuroimaging  studies  that  report  reduced  rCBF  or 

D isease-related brain regions

reduced  cortical  glucose  metabolism  in  these  areas  [8-10   12-14].  Many  of  these  identified 
disease-related regions can be explained in terms of the AD pathology. For example  hippocampus 
is a region affected by AD the earliest and severely [6] Also  as regions in the temporal lobe are 
essential for memory  damage on these regions by AD can explain the memory loss which is a 
major  clinic  symptom  of  AD.  The  consistency  of  our  findings  with  the  AD  literature  supports 
effectiveness of the proposed SCLDA.  
Another finding is that there is a large overlap between the identified disease-related regions from 
PET  and  those  from  MRI   which  implies  strong  interaction  between  functional  and  structural 
alterations  in  these  regions.  Although  well-accepted  biological  mechanisms  underlying  this 
interaction are still not very clear  there are several explanations existing in the literature. The first 
explanation is that both functional and structural alterations could be the consequence of dendritic 
arborizations  which results from intracellular accumulation of PHFtau and further leads to neuron 
death and grey matter loss [14]. The second explanation is that the AD pathology may include a 
vascular  component   which  may  result  in  reduced  rCBF  due  to  limited  blood  supply  and  may 
ultimately result in structural alteration such as brain atrophy [45].

As  one  of  our  primary  goals  is  to  distinguish  AD  from  NC   the  identified  disease-related  brain 
regions through SCLDA are further utilized for establishing a classification model.  Specifically  
for each subject  the rCBF values of the 26 disease-related brain regions identified from PET and 
the structural volumes of the 21 disease-related brain regions identified from MRI are used  as a 
joint spatial pattern of both brain physiology and structure. As a result  each subject is associated 
with a vector with 47 features/variables. Linear SVM (Support Vector Machine) is employed as 
the  classifier.  The  classification  accuracy  based  on  10-fold  cross-validation  is  94.3%.  For 
comparison  purposes   MSLDA  is  also  applied   which  identifies  45  and  38  disease-related  brain 
regions  for  PET  and  MRI   respectively.  Linear  SVM  applied  to  the  45+38  features  gives  a 
classification  accuracy  of  only  85.8%.  Note  that  MSLDA  identifies  a  much  larger  number  of 
disease-related  brain  regions  than  SCLDA   but  some  of  the  identified  regions  by  MSLDA  may 
indeed be disease-irrelevant  so including them deteriorates the classification.

severity of cognitive im pairm ent in A D  
In  addition  to  classification   it  is  also  of  interest  to  further  verify  relevance  of  the  identified 
disease-related regions with AD in an alternative way. One approach is to investigate the degree to 
which those disease-related regions are relevant to cognitive impairment that can be measured by 
the  Alzheimer’s  disease  assessment  scale  –  cognitive  subscale  (ADAS-cog).  ADAS  measures 
severity  of  the  most  important  symptoms  of  AD   while  its  subscale   ADAS-cog   is  the  most 

R elationship betw een structural atrophy and abnorm al rC BF  and

popular  cognitive  testing  instrument  used  in  clinic  trails.  The  ADAS-cog  consists  of  11  items 
measuring disturbances of memory  language  praxis  attention and other cognitive abilities that 
are often affected by AD. As the total score of these 11 items provides an overall assessment of 
cognitive impairment  we regress this ADAS-cog total score (the response) against the rCBF or 
structure  volume  measurement  (the  predictor)  of  each  identified  brain  region   using  a  simple 
regression. The regression results are listed in Table 1. 
It  is  not  surprising  to  find  that  some  regions  in  the  hippocampus  area  and  temporal  lobes  are 
among the best predictors  as these regions are extensively reported in the literature as the most 
severely affected by AD [3-6]. Also  it is found that most of these brain regions are weak-effect 
predictors  as most of them can only explain a small portion of the variability in the ADAS-cog 
total score  i.e.  many R-square values in Table 1 are less than 10%. However  although the effects 
are weak  most of them are significant  i.e.  most of the p-values in Table 1 are smaller than 0.05. 
Furthermore  it is worth noting that 70.22% variability in ADAS-cog can be explained by taking 
all the 26 brain regions identified from PET as predictors in a multiple regression model; 49.72% 
variability can be explained by taking all the 21 brain regions from MRI as predictors in a multiple 
regression model. All this findings imply that the disease-related brain regions are indeed weak-
effect features if considered individually  but jointly they can play a strong role for characterizing 
AD. This verifies the suitability of the proposed SCLDA for AD studies  as SCLDA can preserve 
weak-effect features.

In the paper  we proposed a SCLDA model for identification of disease-related brain regions of 
AD  from  multi-modality  data   which  is  capable  to  preserve  weak-effect  disease-related  brain 
regions due to its less shrinkage imposed on its parameters. We applied SCLDA to the PET and 
MRI  data  of  early  AD  patients  and  normal  controls.  As  MRI  and  PET  measure  two 
complementary aspects (structural and functional aspects  respectively) of the same AD pathology  
fusion of these two image modalities can make effective use of their interaction and thus improve 
the statistical power in identification of disease-related brain regions. Our findings were consistent 
with  the  literature  and  also  showed  some  new  aspects  that  may  suggest  further  investigation  in 
neuroimaging research in the future.
