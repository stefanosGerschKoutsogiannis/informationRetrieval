Abstract

Neuronal connection weights exhibit short-term depression (STD). The present
study investigates the impact of STD on the dynamics of a continuous attractor
neural network (CANN) and its potential roles in neural information processing.
We ﬁnd that the network with STD can generate both static and traveling bumps 
and STD enhances the performance of the network in tracking external inputs.
In particular  we ﬁnd that STD endows the network with slow-decaying plateau
behaviors  namely  the network being initially stimulated to an active state will
decay to silence very slowly in the time scale of STD rather than that of neural
signaling. We argue that this provides a mechanism for neural systems to hold
short-term memory easily and shut off persistent activities naturally.

1 Introduction

Networks of various types  formed by a large number of neurons through synapses  are the substrate
of brain functions. The network structure is the key that determines the responsive behaviors of a
network to external inputs  and hence the computations implemented by the neural system. Under-
standing the relationship between the structure of a neural network and the function it can achieve
is at the core of using mathematical models for elucidating brain functions.

In the conventional modeling of neuronal networks  it is often assumed that the connection weights
between neurons  which model the efﬁcacy of the activities of pre-synaptic neurons on modulating
the states of post-synaptic neurons  are constants  or vary only in long-time scales when learning
occurs. However  experimental data has consistently revealed that neuronal connection weights
change in short time scales  varying from hundreds to thousands of milliseconds (see  e.g.  [1]). This
is called short-term plasticity (STP). A predominant type of STP is short-term depression (STD) 
which decreases the connection efﬁcacy when a pre-synaptic neuron ﬁres. The physiological process
underlying STD is the depletion of available resources when signals are transmitted from a pre-
synaptic neuron to the post-synaptic one.

Is STD simply a by-product of the biophysical process of neural signaling? Experimental and theo-
retical studies have suggested that this is unlikely to be the case. Instead  STD can play very active
roles in neural computation. For instance  it was found that STD can achieve gain control in reg-
ulating neural responses to external inputs  realizing Weber’s law [2  3]. Another example is that
STD enables a network to generate transient synchronized population ﬁring  appealing for detecting
subtle changes in the environment [4  5]. The STD of a neuron is also thought to play a role in
estimating the information of the pre-synaptic membrane potential from the spikes it receives [6].
From the computational point of view  the time scale of STD resides between fast neural signaling

1

(in the order of milliseconds) and slow learning (in the order of minutes or above)  which is the time
order of many important temporal operations occurring in our daily life  such as working memory.
Thus  STD may serve as a substrate for neural systems to manipulate temporal information in the
relevant time scales.

In this study  we will further explore the potential role of STD in neural information processing 
an issue of fundamental importance but has not been adequately investigated so far. We will use
continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs) as working models. CANNs are a type of recurrent
networks which hold a continuous family of localized active states [7]. Neutral stability is a key
advantage of CANNs  which enables neural systems to update memory states or to track time-
varying stimuli smoothly. CANNs have been successfully applied to describe the retaining of short-
term memory  and the encoding of continuous features  such as the orientation  the head direction
and the spatial location of objects  in neural systems [8  9  10]. CANNs are also shown to provide a
framework for implementing population decoding efﬁciently [11].

We analyze the dynamics of a CANN with STD included  and ﬁnd that apart from the static bump
states  the network can also hold moving bump solutions. This ﬁnding agrees with the results re-
ported in the literature [12  13]. In particular  we ﬁnd that with STD  the network can have slow-
decaying plateau states  that is  the network being stimulated to an active state by a transient input
will decay to silence very slowly in the time order of STD rather than that of neural signaling. This is
a very interesting property. It implies that STD can provide a mechanism for neural systems to gen-
erate short-term memory and shut off activities naturally. We also ﬁnd that STD retains the neutral
stability of the CANN  and enhances the tracking performance of the network to external inputs.

2 The Model

Let us consider a one-dimensional continuous stimulus x encoded by an ensemble of neurons. For
example  the stimulus may represent the moving direction  the orientation or a general continuous
feature of objects extracted by the neural system.

Let u(x  t) be the synaptic input at time t to the neurons whose preferred stimulus is x. The range of
the possible values of the stimulus is −L/2 < x ≤ L/2 and u(x  t) is periodic  i.e.  u(x+L) = u(x).
The dynamics is particularly convenient to analyze in the limit that the interaction range a is much
less than the stimulus range L  so that we can effectively take x ∈ (−∞ ∞). The dynamics of
u(x  t) is determined by the external input Iext(x  t)  the network input from other neurons  and its
own relaxation. It is given by

τs

∂u(x  t)

∂t

= Iext(x  t) + ρZ ∞

−∞

dx′J(x  x′)p(x′  t)r(x′  t) − u(x  t) 

(1)

where τs is the synaptical transmission delay  which is typically in the order of 2 to 5 ms. J(x  x′)
is the base neural interaction from x′ to x. r(x  t) is the ﬁring rate of neurons. It increases with the
synaptic input  but saturates in the presence of a global activity-dependent inhibition. A solvable

ρ is the neural density  and k is a positive constant controlling the strength of global inhibition. The
global inhibition can be generated by shunting inhibition [14].

model that captures these features is given by r(x  t) = u(x  t)2/[1 + kρR ∞

The key character of CANNs is the translational invariance of their neural interactions.
In our
solvable model  we choose Gaussian interactions with a range a  namely  J(x  x′) = J0 exp[−(x −
x′)2/2a2]/(a√2π)  where J0 is a constant.
The STD coefﬁcient p(x  t) in Eq. (1) takes into account the pre-synaptic STD. It has the maximum
value of 1  and decreases with the ﬁring rate of the neuron [15  16]. Its dynamics is given by

(2)
where τd is the time constant for synaptic depression  and the parameter β controls the depression
effect due to neural ﬁring.

τd

The network dynamics is governed by two time scales. The time constants of STD is typically in
the range of hundreds to thousands of milliseconds  much larger than that of neural signaling  i.e. 
τd ≫ τs. The interplay between the fast and slow dynamics causes the network to exhibit interesting
dynamical behaviors.

2.1 Dynamics of CANN without Dynamical Synapses

It is instructive to ﬁrst consider the network dynamics when no dynamical synapses are included.
This is done by setting β = 0 in Eq. (2)  so that p(x  t) = 1 for all t. In this case  the network can
support a continuous family of stationary states when the global inhibition is not too strong.

Speciﬁcally  the steady state solution to Eq. (1) is

˜u(x|z) = u0 exp(cid:20)−

(x − z)2

4a2

(cid:21)  

˜r(x|z) = r0 exp(cid:20)−

(x − z)2

2a2

(cid:21)  

(3)

where u0 = [1 + (1 − k/kc)1/2]J0/(4ak√π)  r0 = [1 + (1 − k/kc)1/2]/(2akρ√2π) and kc =
0 /(8a√2π). These stationary states are translationally invariant among themselves and have the
ρJ 2
Gaussian shape with a free parameter z representing the position of the Gaussian bumps. They exist
for 0 < k < kc  kc is thus the critical inhibition strength.
Fung et al [17] considered the perturbations of the Gaussian states. They found various distortion
modes  each characterized by an eigenvalue representing its rate of evolution in time. A key property
they found is that the translational mode has a zero eigenvalue  and all other distortion modes have
negative eigenvalues for k < kc. This implies that the Gaussian bumps are able to track changes
in the position of the external stimuli by continuously shifting the position of the bumps  with other
distortion modes affecting the tracking process only in the transients.

An example of the tracking process is shown in Figs. 1 and 2  when an external stimulus with a
Gaussian proﬁle is initially centered at z = 0  pinning the center of a Gaussian neuronal response
at the same position. At time t = 0  the stimulus shifts its center from z = 0 to z = 1.5 abruptly.
The bump moves towards the new stimulus position  and catches up with the stimulus change after
a time duration. which is referred to as the reaction time.

3 Dynamics of CANN with Synaptic Depression

For clarity  we will ﬁrst summarize the main results obtained on the network dynamics due to STD 
and then present the theoretical analysis in Sec. 4.

3.1 The Phase Diagram

In the presence of STD  CANNs exhibit new interesting dynamical behaviors. Apart from the static
bump state  the network also supports moving bump states. To construct a phase diagram mapping
these behaviors  we ﬁrst consider how the global inhibition k and the synaptic depression β scale
with other parameters. In the steady state solution of Eq. (1)  u0 and ρJ0u2
0 should have the same
dimension; so are 1−p(x  t) and τdβu0 in Eq. (2). Hence we introduce the dimensionless parameters
0 ). The phase diagram obtained by numerical solutions to the network
k ≡ k/kc and β ≡ τdβ/(ρ2J 2
dynamics is shown in Fig. 3.

τd/τs = 50  a = 0.5/6  range of the
network = [−π  π).

We ﬁrst note that the synaptic depression and the global inhibition plays the same role in reducing
the amplitude of the bump states. This can be seen from the steady state solution of u(x  t)  which
reads

(4)

u(x) =Z dx′

ρJ(x − x′)u(x′)2

1 + kρR dx′′u(x′′)2 + τdβu(x′)2 .

The third term in the denominator of the integrand arises from STD  and plays the role of a local
inhibition that is strongest where the neurons are most active. Hence we see that the silent state with
u(x  t) = 0 is the only stable state when either k or β is large.
When STD is weak  the network behaves similarly with CANNs without STD  that is  the static
bump state is present up to k near 1. However  when β increases  a state with the bump sponta-
neously moving at a constant velocity comes into existence. Such moving states have been pre-
dicted in CANNs [12  13]  and can be associated with traveling wave behaviors widely observed in
the neocortex [18]. At an intermediate range of β  both the static and moving states coexist  and
the ﬁnal state of the network depends on the initial condition. When β increases further  only the
moving state is present.

3.2 The Plateau Behavior

The network dynamics displays a very interesting behavior in the parameter regime when the static
bump solution just loses its stability. In this regime  an initially activated network state decays very
slowly to silence  in the time order of τd. Hence  although the bump state eventually decays to the
silent state  it goes through a plateau region of a slowly decaying amplitude  as shown in Fig. 4.

3.3 Enhanced Tracking Performance

The responses of CANNs with STD to an abrupt change of stimulus are illustrated in Fig. 5. Com-
pared with networks without STD  we ﬁnd that the bump shifts to the new position faster. The extent
of improvement in the presence of STD is quantiﬁed in Fig. 6. However  when β is too strong  the
bump tends to overshoot the target before eventually approaching it.

Despite the apparently complex behaviors of CANNs with STD  we will show in this section that a
Gaussian approximation can reproduce the behaviors and facilitate the interpretation of the results.
Details are explained in Supplementary Information. We observe that the proﬁle of the bump re-
mains effectively Gaussian in the presence of synaptic depression. On the other hand  there is a
considerable distortion of the proﬁle of the synaptic depression  when STD is strong. Yet  to the
lowest order approximation  let us approximate the proﬁle of the synaptic depression to be a Gaus-
sian as well  which is valid when STD is weak  as shown in Fig. 7(a). Hence  for a ≪ L  we propose
the following ansatz

u(x  t) = u0(t) exp(cid:20)−

When these expressions are substituted into the dynamical equations (1) and (2)  other functions

approximated by their projections onto the Gaussian functions. In Eq. (1)  we approximate

when p0 is the steady state solution of Eqs. (1) and (2). The boundary of this region is shown as a
dashed line in Fig. 3. Unfortunately  this line is not easily observed in numerical solutions since the
static bump is unstable against ﬂuctuations that are asymmetric with respect to its central position.
Although the bump is stable against symmetric ﬂuctuations  asymmetric ﬂuctuations can displace
its position and eventually convert it to a moving bump.

4.2 The Solution of the Moving Bumps

As shown in Fig. 7(b)  the proﬁle of a moving bump is characterized by a lag of the synaptic
depression behind the moving bump. This is because neurons tend to be less active in locations of
low values of p(x  t)  causing the bump to move away from locations of strong synaptic depression.
In turn  the region of synaptic depression tends to follow the bump. However  if the time scale
of synaptic depression is large  the recovery of the synaptic depressed region is slowed down  and
cannot catch up with the bump motion. Thus  the bump starts moving spontaneously.

To incorporate asymmetry into the moving state  we propose the following ansatz:

u(x  t) = u0(t) exp(cid:20)−
p(x  t) = 1 − p0(t) exp(cid:20)−

where A = 7√7/4  B = (7/4)[(5/2)p7/6− 1]  and C = (343/36)(1−p6/7). As shown in Fig.

3  the boundary of this region effectively coincides with the numerical solution of the line separating
the static and moving phases.
Note that when τd/τs increases  the static phase shrinks. This is because the recovery of the synaptic
depressed region is slowed down  making it harder to catch up with changes in the bump motion.

and (b) the moving state at (k  β) =
(0.5  0.015). Parameter: τd/τs = 50.

An alternative approach that arrives at Eq. (13) is to consider the instability of the static bump 
which is obtained by setting v and p1 to zero in Eqs. (11) and (12). Considering the instability of
the static bump against the asymmetric ﬂuctuations in p1 and vt  we again arrive at Eq. (13). This
shows that as soon as the moving bump comes into existence  the static bump becomes unstable.
This also implies that in the entire region that the static and moving bumps coexist  the static bump
is unstable to asymmetric ﬂuctuations. It is stable (or more precisely  metastable) when it is static 
but once it is pushed to one side  it will continue to move along that direction. We may call this
behavior metastatic. As we shall see  this metastatic behavior is also the cause of the enhanced
tracking performance.

4.3 The Plateau Behavior

To illustrate the plateau behavior  we select a point in the marginally unstable regime of the silent
phase  that is  in the vicinity of the static phase. As shown in Fig. 8  the nullclines of u and p0

6

(du/dt = 0 and dp0/dt = 0 respectively) do not have any intersections as they do in the static
phase where the bump state exists. Yet  they are still close enough to create a region with very slow
√k)]. Then  in Fig. 8 
dynamics near the apex of the u-nullcline at (u  p0) = [(8/k)1/2 p7/4(1 −
we plot the trajectories of the dynamics starting from different initial conditions. For veriﬁcation  we
also solve the full equations (1) and (2)  and plot a ﬂow diagram with the axes being maxx u(x  t)
and 1 − minx p(x  t). The resultant ﬂow diagram has a satisfactory agreement with Fig. 8.
The most interesting family of trajectories is represented by B and C in Fig. 8. Due to the much
faster dynamics of u  trajectories starting from a wide range of initial conditions converge rapidly 
in a time of the order τs  to a common trajectory in the close neighborhood of the u-nullcline. Along
this common trajectory  u is effectively the steady state solution of Eq. (8) at the instantaneous value
of p0(t)  which evolves with the much longer time scale of τd. This gives rise to the plateau region
of u which can survive for a duration of the order τd. The plateau ends after the trajectory has passed
the slow region near the apex of the u-nullcline. This dynamics is in clear contrast with trajectory
D  in which the bump height decays to zero in a time of the order τs.
Trajectory A represents another family of trajectories having rather similar behaviors  although the
lifetimes of their plateaus are not so long. These trajectories start from more depleted initial con-
ditions  and hence do not have chances to get close to the u-nullcline. Nevertheless  they converge
rapidly  in a time of order τs  to the band u ≈ (8/k)1/2  where the dynamics of u is slow. The
trajectories then rely mainly on the dynamics of p0 to carry them out of this slow region  and hence
plateaus of lifetimes of the order τd are created.

space of k and β. The lines are the two top-
most phase boundaries in Fig. 3. In the initial
condition  α = 0.5.

Following similar arguments  the plateau behavior also exists in the stable region of the static states.
This happens when the initial condition of the network lies outside the basin of attraction of the
static states  but it is still in the vicinity of the basin boundary.

When one goes deeper into the silent phase  the region of slow dynamics between the u- and p0-
nullclines broadens. Hence plateau lifetimes are longest near the phase boundary between the bump
and silent states  and become shorter when one goes deeper into the silent phase. This is conﬁrmed
by the contours of plateau lifetimes in the phase diagram shown in Fig. 9 obtained by numerical
solution. The initial condition is uniformly set by introducing an external stimulus I ext(x|z0) =
αu0 exp[−x2/(4a2)] to the right hand side of Eq. (1)  where α is the stimulus strength. After the
network has reached a steady state  the stimulus is removed at t = 0  leaving the network to relax.

However  when describing the overshooting of the tracking process  the quantitative agreement be-
tween the numerical solution and the ansatz in Eqs. (11) and (12) is not satisfactory. We have
made improvement by developing a higher order perturbation analysis using basis functions of the
quantum harmonic oscillator [17]. As shown in Fig. 5  the quantitative agreement is much more
satisfactory.

5 Conclusions and Discussions

In this work  we have investigated the impact of STD on the dynamics of a CANN  and found
that the network can support both static and moving bumps. Static bumps exist only when the
synaptic depression is sufﬁciently weak. A consequence of synaptic depression is that it places
static bumps in the metastatic state  so that its response to changing stimuli is speeded up  enhancing
its tracking performance. We conjecture that moving bump states may be associated with traveling
wave behaviors widely observed in the neurocortex.

A ﬁnding in our work with possibly very important biological implications is that STD endows the
network with slow-decaying behaviors. When the network is initially stimulated to an active state
by an external input  it will decay to silence very slowly after the input is removed. The duration
of the plateau is of the time scale of STD rather than neural signaling  and it provides a way for the
network to hold the stimulus information for up to hundreds of milliseconds  if the network operates
in the parameter regime that the bumps are marginally unstable. This property is  on the other hand 
extremely difﬁcult to be implemented in attractor networks without STD. In a CANN without STD 
an active state of the network decays to silence exponentially fast or persists forever  depending on
the initial activity level of the network. Indeed  how to shut off the activity of a CANN has been a
challenging issue that received wide attention in theoretical neuroscience  with solutions suggesting
that a strong external input either in the form of inhibition or excitation must be applied (see  e.g. 
[19]). Here  we show that STD provides a mechanism for closing down network activities naturally
and in the desirable duration.

We have also analyzed the dynamics of CANNs with STD using a Gaussian approximation of the
bump. It describes the phase diagram of the static and moving phases  the plateau behavior  and
provides insights on the metastatic nature of the bumps and its relation with the enhanced tracking
performance. In most cases  approximating 1 − p(x  t) by a Gaussian proﬁle is already sufﬁcient to
produce qualitatively satisfactory results. However  higher order perturbation analysis is required to
yield more accurate descriptions of results such as the overshooting in the tracking process (Fig. 5).

Besides STD  there are other forms of STP that may be relevant to realizing short-term memory.
Mongillo et al. [20] have recently proposed a very interesting idea for achieving working memory
in the prefrontal cortex by utilizing the effect of short-term facilitation (STF). Compared with STD 
STF has the opposite effect in modifying the neuronal connection weights. The underlying bio-
physics of STF is the increased level of residual calcium due to neural ﬁring  which increases the
releasing probability of neural transmitters. Mongillo et al. [20] showed that STF provides a way
for the network to encode the information of external inputs in the facilitated connection weights 
and it has the advantage of not having to recruit persistent neural ﬁring and hence is economically
efﬁcient. This STF-based memory mechanism is  however  not necessarily contradictory to the
STD-based one we propose here. They may be present in different cortical areas for different com-
putational purposes. STD and STF have been observed to have different effects in different cortical
areas. One location is the sensory cortex where CANN models are often applicable. Here  the effects
of STD tends to be stronger than that of STF. Different from the STF-based mechanism  our work
suggests that the STD-based one exhibits the prolonged neural ﬁring  which has been observed in
some cortical areas. In terms of information transmission  prolonged neural ﬁring is preferable in
the early information pathways  so that the stimulus information can be conveyed to higher cortical
areas through neuronal interactions. Hence  it seems that the brain may use a strategy of weight-
ing the effects of STD and STF differentially for carrying out different computational tasks. It is
our goal in future work to explore the joint impact of STD and STF on the dynamics of neuronal
networks.
