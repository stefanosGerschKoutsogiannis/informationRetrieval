2007,Estimating disparity with confidence from energy neurons,Binocular fusion takes place over a limited region smaller than one degree of visual angle (Panum's fusional area)  which is on the order of the range of preferred disparities measured in populations of disparity-tuned neurons in the visual cortex. However  the actual range of binocular disparities encountered in natural scenes ranges over tens of degrees. This discrepancy suggests that there must be a mechanism for detecting whether the stimulus disparity is either inside or outside of the range of the preferred disparities in the population. Here  we present a statistical framework to derive feature in a population of V1 disparity neuron to determine the stimulus disparity within the preferred disparity range of the neural population. When optimized for natural images  it yields a feature that can be explained by the normalization which is a common model in V1 neurons. We further makes use of the feature to estimate the disparity in natural images. Our proposed model generates more correct estimates than coarse-to-fine multiple scales approaches and it can also identify regions with occlusion.

Abstract

The peak location in a population of phase-tuned neurons has been shown to be a
more reliable estimator for disparity than the peak location in a population of
position-tuned neurons. Unfortunately  the disparity range covered by a phase-
tuned population is limited by phase wraparound. Thus  a single population can-
not cover the large range of disparities encountered in natural scenes unless the
scale of the receptive fields is chosen to be very large  which results in very low
resolution depth estimates. Here we describe a biologically plausible measure of
the confidence that the stimulus disparity is inside the range covered by a popula-
tion of phase-tuned neurons. Based upon this confidence measure  we propose an
algorithm for disparity estimation that uses many populations of high-resolution
phase-tuned neurons that are biased to different disparity ranges via position
shifts between the left and right eye receptive fields. The population with the
highest confidence is used to estimate the stimulus disparity. We show that this
algorithm outperforms a previously proposed coarse-to-fine algorithm for dispar-
ity estimation  which uses disparity estimates from coarse scales to select the
populations used at finer scales and can effectively detect occlusions.

1 Introduction 
Binocular disparity  the displacement between the image locations of an object between two eyes or
cameras  is an important depth cue. Mammalian brains appear to represent the stimulus disparity
using populations of disparity-tuned neurons in the visual cortex [1][2]. The binocular energy
model is a first order model that explains the responses of individual disparity-tuned neurons [3]. In
this model  the preferred disparity tuning of the neurons is determined by the phase and position
shifts between the left and right monocular receptive fields (RFs). 
Peak picking is a common disparity estimation strategy for these neurons([4]-[6]). In this strategy 
the disparity estimates are computed by the preferred disparity of the neuron with the largest
response among the neural population. Chen and Qian [4] have suggested that the peak location in
a population of phase-tuned disparity energy neurons is a more reliable estimate than the peak loca-
tion in a population of position-tuned neurons. 
It is difficult to estimate disparity from a single phase-tuned neuron population because its range of
preferred disparities is limited. Figure 1 shows the population response of phase-tuned neurons
(vertical cross section) for different stimulus disparities. If the stimulus disparity is confined to the
range of preferred disparities of this population  the peak location changes linearly with the stimu-
lus disparity. Thus  we can estimate the disparity from the peak. However  in natural viewing condi-
tion  the stimulus disparity ranges over ten times larger than the range of the preferred disparities of
the population [7]. The peak location no longer indicates the stimulus disparity  since the peaks still
occur even when the stimulus disparity is outside the range of neurons’ preferred disparities. The
false peaks arise from two sources: the phase wrap-around due to the sinusoidal modulation in the

This was generated by presenting the left image of the “Cones” stereogram shown in Figure 5a to
both eyes but varying the disparity by keeping the left image fixed and shifting the right image. At
each point  the image intensity represents the response of a disparity neuron tuned to a fixed

Gabor function modelling neuron’s receptive field (RF) profile  or unmatching edges entering the
neuron's RF [5].
Although a single population can cover a large disparity range  the large size of the required recep-
tive fields results in very low resolution depth estimates. To address this problem  Chen and Qian
[4] proposed a coarse-to-fine algorithm which refines the estimates computed from coarse scales
using populations tuned to finer scales.
Here we present an alternative way to estimate the stimulus disparity using a biologically plausible
confidence measure that indicates whether the stimulus disparity lies inside or outside the range of
preferred disparities in a population of phase tuned neurons. We motivate this measure by examin-
ing the empirical statistics of the model neuron responses on natural images. Finally  we demon-
strate the efficacy of using this measure to estimate the stimulus disparity. Our model generates
better estimates than the coarse-to-fine approach [4]  and can detect occlusions. 

2 Features of the phase-tuned disparity population
In this section  we define different features of a population of phase-tuned neurons. These features
will be used to define the confidence measure. Figure 2a illustrates the binocular disparity energy
model of a phase-tuned neuron [3]. For simplicity  we assume 1D processing  which is equivalent
to considering one orientation in the 2D case. The response of a binocular simple cell is modelled
by summing of the outputs of linear monocular Gabor filters applied to both left and right images 
followed by a positive or negative half squaring nonlinearity. The response of a binocular complex
cell is the sum of the four simple cell responses.

were kept the same as the previous analysis. We also performed spatial pooling and orientation
pooling to improve the estimation. For spatial pooling  we applied a circularly symmetric Gaussian
function with standard deviation 
. For orientation pooling  we pooled the responses over five ori-
entations ranging from 30 to 150 degrees. The range of the position-shifts for the populations was
set to the largest disparity range  
We also implemented the coarse-to-fine model as described in [4] for comparison. In this model  an
initial disparity estimate computed from a population of phase-tuned neurons at the coarsest scale is
successively refined by the populations of phase-tuned neurons at the finer scales. By choosing the
coarsest scale large enough  the disparity range covered by this method can be arbitrarily large. The
coarsest and the finest scales had the Gabor periods of 512 and 16 pixels. The Gabor periods of the
successive scales differed by a factor of 
. Neurons at the finest scale had the same RF parame-
ters as our model. Same spatial pooling and orientation pooling were applied on each scale. 
Figure 5d-e show the estimated disparity maps and the error maps of the two approaches. The error
maps show the regions where the disparity estimates exceed 1 pixel of error in the disparity. Both
models correctly recover the stimulus disparity at most locations with gradual disparity changes 
but tend to make errors at the depth boundaries. However  the proposed model generates more
accurate estimates. In the coarse-to-fine model  the percentage of pixels being incorrectly estimated
is 36.3%  while our proposed model is only 27.8%.

The coarse-to-fine model tends to make errors around the depth boundaries. This arises because the
assumption that the stimulus disparity is constant over the RF of the neuron is unlikely at very large
scales. At boundaries  the coarse-to-fine model generates poor initial estimates  which cannot be
corrected at the finer scales  because the actual stimulus disparities are outside the range considered
at the finer scales.
On the other hand  the proposed model can not only estimate the stimulus disparity  but also can
validate the estimates. In general  the responses of neurons selective to different position disparities
are not comparable  since they depend upon image contrast which varies at different spatial loca-
tions. However  the feature 
  which is computed by normalizing the response peak by the average
response  eliminates such dependency. Moreover  the invalid regions detected (the black regions on
the disparity maps) are in excellent agreement with the error labels.

R

4.2 Occlusion detection 
In addition to validating the disparity estimates  the feature 
 can also be used to detect occlusion.
Occlusion is one of the challenging problems in stereo vision. Occlusion occurs near the depth dis-
continuities where there is no correspondence between the left and right images. The disparity in
the occlusion regions is undefined. The occlusion regions for these stereograms are shown in
Figure 5c.
There are three possibilities for image pixels that are labelled as out of range (DOUT). They are
occluded pixels  pixels with valid disparities that are incorrectly estimated  and pixels with valid
disparity that are correctly estimated. Figure 6a shows the percentages of DOUT pixels that fall
into each possibility as the threshold

5 Discussion
In this paper  we have proposed an algorithm to estimate stimulus disparities based on a confidence
measure computed from population of hybrid tuned disparity neurons. Although there have been
previously proposed models that estimate the stimulus disparity from populations of hybrid tuned
neurons [4][10]  our model is the first that also provides a confidence measure for these estimates.
Our analysis suggests that pixels with low confidence are likely to be in occluded regions. The
detection of occlusion  an important problem in stereo vision  was not addressed in these previous
approaches.
The confidence measure used in the proposed algorithm can be computed using normalization 
which has been used to model the responses of V1 neurons [11]. Previous work has emphasized the
role of normalization in reducing the effect of image contrast or in ensuring that the neural
responses tuned to different stimulus dimensions are comparable [12]. Our results show that  in
addition to these roles  normalization also serves to make the magnitude of the neural responses
more representative of the confidence in validating the hypothesis that the input disparity is close to
the neurons preferred disparity. The classification performance using this normalized feature is
close to that using the statistical optimal boundaries. 
Aggregating the neural responses over locations  orientations and scales is a common technique to
improve the estimation performance. For the consistency with the coarse-to-fine approach  our
algorithm also applies spatial and orientation pooling before computing the confidence. An inter-
esting question  which we are now investigating  is whether individual confidence measures com-
puted from different locations or orientations can be combined systematically.
