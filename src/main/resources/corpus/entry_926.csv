Abstract

Performing interventions is a major challenge in economic policy-making. We
propose causal strategic inference as a framework for conducting interventions
and apply it to large  networked microﬁnance economies. The basic solution
platform consists of modeling a microﬁnance market as a networked economy 
learning the parameters of the model from the real-world microﬁnance data  and
designing algorithms for various causal questions. For a special case of our model 
we show that an equilibrium point always exists and that the equilibrium interest
rates are unique. For the general case  we give a constructive proof of the exis-
tence of an equilibrium point. Our empirical study is based on the microﬁnance
data from Bangladesh and Bolivia  which we use to ﬁrst learn our models. We
show that causal strategic inference can assist policy-makers by evaluating the
outcomes of various types of interventions  such as removing a loss-making bank
from the market  imposing an interest rate cap  and subsidizing banks.

Introduction

Although the history of microﬁnance systems takes us back to as early as the 18th century  the
foundation of the modern microﬁnance movement was laid in the 1970s by Muhammad Yunus 
a then-young Economics professor in Bangladesh.
It was a time when the newborn nation was
struggling to recover from a devastating war and an ensuing famine. A blessing in disguise may it be
called  it led Yunus to design a small-scale experimentation on micro-lending as a tool for poverty
alleviation. The feedback from that experimentation gave Yunus and his students the insight that
micro-lending mechanism  with its social and humanitarian goals  could successfully intervene in
the informal credit market that was predominated by opportunistic moneylenders. Although far from
experiencing a smooth ride  the microﬁnance movement has nevertheless been a great success story
ever since  especially considering the fact that it began with just a small  out-of-pocket investment
on 42 clients and boasts a staggering 100 million poor clients worldwide at present [27]. Yunus and
his organization Grameen Bank have recently been honored with the Nobel peace prize “for their
efforts to create economic and social development from below.”
A puzzling element in the success of microﬁnance programs is that while commercial banks dealing
with well-off customers struggle to recover loans  microﬁnance institutions (MFI) operate without
taking any collateral and yet experience very low default rates! The central mechanism that MFIs use
to mitigate risks is known as the group lending with joint-liability contract. Roughly speaking  loans
are given to groups of clients  and if a person fails to repay her loan  then either her partners repay
it on her behalf or the whole group gets excluded from the program. Besides risk-mitigation  this
mechanism also helps lower MFI’s cost of monitoring clients’ projects. Group lending with a joint-
liability contract also improves repayment rates and mitigates moral hazard [13]. Group lending
and many other interesting aspects of microﬁnance systems  such as efﬁciency and distribution of

1

intervening informal credit markets  failure of pro-poor commercial banks  gender issues  subsidies 
etc.  have been beautifully delineated by de Aghion and Morduch in their book [9].
Here  we assume that assortative matching and joint-liability contracts would mitigate the risks of
adverse selection [13] and moral hazard. We further assume that due to these mechanisms  there
would be no default on loans. This assumption of complete repayment of loans may seem to be
very much idealistic. However  practical evidence suggests very high repayment rates. For example 
Grameen Bank’s loan recovery rate is 99.46% [21].
Next  we present causal strategic inference  followed by our model of microﬁnance markets and our
algorithms for computing equilibria and learning model parameters. We present an empirical study
at the end. We leave much of the details to the Appendix  located in the supplementary material.

2 Causality in Strategic Settings

Going back two decades  one of the most celebrated success stories in the study of causality  which
studies cause and effect questions using mathematical models of real-world phenomena  was the
development of causal probabilistic inference. It was led by Judea Pearl  who was later awarded the
ACM Turing prize in 2011 for his seminal contribution. In his highly acclaimed book on causal-
ity  Pearl organizes causal queries in probabilistic settings in three different levels of difﬁculty—
prediction  interventions  and counterfactuals (in the order of increasing difﬁculty) [22  p. 38]. For
example  an intervention query is about the effects of changing an existing system by what Judea
Pearl calls “surgery.” We focus on this type of query here.
Causal Strategic Inference. We study causal inferences in game-theoretic settings for intervention-
type queries. Since game theory reliably encodes strategic interactions among a set of players 
we call this type of inference causal strategic inference. Note that interventions in game-theoretic
settings are not new (see Appendix B for a survey). Therefore  we use causal strategic inference
simply as a convenient name here. Our main contribution is a framework for performing causal
strategic inference in networked microﬁnance economy.
As mentioned above  interventions are carried out by surgeries. So  what could be a surgery in a
game-theoretic setting? Analogous to the probabilistic settings [22  p. 23]  the types of surgeries we
consider here change the “structure” of the game. This can potentially mean changing the payoff
function of a player  removing a player from the game  adding a new player to the game  changing
the set of actions of a player  as well as any combination of these. We discuss other possibilities in
Appendix A. See also [14].
The proposed framework of causal strategic inference is composed of the following components:
mathematically modeling a complex system  learning the parameters of the model from real-world
data  and designing algorithms to predict the effects of interventions.
Review of Literature. There is a growing literature in econometrics on modeling strategic scenarios
and estimating the parameters of the model. Examples are Bjorn and Vuong’s model of labor force
participation [5]  Bresnahan and Reiss’ entry models [6  7]  Berry’s model of airline markets [4] 
Seim’s model of product differentiation [24]  Augereau et al.’s model of technology adoption [2].
A survey of the recent results is given by Bajari et al. [3]. All of the above models are based on
McFadden’s random utility model [18]  which often leads to an analytical solution. In contrast  our
model is based on classical models of two-sided economies  for which there is no known analytical
solution. Therefore  our solution approach is algorithmic  not analytic.
More importantly  although all of the above studies model a strategic scenario and estimate the
parameters of the respective model  none of them perform any intervention  which is one of our main
goals. We present more details on each of these as well as several additional studies in Appendix B.
Our model is closely related to the classical Fisher model [12]. An important distinction between
our model and Fisher’s  including its graphical extension [16]  is that our model allows buyers (i.e. 
villages) to invest the goods (i.e.  loans) in productive projects  thereby generating revenue that can
be used to pay for the goods (i.e.  repay the loans). In other words  the crucial modeling parameter of
“endowment” is no longer a constant in our case. For the same reason  the classical Arrow-Debreu
model [1] or the recently developed graphical extension to the Arrow-Debreu model [15]  does not
capture our setting. Moreover  in our model  the buyers have a very different objective function.

3 Our Model of Microﬁnance Markets

We model a microﬁnance market as a two-sided market consisting of MFIs and villages. Each MFI
has branches in a subset of the villages  and each branch of an MFI deals with the borrowers in that
village only. Similarly  each village can only interact with the MFIs present there.
We use the following notation. There are n MFIs and m villages. Vi is the set of villages where MFI
i operates and Bj is the set of MFIs that operate in village j. Ti is the ﬁnite total amount of loan
available to MFI i to be disbursed. gj(l) := dj + ejl is the revenue generation function of village
j (parameterized by the loan amount l)  where the initial endowment dj > 0 (i.e.  each village has
other sources of income [9  Ch. 1.3]) and the rate of revenue generation ej ≥ 1 are constants. ri
is the ﬂat interest rate of MFI i and xj i is the amount of loan borrowed by village j from MFI i.
Finally  the villages have a diversiﬁcation parameter λ ≥ 0 that quantiﬁes how much they want their
loan portfolios to be diversiﬁed. 1 The problem statement is given below.
Following are the inputs to the problem. First  for each MFI i  1 ≤ i ≤ n  we are given the total
amount of money Ti that the MFI has and the set Vi of villages that the MFI has branches. Second 
for each village j  1 ≤ j ≤ m  we are given the parameters dj > 0 and ej > 1 of the village’s
revenue generation function 2 and the set Bj of the MFIs that operate in that village.
MFI-side optimization problem. Each MFI i wants to set its interest rate ri such that all of its loan
is disbursed. This is known as market-clearance in economics. Here  the objective function is a
constant due to the MFIs’ goal of market-clearance.

Village-side optimization problem. Each village j wants to maximize its diversiﬁed loan portfolio

term  where λ is chosen using the data. 3 We call the ﬁrst constraint of (PV ) the budget constraint.

For this two-sided market  we use an equilibrium point as the solution concept. It is deﬁned by an

that the following two conditions hold. First  given the allocations x∗  each MFI i is optimizing the
program (PM ). Second  given the interest rates r∗  each village j is optimizing the program (PV ).
Justiﬁcation of Modeling Aspects. Our model is inspired by the book of de Aghion and Mor-
duch [9] and several other studies [20  26  23]. We list some of our modeling aspects below.

j = (x∗

1For simplicity  we assume that all the villages have the same diversiﬁcation parameters.
2When we apply our model to real-world settings  we will see that in contrast to the other inputs  dj and ej
are not explicitly mentioned in the data and therefore  need to be learned from the data. The machine learning
scheme for that will be presented in Section 4.2.

cause xj i’s here can be larger than 1.

Objective of MFIs. It may seem unusual that although MFIs are banks  we do not model them as
proﬁt-maximizing agents. The perception that MFIs make proﬁts while serving the poor has been
described as a “myth” [9  Ch. 1]. In fact  the book devotes a whole chapter to bust this myth [9  Ch.
9]. Therefore  empirical evidence supports modeling MFIs as not-for-proﬁt organizations.
Objective of Villages. Typical customers of MFIs are low-income people engaged in small projects
and most of them are women working at home (e.g.  Grameen Bank has a 95% female customer
base) [9]. Clearly  there is a distinction between customers borrowing from an MFI and those bor-
rowing from commercial banks. Therefore  we model the village side as non-corporate agents.
Diversiﬁcation of Loan Portfolios. Empirical studies suggest that the village side does not maximize
its loan by borrowing only from the lowest interest rate MFI [26  23]. There are other factors  such
as large loan sizes  shorter waiting periods  and ﬂexible repayment schemes [26]. We added the
diversiﬁcation term in the village objective function to reﬂect this. Furthermore  this formulation is
in line with the quantal response approach [19] and human subjects are known to respond to it[17].
Complete repayment of loans. A hallmark of microﬁnance systems worldwide is very high repay-
ment rates. For example  the loan recovery rate of Grameen Bank is 99.46% and PKSF 99.51% [21].
Due to such empirical evidence  we assume that the village-side completely repays its loan.

that offer the lowest interest rate. That is  (cid:80)

It will be useful to ﬁrst study the case of non-diversiﬁed loan portfolios  i.e.  λ = 0. In this case  the
villages simply wish to maximize the amount of loan that they can borrow. Several properties of an
equilibrium point can be derived for this special case. We give the complete proofs in Appendix C.

that x∗

that x∗

3.2 Eisenberg-Gale Formulation

We now present an Eisenberg-Gale convex program formulation of a restricted case of our model
where the diversiﬁcation parameter λ = 0 and all the villages j  1 ≤ j ≤ m  have the same revenue
generation function gj(l) := d + el  where d > 0 and e ≥ 1 are constants. We ﬁrst prove that
this case is equivalent to the following Eisenberg-Gale convex program [11  25]  which gives us the
existence of an equilibrium point and the uniqueness of the equilibrium interest rates as a corollary.
Below is the Eisenberg-Gale convex program [11  p. 166].

Theorem 3.5. The special case of microﬁnance markets with identical villages and no loan portfolio
diversiﬁcation  has an equivalent Eisenberg-Gale formulation.

1 ≤ i ≤ n  j ∈ Vi

Proof Sketch. The complete proof is very long and given in Appendix C. We ﬁrst make a connection
between an equilibrium point (x∗  r∗) of a microﬁnance market and the variables of program (PE).
In particular  we deﬁne x∗
i in terms of certain dual variables of (PE). Using
the properties given in Section 3.1  we show that the equilibrium conditions of (PM ) and (PV ) in
this special case are equivalent to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of (PE).
Corollary 3.6. For the above special case  there exists an equilibrium point with unique interest
rates [11] and a combinatorial polynomial-time algorithm to compute it [25].

An implication of Theorem 3.5 is that in a more restricted case of our model (with the additional
constraint of Ti being same for all MFI i)  our model is indeed a graphical linear Fisher model where
all the “utility coefﬁcients” are set to 1 (see the convex program 5.1 [25] to verify this).

4 Computational Scheme

For the clarity of presentation we ﬁrst design an algorithm for equilibrium computation and then
talk about learning the parameters of our model.

4.1 Computing an Equilibrium Point

We give a constructive proof of the existence of an equilibrium point in the microﬁnance market
deﬁned by (PM ) and (PV ). The inputs are λ > 0  ej and dj for each village j  and Ti for each MFI
i. We ﬁrst give a brief outline of our scheme in Algorithm 1.

Change ri as described after Lemma 4.3.
For each village j ∈ Vi  update its best response xj reﬂecting the change in ri.

Before going on to the details of how to change ri in Line 6 of Algorithm 1  we characterize the best
response of the villages used in Line 7.
Lemma 4.1. (Village’s Best Response) Given the interest rates of all the MFIs  the following is the
unique best response of any village j to any MFI i ∈ Bj:

j change in Line 7  for any village j ∈ Vi. Next  we show the direction of these changes.

The next lemma is a cornerstone of our theoretical results. Here  we use the term turn of an MFI to
refer to the iterative execution of Line 6  wherein an MFI sets its interest rate to clear its market.
Lemma 4.3. (Strategic Complementarity) Suppose that an MFI i has increased its interest rate at
the end of its turn. Thereafter  it cannot be the best response of any other MFI k to lower its interest
rate when its turn comes in the algorithm.

Proof Sketch. The proof follows from Lemma 4.2 and Assumption 3.1. The main task is to show
that when ri increases α∗
In essence  Lemma 4.2 is a result of strategic substitutability [10] between the MFI and the village
sides  while Lemma 4.3 is a result of strategic complementarity [8] among the MFIs. Our algorithm
exploits these two properties as we ﬁll in the details of Lines 6 and 7 next.
Line 6: MFI’s Best Response. By Lemma 4.2  the total demand for MFI i’s loan monotonically
decreases with the increase of ri. We use a binary search between the upper and the lower bounds
of ri given in Property 3.8 to ﬁnd the “right” value of ri. More details are given in Appendix D.
Line 7: Village’s Best Response. We use Lemma 4.1 to compute each village j’s best response x∗
to MFIs i ∈ Bj. However  Equation (1) requires computation of α∗

We exploit the convexity of Equation (2) to design a simple search algorithm to ﬁnd α∗

Theorem 4.4. There always exists an equilibrium point in a microﬁnance market speciﬁed by pro-
grams (PM ) and (PV ).

Proof Sketch. Use Lemmas 4.3 and 4.1 and the well-known monotone convergence theorem.

4.2 Learning the Parameters of the Model

The inputs are the spatial structure of the market  the observed loan allocations ˜xj i for all village j
and all MFI i ∈ Bj  the observed interest rates ˜ri and total supply Ti for all MFI i. The objective of
the learning scheme is to instantiate parameters ej and dj for all j. We learn these parameters using
the program below so that an equilibrium point closely approximates the observed data.

The above is a nested (bi-level) optimization program. The term C is a constant. In the interior
optimization program  x∗ are best responses of the villages  w.r.t. the parameters and the interest
rates r∗. In practice  we exploit Lemma 4.1 to compute x∗ more efﬁciently  since it sufﬁces to search
for Lagrange multipliers αj in a much smaller search space and then apply Equation (1). We use the
interior-point algorithm of Matlab’s large-scale optimization package to solve the above program.
In the next section  we show that the above learning procedure does not overﬁt the real-world data.
We also highlight the issue of equilibrium selection for parameter estimation.

5 Empirical Study

We now present our empirical study based on the microﬁnance data from Bolivia and Bangladesh.
The details of this study can be found in Appendix E (included in the supplementary material).
Case Study: Bolivia
Data. We obtained microﬁnance data of Bolivia from several sources  such as ASOFIN  the apex
body of MFIs in Bolivia  and the Central Bank of Bolivia. 4 We were only able to collect somewhat
coarse  region-level data (June 2011). It consists of eight MFIs operating in 10 regions.
Computational Results. We ﬁrst choose a value of λ such that the objective function value of the
learning optimization is low as well as “stable” and the interest rates are also relatively dissimilar.
Using this value of λ  the learned ej’s and dj’s capture the variation among the villages w.r.t. the
revenue generation function. The learned loan allocations closely approximate the observed alloca-
tions. The learned model matches each MFI’s total loan allocations due to the learning scheme.

Issues of Bias and Variance. Our dataset consists of a single sample. As a result  the traditional
approach of performing cross validation using hold-out sets or plotting learning curves by varying
the number of samples do not work in our setting. Instead  we systematically introduce noise to
the observed data sample. In the case of overﬁtting  increasing the level of noise would lead the
equilibrium outcome to be signiﬁcantly different from the observed data. To that end  we used two
noise models–Gaussian and Dirichlet. In both cases  the training and test errors are very low and the
learning curves do not suggest overﬁtting.

Equilibrium Selection.
In the case of multiple equilibria  our learning scheme biases its search
for an equilibrium point that most closely explains the data. However  does the equilibrium point
change drastically when noise is added to data? For this  we extended the above procedure using
a bootstrapping scheme to measure the distance between different equilibrium points when noise is
added. For both Gaussian and Dirichlet noise models  we found that the equilibrium point does not
change much even with a high degree of noise. Details  including plots  are given in Appendix E.
Case Study: Bangladesh
Based on the microﬁnance data (consisting of seven MFIs and 464 villages/regions)  dated Decem-
ber 2005  from Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation (PKSF)  which is the apex body of NGO MFIs in
Bangladesh  we have obtained very similar results to the Bolivia case (see Appendix E).

6 Policy Experiments

For a speciﬁc intervention policy  e.g.  removal of government-owned MFIs  we ﬁrst learn the pa-
rameters of the model and then compute an equilibrium point  both in the original setting (before
removal of any MFI). Using the parameters learned  we compute a new equilibrium point after the
removal of the government-owned MFIs. Finally  we study changes in these two equilibria (before
and after removal) in order to predict the effect of such an intervention.
Role of subsidies. MFIs are very much dependent on subsidies [9  20]. We ask a related question:
how does giving subsidies to an MFI affect the market? For instance  one of the Bolivian MFIs
named Eco Futuro exhibits very high interest rates both in observed data and at an equilibrium point.
Eco Futuro is connected to all the villages  but has very little total loan to be disbursed compared to
the leading MFI Bancosol. Using our model  if we inject further subsidies into Eco Futuro to make
its total loan amount equal to Bancosol’s  not only do these two MFIs have the same (but lower than
before) equilibrium interest rates  it also drives down the interest rates of the other MFIs.
Changes in interest rates. Our model computes lower equilibrium interest rate (around 12%) for
ASA than its observed interest rate (15%). It is interesting to note that in late 2005  ASA lowered its
interest rate from 15% to 12.5%  which is close to what our model predicts at an equilibrium point. 5
Interest rates ceiling. PKSF recently capped the interest rates of its partner organization to 12.5%
[23]  and more recently  the country’s Microﬁnance Regulatory Authority has also imposed a ceiling
on interest rate at around 13.5% ﬂat. 6 Such evidence on interest rate ceiling is consistent with the
outcome of our model  since in our model  13.4975% is the highest equilibrium interest rate.
Government-owned MFIs. Many of the government-owned MFIs are loss-making [26]. Our model
shows that removing government-owned MFIs from the market would result in an increase of equi-
librium interest rates by approximately 0.5% for every other MFI. It suggests that less competition
leads to higher interest rates  which is consistent with empirical ﬁndings [23].
Adding new branches. Suppose that MFI Fassil in Bolivia expands its business to all villages. It
may at ﬁrst seem that due to the increase in competition  equilibrium interest rates would go down.
However  since Fassil’s total amount of loan does not change  the new connections and the ensuing
increase in demand actually increase equilibrium interest rates of all MFIs.
Other types of intervention. Through our model  we can ask more interesting questions such as
would an interest rate ceiling be still respected after the removal of certain MFIs from the market?
Surprisingly  according to our discussion above  the answer is yes if we were to remove government-
owned MFIs. Similarly  we can ask what would happen if a major MFI gets entirely shut down? We
can also evaluate effects of subsidies from the donor’s perspective (e.g.  which MFIs should a donor
select and how should the donor distribute its grants among these MFIs in order to achieve some
goal). Causal questions like these form the long-term goal of this research.
