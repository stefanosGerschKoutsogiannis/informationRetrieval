Abstract

The computational modelling of the primary auditory cortex (A1) has been less
fruitful than that of the primary visual cortex (V1) due to the less organized prop-
erties of A1. Greater disorder has recently been demonstrated for the tonotopy of
A1 that has traditionally been considered to be as ordered as the retinotopy of V1.
This disorder appears to be incongruous  given the uniformity of the neocortex;
however  we hypothesized that both A1 and V1 would adopt an efﬁcient coding
strategy and that the disorder in A1 reﬂects natural sound statistics. To provide a
computational model of the tonotopic disorder in A1  we used a model that was
originally proposed for the smooth V1 map. In contrast to natural images  natural
sounds exhibit distant correlations  which were learned and reﬂected in the disor-
dered map. The auditory model predicted harmonic relationships among neigh-
bouring A1 cells; furthermore  the same mechanism used to model V1 complex
cells reproduced nonlinear responses similar to the pitch selectivity. These results
contribute to the understanding of the sensory cortices of different modalities in a
novel and integrated manner.

1 Introduction

Despite the anatomical and functional similarities between the primary auditory cortex (A1) and the
primary visual cortex (V1)  the computational modelling of A1 has proven to be less fruitful than V1 
primarily because the responses of A1 cells are more disorganized. For instance  the receptive ﬁelds
of V1 cells are localized within a small portion of the ﬁeld of view [1]  whereas certain A1 cells have
receptive ﬁelds that are not localized  as these A1 cells demonstrate signiﬁcant responses to multiple
distant frequencies [2  3]. An additional discrepancy that has recently been discovered between these
two regions relates to their topographic structures  i.e.  the retinotopy of V1 and the tonotopy of A1;
these structures had long been considered to be quite similar  but studies on a microscopic scale have
demonstrated that in mice  the tonotopy of A1 is much more disordered [4  5] than the retinotopy
of V1 [6  7]. This result is consistent with previous investigations involving other species [8  9] 
suggesting that the discrepancy in question constitutes a general tendency among mammals. This
disorderliness appears to pose signiﬁcant difﬁculties for the development of computational models
of A1.

A number of computational modelling studies have emphasized the close associations between V1
cells and natural image statistics  which suggests that the V1 adopts an unsupervised  efﬁcient coding
strategy [10]. For instance  the receptive ﬁelds of V1 simple cells were reproduced by either sparse
coding [11] or the independent component analysis [12] of natural images. This line of research
yields explanations for the two-dimensional topography  the orientation and retinotopic maps of
V1 [13  14  15]. Similar efforts to address A1 have been attempted by only a few studies  which
demonstrated that the efﬁcient coding of natural  harmonic sounds  such as human voices or piano

1

recordings  can explain the basic receptive ﬁelds of A1 cells [16  17] and their harmony-related
responses [18  19]. However  these studies have not yet addressed the topography of A1.

In an integrated and computational manner  the present paper attempts to explain why the tonotopy
of A1 is more disordered than the retinotopy of V1. We hypothesized that V1 and A1 still share an
efﬁcient coding strategy  and we therefore proposed that the distant correlations in natural sounds
would be responsible for the relative disorder in A1. To test this hypothesis  we ﬁrst demonstrated
the signiﬁcant differences between natural images and natural sounds. Natural images and natural
sounds were then each used as inputs for topographic independent component analysis  a model that
had previously been proposed for the smooth topography of V1  and maps were generated for these
images and sounds. Due to the distant correlations of natural sounds  greater disorder was observed
in the learned map that had been adapted to natural sounds than in the analogous map that had
been adapted to images. For natural sounds  this model not only predicted harmonic relationships
between neighbouring cells but also demonstrated nonlinear responses that appeared similar to the
responses of the pitch-selective cells that were recently found in A1. These results suggest that the
apparently dissimilar topographies of V1 and A1 may reﬂect statistical differences between natural
images and natural sounds; however  these two regions may employ a common adaptive strategy.

2 Methods

2.1 Topographic independent component analysis

Herein  we discuss an unsupervised learning model termed topographic independent component
analysis (TICA)  which was originally proposed for the study of V1 topography [13  14]. This
model comprises two layers: the ﬁrst layer of N units models the linear responses of V1 simple
cells  whereas the second layer of N units models the nonlinear responses of V1 complex cells  and
the connections between the layers deﬁne a topography. Given a whitened input vector I(x) ∈ Rd
(here  d = N)  the input is reconstructed by the linear superposition of a basis ai ∈ Rd  each of
which corresponds to the ﬁrst-layer units

∑

I =

where si ∈ R are activity levels of the units or model neurons. Inverse ﬁlters wi to determine si can
typically be obtained  and thus si = I T wi (inner product). Using the activities of the ﬁrst layer  the
activities of the second-layer units ci ∈ R can be deﬁned as follows:

where h(i  j) is the neighbourhood function that takes the value of 1 if i and j are neighbours
and is 0 otherwise. The neighbourhood is deﬁned by a square window (e.g.  5 × 5) in cases of
two-dimensional topography. The learning of wi is accomplished through the minimization of the
energy function E or the negative log likelihood:

2.1.1 An extension for overcomplete representation

Ma and Zhang [15] extended the TICA model to account for overcomplete representations (d < N) 
which are observed in the V1 of primates. In this extension  inverse ﬁlters cannot be uniquely de-
ﬁned; therefore  a set of ﬁrst-layer responses si to an input is computed by minimizing the following
extended energy function:

where λ is the relative weight of the activity sparseness  in accordance with sparse coding [11]. The
initial value of si is set equal to the inner product of I and ai. Every 256 inputs  the basis is updated
using the following gradient. In this study  we used the learning rate η = 0.08.

To compare the degrees of disorder in topographies of different modalities  we deﬁned a discontinu-
ity index (DI) for each point i of the maps. Features deﬁning a topography f (i) (e.g.  a retinotopic
position or a frequency) were normalized to the range of [0  1]. Features f (j) within the neighbour-
hood of the ith unit deﬁned by h(i  j) were linearly ﬁtted using the least squares method  and the DI
value at i was then determined using the following equation:

√∑

DI(i) =

NNB

where r(j) is the residual error of linear regression at j and NNB is the number of units within a
neighbourhood window. If the input space is a torus (see Section 3.3)  another DI value is computed
using modiﬁed f values that are increased by 1 if they were initially within [0  1
2 )  and the smaller
of the calculated DI values is used.

3 Results

3.1 Correlations of natural images and natural sounds

Given that V1 is supposed to adapt to natural images and that A1 is supposed to adapt to natural
sounds  the ﬁrst analysis in this study simply compared statistics for natural images and natural
sounds. The natural images were taken from the van Hateren database [20] and were reduced four
times from their original size. Vertical arrays of 120 pixels each were extracted from the reduced

images  each of which covered approximately 8
15 of the vertical range of the human ﬁeld of
view). Figure 1A (right) illustrates the correlation matrix for these images  which is a simple struc-
◦
ture that contains local correlations that span approximately 6
. This result was not surprising  as
distant pixels typically depict different objects.

For natural sounds  we used human narratives from the Handbook of the International Phonetic
Association [21]  as efﬁcient representations of human voices have been successful in facilitating
studies of various components of the auditory system [22  23]  including A1 [16  17]. After these
sounds were downsampled to 4 kHz  their spectrograms were generated using the NSL toolbox
[24] to approximate peripheral auditory processing. Short-time spectra were extracted from the
spectrograms  each of which were 128 pixels wide on a logarithmic scale (24 pixels = 1 octave).
Note that the frequency range (> 5 octaves) spans approximately half of a typical mammalian
hearing range (∼ 10 octaves [25])  whereas the image pixel array spans only 1
15 of the ﬁeld of view.
Figure 1B illustrates the correlation matrix for these sounds  which is a complex structure that incor-
porates distant  off-diagonal correlations. The most prominent off-diagonal correlation  which was
just 1 octave away from the main diagonal  corresponded to the second harmonic of a sound  i.e. 
frequencies at a ratio of 1:2. Similarly  other off-diagonal peaks indicated correlations due to higher
harmonics  i.e.  frequencies that were related to each other by simple integral ratios. These distant
correlations represent relatively typical results for natural sounds and differ greatly from the strictly
local correlations observed for natural images.

3.2 Greater disorder for the tonotopy than the retinotopy

To test the hypothesis that V1 and A1 share a learning strategy  the TICA model was applied to
natural images and natural sounds  which exhibit different statistical proﬁles  as discussed above.

toriness” pa. Three lines: the quartiles (25  50 (bold)  and 75%) obtained from 100 iterations.

Learning with natural images was accomplished in accordance with the original TICA study [13 
14]. Images from the van Hateren database were reduced four times from their original size  and
25 × 25 pixel image patches were randomly extracted (n = 50 000). The patches were whitened and
bandpassed by applying principal component analysis  whereby we selected 400 components and
rejected certain components with low variances and the three components with the largest variances
[13]. The topography was a 20 × 20 torus  and the neighbourhood window was 5 × 5.
Figure 2A illustrates the visual topographic map obtained from this analysis  a small square of which
constitutes a basis vector ai. As previously observed in the original TICA study [13  14]  each unit
was localized  oriented  and bandpassed; thus  these units appeared to be organized similarly to
the receptive ﬁelds of V1 simple cells. The orientation and position of the units changed smoothly
with the coordinates that were examined  which suggested that this map evinces an ordered topog-
raphy. To quantify the retinotopic discontinuity  each unit was ﬁtted using a two-dimensional Gabor
function  and DI was calculated using the y values of the centre coordinates of the resulting Gabor
functions as the features. Figure 2B graphically indicates that the obtained DI values were quite low 
which is consistent with the smooth retinotopy illustrated in Figure 2D.

Next  another TICA model was applied to natural sounds to create an auditory topographic map that
could be compared to the visual topography. As detailed in the previous section  spectrograms of
human voices (sampled at 8 kHz) were generated using the NSL toolbox to approximate peripheral
auditory processing. Spectrogram patches of 200 ms (25 pixels) in width were randomly extracted
(n = 50 000) and vertically reduced from 128 to 25 pixels  which enabled these spectrogram patches
to be directly compared with the image patches. The sound patches were whitened  bandpassed  and
adapted using the model in the same manner as was described for the image patches.

Figure 2C shows the resulting auditory topographic map  which is composed of spectro-temporal
units of ai that are represented by small squares. The units were localized temporally and spectrally 
and some units demonstrated multiple  harmonic peaks; thus  these units appeared to reasonably
represent the typical spectro-temporal receptive ﬁelds of A1 cells [16  3]. The frequency to which
an auditory neuron responds most signiﬁcantly is called its characteristic frequency (CF) [2]. In this
analysis  the CF of a unit was deﬁned as the frequency that demonstrated the largest absolute value
for the unit in question. Figure 2F illustrates the spatial distribution of CFs  i.e.  the tonotopic map.
Within local regions  the tonotopy was not necessarily smooth  i.e.  neighbouring units displayed
distant CFs. However  at a global level  a smooth tonotopy was observed (Figure 2E). Both of these
ﬁndings are consistent with established experimental results [4  5]. The distribution of tonotopic DI
values is shown in Figure 2B  which clearly demonstrates that the tonotopy was more disordered
than the retinotopy (p < 0.0001; Wilcoxon rank test).

3.3 The topographic disorder due to distant input correlations

The previous section demonstrated that natural sounds could induce greater topographic disorder
than natural images  and this section discusses the attempts to elucidate the disorder resulting from a
speciﬁc characteristic of natural sounds  namely  distant correlations. For this purpose  we generated
artiﬁcial inputs (d = 16) with a parameter pa ∈ [0  1] that regulates the degree of distant correlations.

tion of distance and CF difference between two units. (B) The distribution of CF differences within
neighbourhoods (the red-dotted rectangle in (A)). There were three peaks that indicate harmonic
relationships between neighbouring units. The distances were jittered to obtain the visualization.

After the inputs were initially generated from a standard normal distribution  a constant value of 4
was added at k points of each input  where k was from a uniform distribution over {3  4  5  6} and
the points’ coordinates x were from a normal distribution with a random centre and σ = 2. After
adding this constant value at x  we also added another at xdist = x + 5 with a probability pa that
deﬁnes its “auditoriness”  i.e.  its degree of distant correlations. For greater simplicity and to avoid
border effects  the input space was deﬁned to be a one-dimensional torus. The topography was also
set as a one-dimensional torus of 16 units with a neighbourhood window size of 5.
Figure 3 shows the positive correlation between the input “auditoriness” pa and the DI of the learned
topographies. In computations of DI  the feature f of a unit was considered to be its peak coordinate
with the largest absolute value  and a toric input space was used (Section 2.2). If the input only
demonstrated local correlations like visual stimuli (pa ∼ 0)  then its learned topography was smooth
(i.e.  its DI was low). The DI values generally increased as distant correlations appeared more
frequently  i.e.  more “auditoriness” of the inputs grew. Thus  the topographic disorder of auditory
maps results from distant correlations presented by natural auditory signals.

3.4 The harmonic relationship among neighbouring units

Several experiments [4  5] have reported that the CFs of neighbouring cells can differ by up to 4
octaves  although these studies have failed to provide additional detail regarding the local spatial
patterns of the CF distributions. However  if the auditory topography is representative of natural
stimulus statistics  the topographic map is likely to possess certain additional spatial features that
reﬂect the statistical characteristics of natural sounds.

To enable a detailed investigation of the CF distribution  we employed a model that had been adapted
to ﬁner frequency spectra of natural sounds  and this model was then used throughout the remainder
of the study. As the temporal structure of the auditory receptive ﬁelds was less dominant than their
spectral structure (Figure 2C)  we focused solely on the spectral domain and did not attempt to ad-
dress temporal information. Therefore  the inputs for the new model (n = 100 000) were short-time
frequency spectra of 128 pixels each (24 pixels = 1 octave). The data for these spectra were ﬁrst
obtained from the spectrograms of human voices (8 kHz) using the method detailed in Section 3.1 
and these data were then whitened  bandpassed  and reduced to 100 dimensions prior to input into
the model. To illustrate patterns more clearly  the results shown below were obtained using the
overcomplete extension of TICA described in Section 2.1.1  which included a 14 × 14 torus (ap-
proximately 2× overcomplete) and 3×3 windows. The CF of a unit was determined using pure-tone
inputs of 128 frequencies.
Figure 4A illustrates the full distribution of the distance and CF difference between two units in a
learned topography. The CFs of even neighbouring units differed by up to ∼ 4 octaves  which is
consistent with recent experimental ﬁndings [4  5]. A closer inspection of the red-dotted rectangular
region of Figure 4A is shown in Figure 4B. The histogram in Figure 4B demonstrates several peaks

at harmony-related CF differences  such as 0.59 (= log2 1.5)  1.0 (= log2 2; the largest peak)  and
1.59 (= log2 3). These examples indicate that CFs of neighbouring units did not differ randomly 
but tended to be harmonically related. A careful inspection of published data (Figure 5d from [5])
suggests that this relationship may be discernible in those published results; however  the magnitude
of non-harmonic relationships cannot be clearly established from the inspection of this previously
published study  as the stimuli used by the relevant experiment [5] were separated by an interval of
0.25 octaves and were therefore biased towards being harmonic. Thus  this prediction of a harmonic
relationship in neighbouring CFs will need to be examined in more detailed investigations.

3.5 Nonlinear responses similar to pitch-selectivity

Psychoacoustics have long demonstrated interesting phenomena related to harmony  namely  the
perception of pitch  which represents a subjective attribute of perceived sounds. Forming a rigid
deﬁnition for the notion of pitch is difﬁcult; however  if a tone consists of a stack of harmonics
(f0  2f0  3f0  . . .)  then its pitch is the frequency of the lowest harmonic  which is called the fun-
damental frequency f0. The perception of pitch is known to remain constant even if the sound
lacks power at lower harmonics; in fact  pitch at f0 can be perceived from a sound that lacks f0 
a phenomenon known as “missing fundamental” [26]. Nonlinear pitch-selective responses similar
to this perception have recently been demonstrated in certain A1 neurons [27] that localize in the
low-frequency area of the global tonotopy.

To investigate pitch-related responses  previously described complex tones [27] that consisted of
harmonics were selected as inputs for the model described in Section 3.4. For each unit  responses
were calculated to complex tones termed missing fundamental complex tones (MFs) [27]. The MFs
were composed of three consecutive harmonics sharing a single f0; the lowest frequency for these
consecutive harmonics varied from the fundamental frequency (f0) to the tenth harmonic (10f0)  as
shown in Figure 5A. For each unit  ﬁve patterns of f0 around its CF (∼ 0.2 octave) were tested 
resulting in a total of 10 × 5 = 50 variations of MFs. The activity of a unit was normalized to
its maximum response to the MFs. Pitch-selective units were deﬁned as those that signiﬁcantly
responded (normalized activity > 0.4) to all of the MFs sharing a single f0 with a lowest harmonic
from 1 to 4.

We found certain pitch-selective units in the second layer (n = 66; 6 simulations)  whereas none
were found in the ﬁrst layer. Figure 5B illustrates the response proﬁles of the pitch-selective units 
which demonstrated sustained activity for MFs with a lowest harmonic below the sixth harmonic
(6f0)  and this result is similar to previously published data [27]. Additionally  these units were
located in a low-frequency region of the global tonotopy  as shown in Figure 5C  and this feature of
pitch-selective units is also consistent with previous ﬁndings [27]. The second layer of the TICA
model  which contained the pitch-selective units  was originally designed to represent the layer of V1
complex cells  which have nonlinear responses that can be modelled by a summation of “energies”
of neighbouring simple cells [13  14  15]. Our result suggests that the mechanism underlying V1
complex cells may be similar to the organizational mechanism for A1 pitch-selective cells.

4 Discussion

Using a single model  we have provided a computational account explaining why the tonotopy of A1
is more disordered than the retinotopy of V1. First  we demonstrated that there are signiﬁcant differ-
ences between natural images and natural sounds; in particular  the latter evince distant correlations 
whereas the former do not. The topographic independent component analysis therefore generated
a disordered tonotopy for these sounds  whereas the retinotopy adapted to natural images was lo-
cally organized throughout. Detailed analyses of the TICA model predicted harmonic relationships
among neighbouring neurons; furthermore  these analyses successfully replicated pitch selectivity  a
nonlinear response of actual cells  using a mechanism that was designed to model V1 complex cells.
The results suggest that A1 and V1 may share an adaptive strategy  and the dissimilar topographies
of visual and auditory maps may therefore reﬂect signiﬁcant differences in the natural stimuli.

Figure 6 summarizes the ways in which the organizations of V1 and A1 reﬂect these input dif-
ferences. Natural images correlate only locally  which produces a smooth retinotopy through an
efﬁcient coding strategy (Figure 6A). By contrast  natural sounds exhibit additional distant corre-
lations (primarily correlations among harmonics)  which produce the topographic disorganization
observed for A1 (Figure 6B). To extract the features of natural sounds in the auditory pathway  A1
must integrate multiple channels of distant frequencies [2]; for this purpose  the disordered tonotopy
can be beneﬁcial because a neuron can easily collect information regarding distant (and often har-
monically related) frequencies from other cells within its neighbourhood. Our result suggests the
existence of a common adaptive strategy underlying V1 and A1  which would be consistent with
experimental studies that exchanged the peripheral inputs of the visual and auditory systems and
suggested the sensory experiences had a dominant effect on cortical organization [28  29  30].

Our ﬁnal result suggested that a common mechanism may underlie the complex cells of V1 and
the pitch-selective cells of A1. Additional support for this notion was provided by recent evidence
indicating that the pitch-selective cells are most commonly found in the supragranular layer [27] 
and V1 complex cells display a similar tendency. It has been hypothesized that V1 complex cells
collect information from neighbouring cells that are selective to different phases of similar orien-
tations; in an analogous way  A1 pitch-selective cells could collect information from the activities
of neighbouring cells  which in this case could be selective to different frequencies sharing a single
f0. To the best of our knowledge  no previous studies in the literature have attempted to use this
analogy of V1 complex cells to explain A1 pitch-selective cells (however  other potential analogues
have been mentioned [31  32]). Our results and further investigations should help us to understand
these pitch-selective cells from an integrated  computational viewpoint. Another issue that must be
addressed is what functional roles the other units in the second layer play. One possible answer to
this question may be multipeaked responses related to harmony [3]  which have been explained in
part by sparse coding [18  19]; however  this answer has not yet been conﬁrmed by existing evidence
and must therefore be assessed in detail by further investigations.
