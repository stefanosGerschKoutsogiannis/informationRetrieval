Abstract

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be applied to study the func-
tional connectivity of the neural elements which form complex network at a whole
brain level. Most analyses of functional resting state networks (RSN) have been
based on the analysis of correlation between the temporal dynamics of various
regions of the brain. While these models can identify coherently behaving groups
in terms of correlation they give little insight into how these groups interact. In
this paper we take a different view on the analysis of functional resting state net-
works. Starting from the deﬁnition of resting state as functional coherent groups
we search for functional units of the brain that communicate with other parts of
the brain in a coherent manner as measured by mutual information. We use the
inﬁnite relational model (IRM) to quantify functional coherent groups of resting
state networks and demonstrate how the extracted component interactions can be
used to discriminate between functional resting state activity in multiple sclerosis
and normal subjects.

Introduction

Neuronal elements of the brain constitute an intriguing complex network [4]. Functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) can be applied to study the functional connectivity of the neural elements
which form this complex network at a whole brain level. It has been suggested that ﬂuctuations in
the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal during rest reﬂecting the neuronal baseline
activity of the brain correspond to functionally relevant networks [9  3  19].
Most analysis of functional resting state networks (RSN) have been based on the analysis of corre-
lation between the temporal dynamics of various regions of the brain either assessed by how well
voxels correlate with the signal from predeﬁned regions (so-called) seeds [3  24] or through un-
supervised multivariate approaches such as independent component analysis (ICA) [10  9]. While

mutual information is thresholded such that the top 100 000 un-directed links are kept. The graphs
are analyzed by the inﬁnite relational model (IRM) assuming the functional units Z are the same
for all subjects but their interactions ρ(n) are individual. We will use these extracted interactions to
characterize the individuals.

these models identify coherently behaving groups in terms of correlation they give limited insight
into how these groups interact. Furthermore  while correlation is optimal for extracting second order
statistics it easily fails in establishing higher order interactions between regions of the brain [22  7].
In this paper we take a different view on the analysis of functional resting state networks. Starting
from the deﬁnition of resting state as functional coherent groups we search for functional units of the
brain that communicate with other parts of the brain in a coherent manner. Consequently  what de-
ﬁne functional units are the way in which they interact with the remaining parts of the network. We
will consider functional connectivity between regions as measured by mutual information. Mutual
information (MI) is well rooted in information theory and given enough data MI can detect func-
tional relations between regions regardless of the order of the interaction [22  7]. Thereby  resting
state fMRI can be represented as a mutual information graph of pairwise relations between voxels
constituting a complex network. Numerous studies have analyzed these graphs borrowing on ideas
from the study of complex networks [4]. Here common procedures have been to extract various
summary statistics of the networks and compare them to those of random networks and these anal-
yses have demonstrated that fMRI derived graphs behave far from random [11  1  4]. In this paper
we propose to use relational modeling [17  16  27] in order to quantify functional coherent groups
of resting state networks. In particular  we investigate how this line of modeling can be used to
discriminate patients with multiple sclerosis from healthy individuals.
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inﬂammatory disease resulting in widespread demyelinization of the
subcortical and spinal white matter. Focal axonal demyelinization and secondary axonal degenera-
tion results in variable delays or even in disruption of signal transmission along cortico-cortical and
cortico-subcortical connections [21  26]. In addition to the characteristic macroscopic white-matter
lesions seen on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  pathology- and advanced MRI-studies
have shown demyelinated lesions in cortical gray-matter as well as in white-matter that appear nor-
mal on structural MRI [18  12]. These ﬁndings show that demyelination is disseminated throughout
the brain affecting brain functional connectivity. Structural MRI gives information about the extent
of white-matter lesions  but provides no information on the impact on functional brain connectiv-
ity. Given the widespread demyelinization in the brain (i.e.  affecting the brain’s anatomical and
functional ’wiring’) MS represents a disease state which is particular suited for relational modeling.
Here  relational modeling is able to provide a global view of the communication in the functional
network between the extracted functional units. Furthermore  the method facilitates the examina-
tion of all brain networks simultaneously in a completely data driven manner. An illustration of the
proposed analysis is given in ﬁgure 1.

2 Methods

Data: 42 clinically stable patients with relapsing-remitting (RR) and secondary progressive multiple
sclerosis (27 RR; 22 females; mean age: 43.5 years; range 25-64 years) and 30 healthy individuals
(15 females; mean age: 42.6 years; range 22-69 years) participated in this cross-sectional study.
Patients were neurologically examined and assigned a score according to the EDSS which ranged
from 0 to 7 (median EDSS: 4.25; mean disease duration: 14.3 years; range 3-43 years). rs-fMRI
was performed with the subjects being at rest and having their eyes closed (3 Tesla Magnetom Trio 
Siemens  Erlangen  Germany). We used a gradient echo T2*-weighted echo planar imaging se-
quence with whole-brain coverage (repetition time: 2490 ms; 3 mm isotropic voxels). The rs-fMRI
session lasted 20 min (482 brain volumes). During the scan session the cardiac and respiratory cy-
cles were monitored using a pulse oximeter and a pneumatic belt.
Preprocessing: After exclusion of 2 pre-saturation volumes each remaining volume was realigned
to the mean volume using a rigid body transformation. The realigned images were then normalized
to the MNI template. In order to remove nuisance effects related to residual movement or physio-
logical effects a linear ﬁlter comprised of 24 motion related and a total of 60 physiological effects
(cardiac  respiratory and respiration volume over time) was constructed [14]. After ﬁltering  the
voxel were masked [23] and divided into 5039 voxel groups consisting of 2 × 2 × 2 voxels for the
estimation of pairwise MI.

2.1 Mutual Information Graphs

I(i  j) = (cid:80)

The mutual information between voxel groups i and j is given by

uv Pij(u  v) log Pij (u v)

Pi(u)Pj (u). Thus  the mutual information hinges on the estimation of
the joint density Pij(u  v). Several approaches exists for the estimation of mutual information [25]
ranging from parametric to non-parametric methods such as nearest neighbor density estimators [7]
and histogram methods. The accuracy of both approaches relies on the number of observations
present. We used the histogram approach. We used equiprobable rather than equidistant bins [25]
based on 10 percentiles derived from the individual distribution of each voxel group  i.e. Pi(u) =
10. Pij(u  v) counts the number of co-occurrences of observations from voxels in voxel
Pj(v) = 1
group i that are at bin u while the corresponding voxels from group j are at bin v at time t. As such 
we had a total of 8· 480 = 3840 samples to populate the 100 bins in the joint histogram. To generate
the mutual information graphs for each subject a total of 72·5039·(5039−1)/2 ≈ 1 billion pairwise
MI were evaluated. We thresholded each graph keeping the top 100  000 pairwise MI as links in the
graph. As such  each graph had size 5039× 5039 with a total of 200 000 directed links (i.e. 100  000
undirected link) which resulted in each graph having link density
5039·(5039−1)/2 = 0.0079 while
the total number of links was 72 · 100  000 = 7.2 million links (when counting links only in the one
direction).

Inﬁnite Relational Modeling (IRM)

The importance of modeling brain connectivity and interactions is widely recognized in the litera-
ture on fMRI [13  28  20]. Approaches such as dynamic causal modeling [13]  structural equation
models [20] and dynamic Bayes nets [28] are normally limited to analysis of a few interactions be-
tween known brain regions or predeﬁned regions of interest. The beneﬁts of the current relational
modeling approach are that regions are deﬁned in a completely data driven manner while the method
establishes interaction at a low computational complexity admitting the analysis of large scale brain
networks. Functional connectivity graphs have previously been considered in [6] for the discrim-
ination of schizophrenia. In [24] resting state networks were deﬁned based on normalized graph
cuts in order to derive functional units. While normalized cuts are well suited for the separation of
voxels into groups of disconnected components the method lacks the ability to consider coherent
interaction between groups. In [17] the stochastic block model also denoted the relational model
(RM) was proposed for the identiﬁcation of coherent groups of nodes in complex networks. Here 
each node i belongs to a class zir where ir denote the ith row of a clustering assignment matrix Z 
and the probability  πij  of a link between node i and j is determined by the class assignments zir
jr. Here  ρk(cid:96) ∈ [0  1] denotes the probability of generating a link between
and zjr as πij = zir ρz(cid:62)
a node in class k and a node in class (cid:96). Using the Dirichlet process (DP)  [16  27] propose a non-
parametric generalization of the model with a potentially inﬁnite number of classes  i.e. the inﬁnite

relational model (IRM). Inference in IRM jointly determines the number of latent classes as well as
class assignments and class link probabilities. To our knowledge this is the ﬁrst attempt to explore
the IRM model for fMRI data.
Following [16] we have the following generative model for the inﬁnite relational model

Z|α ∼ DP(α)

ρ(n)(a  b)|β+(a  b)  β−(a  b) ∼ Beta(β+(a  b)  β−(a  b))

A(n)(i  j)|Z  ρ(n) ∼ Bernoulli(zir ρ(n)z(cid:62)

)

jr

As such an entitys tendency to participate in relations is determined solely by its cluster assignment
in Z. Since the prior on the elements of ρ is conjugate the resulting integral

P (A(n)|Z  β+  β−) = (cid:82) P (A(n)|ρ(n)  Z)P (ρ(n)|β+  β−)dρ(n) has an analytical solution such

that

MCMC Sampling the IRM model: As proposed in [16] we use a Gibbs sampling scheme in
combination with split-merge sampling [15] for the clustering assignment matrix Z. We used the
split-merge sampling procedure proposed in [15] with three restricted Gibbs sampling sweeps. We
initialized the restricted Gibbs sampler by the sequential allocation procedure proposed in [8]. For
the MCMC sampling  the posterior likelihood for a node assignment given the assignment of the
remaining nodes is needed both for the Gibbs sampler as well as for calculating the split-merge
acceptance ratios [15].

Scoring the functional units in terms of stability: By sampling we obtain a large amount of
potential solutions  however  for visualization and interpretation it is difﬁcult to average across all
samples as this requires that the extracted groups in different samples and runs can be related to
each other. For visualization we instead selected the single best extracted sample r∗ (i.e.  the MAP
estimate) across 10 separate randomly initialized runs each of 500 iterations.
To facilitate interpretation we displayed the top 20 extracted functional units most reproducible
across the separate runs. To identify these functional units we analyzed how often nodes co-occurred
in the same cluster across the extracted samples from the other random starts r according to C =

(cid:80)
r(cid:54)=r∗ (Z(r)Z(r)(cid:62) − I) using the following score ηc

sc counts the number of times the voxels in group c co-occurred with other voxels in the group
whereas stot gives the total number of times voxels in group c co-occurred with other voxels in the
graph. As such 0 ≤ ηc ≤ 1 where 1 indicates that all voxels in the cth group were in the same
cluster across all samples whereas 0 indicates that the voxels never co-occurred in any of the other
samples.

3 Results and Discussion
Following [11] we calculated the average shortest path length (cid:104)L(cid:105)  average clustering coefﬁcient
(cid:104)C(cid:105)  degree distribution γ and largest connected component (i.e.  giant component) G for each
subject speciﬁc graph as well as the MI threshold value tc used to deﬁne the top 100  000 links. In
table 1 it can be seen that the derived graphs are far from Erd¨os-R´enyi random graphs. Both the
clustering coefﬁcient  degree distribution parameter γ and giant component G differ signiﬁcantly
from the random graphs. However  there are no signiﬁcant differences between the Normal and MS
group indicating that these global features do not appear to be affected by the disease.
For each run  we initialized the IRM model with D = 50 randomly generated functional units.
We set the prior β+(a  b) =
favoring a
priori higher within functional unit link density relative to between link density. We set α = log J
(where J is the number of voxel groups). In the model estimation we treated 2.5% of the links
and an equivalent number of non-links as missing at random in the graphs. When treating entries
as missing at random these can be ignored maintaining counts only over the observed values [16].
The estimated models are very stable as they on average extracted D = 72.6 ± 0.6 functional units.
In ﬁgure 2 the area under curve (AUC) scores of the receiver operator characteristic for predicting
links are given for each subject where the prediction of links was based on averaging over the ﬁnal
100 samples. While these AUC scores are above random for all subjects we see a high degree of
variability across the subjects in terms of the model’s ability to account for links and non-links in
the graphs. We found no signiﬁcant difference between the Normal and MS group in terms of the

model’s ability to account for the network dynamics. Thus  there seem to be no difference in terms
of how well the IRM model is able to account for structure in the networks of MS and Normal
subjects. Finally  we see that the link prediction is surprisingly stable for each subject across runs as
well as links and non-links treated as missing. This indicate that there is a high degree of variability
in the graphs extracted from resting state fMRI between the subjects relative to the variability within
each subject.
Considering the inference a stochastic optimization procedure we have visualized the sample with
highest likelihood (i.e. the MAP estimate) over the runs in ﬁgure 3. We display the top 20 most
reproducible extracted voxel groups (i.e.  functional units) across the 10 runs. Fifteen of the 20
functional units are easily identiﬁed as functionally relevant networks. These selected functional
units are similar to the networks previously identiﬁed on resting-state fMRI data using ICA [9].
The sensori-motor network is represented by the functional units 2  3  13 and 20; the posterior part
of the default-mode network [19] by functional units 6  14  16  19; a fronto-parietal network by the
functional units 7 10 and 12; the visual system represented by the functional units 5  11  15  18. Note
the striking similarity to the sensori-motor ICA1  posterior part of the default network ICA2 and
fronto-parietal network ICA3 and visual component ICA4. Contrary to ICA the current approach is
able to also model interactions between components and a consistent pattern is revealed where the
functional units with the highest within connectivity also show the strongest between connectivity.
Furthermore the functional units appear to have symmetric connectivity proﬁles e.g. functional unit
2 is strongly connected to functional unit 3 (sensori-motor system)  and these both strongly connect
to the same other functional units  in this case 6 and 16 (default-mode network). Functional units
1  4  8  9  17 we attribute to vascular noise and these units appear to be less connected with the
remaining functional units.
In panel C of ﬁgure 3 we tested the difference between medians in the connectivity of the extracted
functional units. Given are connections that are signiﬁcant at p ≤ 0.05. Healthy individuals show
stronger connectivity among selected functional units relative to patients. The functional units in-
volved are distributed throughout the brain and comprise the visual system (functional unit 5 and 11) 
the sensori-motor network (functional unit 2)  and the fronto-parietal network (functional unit 10).
This is expected since MS affects the brain globally by white-matter changes disseminated through-
out the brain [12]. Patients with MS show stronger connectivity relative to healthy individuals
between selected parts of the sensori-motor (functional unit 13) and fronto-parietal network (func-
tional units 7 and 12). An interpretation of this ﬁnding could be that the communication increases
between the fronto-parietal and the sensori-motor network either as a maladaptive consequence of
the disease or as part of a beneﬁcial compensatory mechanism to maintain motor function.

Discriminating Normal subjects from MS: We evaluated the classiﬁcation performance of the
subject speciﬁc group link densities ρ(n) based on leave one out cross-validation. We considered
three standard classiﬁers  soft margin support vector machine (SVM) with linear kernel (C = 1) 
linear discriminant analysis (LDA) based on the pooled variance estimate (features projected by prin-
cipal component analysis to a 20 dimensional feature space prior to analysis)  as well as K-nearest
neighbor (KNN)  K = 3. We compared the classiﬁer performances to classifying the normalized
raw subject speciﬁc voxel× time series  i.e. the matrix given by subject× voxel− time as well as
the data projected to the most dominant 20 dimensional subspace denoted (PCA). For comparison
we also included a group ICA [5] analysis as well as the performance using node degree (Degree)
as features which has previously been very successful for classiﬁcation of schizophrenia [6]. For
the IRM model we used the Bayesian average over predictions which was dominated by the MAP
estimate given in ﬁgure 3. For all the classiﬁcation analyses we normalized each feature. In table
2 is given the classiﬁcation results. Group ICA as well as the proposed IRM model signiﬁcantly
classify above random. The IRM model has a higher classiﬁcation rate and is signiﬁcant across all
the classiﬁers.
Finally  we note that contrary to analysis based on temporal correlation such as the ICA and PCA
approaches used for the classiﬁcation the beneﬁt of mutual information is that it can take higher
order dependencies into account that are not necessarily reﬂected by correlation. As such  a brain
region driven by the variance of another brain region can be captured by mutual information whereas
this is not necessarily captured by correlation.

4 Conclusion

The functional units extracted using the IRM model correspond well to previously described RSNs
[19  9]. Whereas conventional models for assessing functional connectivity in rs-fMRI data often
aim to divide the brain into segregated networks the IRM explicitly models relations between func-
tional units enabling visualization and analysis of interactions. Using classiﬁcation models to predict
the subject disease state revealed that the IRM model had a higher prediction rate than discrimina-
tion based on the components extracted from a conventional group ICA approach [5]. IRM readily
extends to directed graphs and networks derived from task related functional activation. As such
we believe the proposed method constitutes a promising framework for the analysis of functionally
derived brain networks in general.
