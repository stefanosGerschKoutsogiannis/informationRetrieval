Abstract

We construct a biologically motivated stochastic differential model of the neu-
ral and hemodynamic activity underlying the observed Blood Oxygen Level De-
pendent (BOLD) signal in Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The
model poses a difﬁcult parameter estimation problem  both theoretically due to the
nonlinearity and divergence of the differential system  and computationally due to
its time and space complexity. We adapt a particle ﬁlter and smoother to the task 
and discuss some of the practical approaches used to tackle the difﬁculties  includ-
ing use of sparse matrices and parallelisation. Results demonstrate the tractability
of the approach in its application to an effective connectivity study.

1 Introduction
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) poses a large-scale  noisy and altogether difﬁcult
problem for machine learning algorithms. The Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal 
from which fMR images are produced  is a measure of hemodynamic activity in the brain – only an
indirect indicator of the neural processes which are of primary interest in most cases.
For studies of higher level patterns of activity  such as effective connectivity [1]  it becomes neces-
sary to strip away the hemodynamic activity to reveal the underlying neural interactions. In the ﬁrst
instance  this is because interactions between regions at the neural level are not necessarily evident at
the hemodynamic level [2]. In the second  analyses increasingly beneﬁt from the temporal qualities
of the data  and the hemodynamic response itself is a form of temporal blurring.
We are interested in the application of machine learning techniques to reveal meaningful patterns
of neural activity from fMRI. In this paper we construct a model of the processes underlying the
BOLD signal that is suitable for use in a ﬁltering framework. The model proposed is close to that
of Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) [3]. The main innovation over these deterministic models is
the incorporation of stochasticity at all levels of the system. This is important; under ﬁxed inputs 
DCM reduces to a generative model with steady state equilibrium BOLD activity and independent
noise at each time point. Incorporating stochasticity allows proper statistical characterisation of the
dependence between brain regions  rather than relying on relating decay rates1.
Our work has involved applying a number of ﬁltering techniques to estimate the parameters of
the model  most notably the Unscented Kalman Filter [4] and various particle ﬁltering techniques.
This paper presents the application of a simple particle ﬁlter. [5] take a similar ﬁltering approach 
applying a local linearisation ﬁlter [6] to a model of individual regions. In contrast  the approach
here is applied to multiple regions and their interactions  not single regions in isolation.
Other approaches to this type of problem are worth noting. Perhaps the most commonly used tech-
nique to date is Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) [7; 8] (e.g. [9; 10; 11]). SEM is a multivariate
1A good analogy is the fundamental difference between modelling time series data yt using an exponentially
decaying curve with observational noise xt = axt−1 +c  yt = xt +t  and using a much more ﬂexible Kalman
ﬁlter xt = axt−1 + c + ωt  yt = xt + t (where xt is a latent variable  a a decay constant  c a constant and 
and ω Gaussian variables).

regression technique where each dependent variable may be a linear combination of both indepen-
dent and other dependent variables. Its major limitation is that it is static  assuming that all observa-
tions are temporally independent and that interactions are immediate and wholly evident within each
single observation. Furthermore  it does not distinguish between neural and hemodynamic activity 
and in essence identiﬁes interactions only at the hemodynamic level.
The major contributions of this paper are establishing a stochastic model of latent neural and hemo-
dynamic activity  formulating a ﬁltering and smoothing approach for inference in this model  and
overcoming the basic practical difﬁculties associated with this. The estimated neural activity relates
to the domain problem and is temporally consistent with the stimulus. The approach is also able to
establish connectivity relationships.
The ability of this model to establish such connectivity relationships on the basis of stochastic tem-
poral relationships is signiﬁcant. One problem in using structural equation models for effective
connectivity analysis is the statistical equivalence of different causal models. By presuming a tem-
poral causal order  temporal models of this form have no such equivalence problems. Any small
amount of temporal connectivity information available in fMRI data is of signiﬁcant beneﬁt  as it
can disambiguate between statically equivalent models.
Section 2 outlines the basis of the hemodynamic model that is used. This is combined with neural 
input and measurement models in Section 3 to give the full framework. Inference and parameter
estimation are discussed in Section 4  before experiments and analysis in Sections 5 and 6.
2 Hemodynamics
Temporal analysis of fMRI is signiﬁcantly confounded by the fact that it does not measure brain
activity directly  but instead via hemodynamic activity  which (crudely) temporally smooths the
activity signal. The quality of temporal analysis therefore depends signiﬁcantly on the quality of
model used to relate neural and hemodynamic activity.
This relationship may be described using the now well established Balloon model [12]. This models
a venous compartment as a balloon using Windkessel dynamics. The state of the compartment is
represented by its blood volume normalised to the volume at rest  v = V /V0 (blood volume V   rest
volume V0)  and deoxyhemoglobin (dHb) content normalised to the content at rest  q = Q/Q0 (dHb
content Q  rest content Q0). The compartment receives inﬂow of fully oxygenated arterial blood
fin(t)  extracts oxygen from the blood  and expels partially deoxygenated blood fout(t). The full
dynamics may be represented by the differential system:

This base model is driven by the independent input fin(t). It may be further extended to couple in

3 Model
We deﬁne a model of the neural and hemodynamic interactions between M regions of interest. A
region consists of neural tissue and a venous compartment. The state xi(t) of region i at time t is
given by:



xi(t) =

fi(t) normalised blood ﬂow into the venous compartment
si(t)
qi(t)
vi(t)

vasodilatory signal
normalised dHb content of the venous compartment
normalised blood volume of the venous compartment

Input model

The complete state at time t is given by x(t) = (x1(t)T   . . .   xM (t)T )T .
We construct a model of the interactions between regions in four parts – the input model  the neural
model  the hemodynamic model and the measurement model.
3.1
The input model represents the stimulus associated with the experimental task during an fMRI ses-
sion. In general this is a function u(t) with U dimensions. For a simple block design paradigm a
one-dimensional box-car function is sufﬁcient.
3.2 Neural model
Neural interactions between the regions are given by:

dz = Az dt + Cu dt + c + Σz dW 

(8)
where dW is the M-dimensional standard (zero mean  unit variance) Wiener process  A an M × M
matrix of efﬁcacies between regions  C an M × U matrix of efﬁcacies between inputs and regions 
c an M-dimensional vector of constant terms and Σz an M × M diagonal diffusion matrix with
σz1  . . .   σzM along the diagonal.
This is similar to the deterministic neural model of DCM expressed as a stochastic differential equa-
tion  but excludes the bilinear components allowing modulation of connections between seeds. In
theory these can be added  we simply limit ourselves to a simpler model for this early work. In
addition  and unlike DCM  nonlinear interactions between regions could also be included to account
for modulatory activity. Again it seems sensible to keep the simplest linear case at this stage of
the work  but the potential for nonlinear generalisation is one of the longer term beneﬁts of this
approach.
3.3 Hemodynamic model
Within each region  the variables fi  si  qi  vi and zi interact according to a stochastic extension of
the balloon model (c.f. Equations 1-6). It is assumed that regions are sufﬁciently separate that their

This may be converted to an absolute measurement y∗

y∗
i = bi(1 + ∆yi) + σyi ξ.

4 Estimation
The model is completely deﬁned by Equations 8 to 14. This ﬁts nicely into a ﬁltering framework 
whereby the input  neural and hemodynamic models deﬁne state transitions  and the measurement
model predicted observations. For i = 1  . . .   M  σzi  σfi  σsi  σqi and σvi deﬁne the system noise
and σyi the measurement noise. Parameters to estimate are the elements of A  C  c and b.
For a sequence of time points t1  . . .   tT   we are given observations y(t1)  . . .   y(tT )  where
y(t) = (y1(t)  . . .   yM (t))T . We seek to exploit the data as much as possible by estimating
P (x(tn)| y(t1)  . . .   y(tT )) for n = 1  . . .   T – the distribution over the state at each time point
given all the data.
Because of non-Gaussianity and nonlinearity of the transitions and measurements  a two-pass parti-
cle ﬁlter is proposed to solve the problem. The forward pass is performed using a sequential impor-
tance resampling technique similar to CONDENSATION [15]  obtaining P (x(tn)| y(t1)  . . .   y(tn))
for n = 1  . . .   T . Resampling at each step is handled using a deterministic resampling method [16].
The transition of particles through the differential system uses a 4th/5th order Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg
method  the adaptive step size maintaining ﬁxed error bounds.
The backwards pass is substantially more difﬁcult. Naively  we can simply negate the derivatives of
the differential system and step backwards to obtain P (x(tn)| y(tn+1)  . . .   y(tT ))  then fuse these
with the results of the forwards pass to obtain the desired posterior. Unfortunately  such a backwards
model is divergent in q and v  so that the accumulated numerical errors of the Runge-Kutta can
easily cause an explosion to implausible values and a tip-toe adaptive step size to maintain error
bounds. This can be mitigated by tightening the error bounds  but the task becomes computationally
prohibitive well before the system is tamed.
An alternative is a two-pass smoother that reuses particles from the forwards pass [17]  reweighting
them on the backwards pass so that no explicit backwards dynamics are required. This sidesteps the
divergence issue completely  but is computationally and spatially expensive and requires computa-
tion of p(x(tn) = s(i)
tn−1. This imposes some
limitations  but is nevertheless the method used here.
The forwards pass provides a weighted sample set {(s(i)
t )} at each time point t = t1  . . .   tT
for i = 1  . . .   P . Initialising with ψtT = πtT   the backwards step to calculate weights at time tn is

These are then normalised so that
is stored.
There are numerous means of propagating particles through the forwards pass that accommodate the
resampling step and propagation of the Wiener noise through the nonlinearity. These include var-
ious stochastic Runge-Kutta methods  the Unscented Transformation [4] or a simple Euler scheme
using ﬁxed time steps and adding an appropriate portion of noise after each step. The requirement to
efﬁciently make P 2 density calculations of p(x(tn+1) = s(i)
tn ) during the backwards
pass is challenging with such approaches  however. To keep things simple  we instead simply prop-
agate particles noiselessly through the transition function  and add noise from the Wiener process
only at times t1  . . .   tT as if the transition were linear. This reasonably approximates the noise of
the system while keeping the density calculations very simple – transition s(j)
tn noiselessly to obtain
the mean value of a Gaussian with covariance equal to that of the system noise  then calculate the
density of this Gaussian at s(i)
Observe that if system noise is sufﬁciently tight  αtn becomes sparse as negligibly small densities
round to zero. Implementing αtn as a sparse matrix can provide signiﬁcant time and space savings.
Propagation of particles through the transition function and density calculations can be performed
in parallel. This applies during both passes. For the backwards pass  each particle at tn need only
be transitioned once to produce a Gaussian from which the density of all particles at tn+1 can be
calculated  ﬁlling in one column of αtn.
Finally  the parameters A  C  c and b may be estimated by adding them to the state with artiﬁcial
dynamics (c.f. [18])  applying a broad prior and small system noise to suggest that they are generally
constant. The same applies to parameters of the balloon model  which may be included to allow
variation in the hemodynamic response across the brain.

5 Experiments
We apply the model to data collected during a simple ﬁnger tapping exercise. Using a Siemens
Vision at 2T with a TR of 4.1s  a healthy 23-year-old right-handed male was scanned on 33 separate
days over a period of two months. In each session  80 whole volumes were taken  with the ﬁrst
two discarded to account for T1 saturation effects. The experimental paradigm consists of alternat-
ing 6TR blocks of rest and tapping of the right index ﬁnger at 1.5Hz  where tapping frequency is
provided by a constant audio cue  present during both rest and tapping phases.
All scans across all sessions were realigned using SPM5 [19] and a two-level random effects analysis
performed  from which 13 voxels were selected to represent regions of interest. No smoothing or
normalisation was applied to the data. Of the 13 voxels  four are selected for use in this experiment
– located in the left posterior parietal cortex  left M1  left S1 and left premotor cortex. The mean
of all sessions is used as the measurement y(t)  which consists of M = 4 elements  one for each
region.
We set t1 = 1TR = 4.1s  . . .   tT = 78TR = 319.8s as the sequence of times  corresponding to
the times at which measurements are taken after realignment. The experimental input function u(t)
is plotted in Figure 2  taking a value of 0 at rest and 1 during tapping. The error bounds on the
Runge-Kutta are set to 10−4. Measurement noise is set to σyi = 2 for i = 1  . . .   M and the prior
and system noise as in Table 2. With the elements of A  C  c and b included in the state  the state
size is 48. P = 106 particles are used for the forwards pass  downsampling to 2.5 × 104 particles
for the more expensive backwards pass.

The experiment is run on the Eddie cluster of the Edinburgh Compute and Data Facility (ECDF) 3
over 200 nodes  taking approximately 10 minutes real time. The particle ﬁlter and smoother are
distributed across nodes and run in parallel using the dysii Dynamic Systems Library 4.
After application of the ﬁlter  the predicted neural activity is given in Figure 4 and parameter esti-
mates in Figures 6 and 7. The predicted output obtained from the model is in Figure 5  where it is
compared to actual measurements acquired during the experiment to assess model ﬁt.
6 Discussion
The model captures the expected underlying form for neural activity  with all regions distinctly
correlated with the experimental stimulus. Parameter estimates are generally constant throughout
the length of the experiment and some efﬁcacies are signiﬁcant enough in magnitude to provide
biological insight. The parameters found typically match those expected for this form of ﬁnger
tapping task. However  as the focus of this paper is the development of the ﬁltering approach we
will reserve a real analysis of the results for a future paper  and focus on the issues surrounding the
ﬁlter and its capabilities and deﬁciencies. A number of points are worth making in this regard.
Particles stored during the forwards pass do not necessarily support the distributions obtained during
the backwards pass. This is particularly obvious towards the extreme left of Figure 4  where the
smoothed results appear to become erratic  essentially due to degeneracy in the backwards pass.
Furthermore  while the smooth weighting of particles in the forwards pass is informative  that of
the backwards pass is often not  potentially relying on heavy weighting of outlying particles and
shedding little light on the actual nature of the distributions involved.
Figure 3 provides empirical results as to the sparseness of αtn. At worst at least 25% of elements
are zero  demonstrating the advantages of a sparse matrix implementation in this case.
The particle ﬁlter is able to establish consistent neural activity and parameter estimates across runs.
These estimates also come with distributions in the form of weighted sample sets which enable the
uncertainty of the estimates to be understood. This certainly shows the stochastic model and particle
ﬁlter to be a promising approach for systematic connectivity analysis.
