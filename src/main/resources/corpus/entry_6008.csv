Abstract

Experiments reveal that in the dorsal medial superior temporal (MSTd) and the
ventral intraparietal (VIP) areas  where visual and vestibular cues are integrated
to infer heading direction  there are two types of neurons with roughly the same
number. One is “congruent" cells  whose preferred heading directions are similar in
response to visual and vestibular cues; and the other is “opposite" cells  whose pre-
ferred heading directions are nearly “opposite" (with an offset of 180◦) in response
to visual vs. vestibular cues. Congruent neurons are known to be responsible for
cue integration  but the computational role of opposite neurons remains largely
unknown. Here  we propose that opposite neurons may serve to encode the dispar-
ity information between cues necessary for multisensory segregation. We build
a computational model composed of two reciprocally coupled modules  MSTd
and VIP  and each module consists of groups of congruent and opposite neurons.
In the model  congruent neurons in two modules are reciprocally connected with
each other in the congruent manner  whereas opposite neurons are reciprocally
connected in the opposite manner. Mimicking the experimental protocol  our model
reproduces the characteristics of congruent and opposite neurons  and demonstrates
that in each module  the sisters of congruent and opposite neurons can jointly
achieve optimal multisensory information integration and segregation. This study
sheds light on our understanding of how the brain implements optimal multisensory
integration and segregation concurrently in a distributed manner.

Introduction

Our brain perceives the external world with multiple sensory modalities  including vision  audition 
olfaction  tactile  vestibular perception and so on. These sensory systems extract information
about the environment via different physical means  and they generate complementary cues (neural
representations) about external objects to the multisensory areas. Over the past years  a large volume
of experimental and theoretical studies have focused on investigating how the brain integrates multiple
sensory cues originated from the same object in order to perceive the object reliably in an ambiguous
environment  the so-called multisensory integration. They found that the brain can integrate multiple
cues optimally in a manner close to Bayesian inference  e.g.  integrating visual and vestibular cues to
infer heading direction [1] and so on [2–4]. Neural circuit models underlying optimal multisensory
integration have been proposed  including a centralized model in which a dedicated processor receives
and integrates all sensory cues [5  6]  and a decentralized model in which multiple local processors
exchange cue information via reciprocal connections  so that optimal cue integration is achieved at
each local processor [7].

However  multisensory integration is only half of the story of multisensory information processing 
which works well when the sensory cues are originated from the same object. In cases where the
sensory cues originate from different objects  the brain should segregate  rather than integrate  the
cues. In a noisy environment  however  the brain is unable to differentiate the two situations at
ﬁrst sight. The brain faces a “chicken vs. egg" dilemma in multisensory integration: without ﬁrst
integrating multiple cues to eliminate uncertainty  the brain is unable to estimate the objects reliably to
differentiate whether the cues are from the same or different objects; but once the cues are integrated 
the disparity information between the cues is lost  and the brain can no longer discriminate objects
clearly when the cues actually come from different objects. To solve this dilemma  here we argue that
the brain needs to carry out multisensory integration and segregation concurrently in the early stage
of information processing  that is  a group of neurons integrates sensory cues while another group of
neurons extracts the cue disparity information  and the interplay between two networks determines
the ﬁnal action: integration vs. segregation. Concurrent processing has the advantage of achieving
rapid object perception if the cues are indeed from the same object  and avoiding information loss if
the cues are from different objects. Psychophysical data tends to support this idea  which shows that
the brain can still sense the difference between cues in multisensory integration [8  9].
What are the neural substrates of the brain to implement concurrent multisensory integration and
segregation? In the experiments of integrating visual and vestibular cues to infer heading direction  it
was found that in the dorsal medial superior temporal area (MSTd) and the ventral intraparietal area
(VIP) which primarily receive visual and vestibular cues respectively  there exist two types of neurons
displaying different cue integrative behaviors [1  10]. One of them is called “congruent" cells  since
their preferred heading directions are similar in response to either a visual or a vestibular cue (Fig. 1A);
and the other type is called “opposite" cells  since their preferred visual and vestibular directions are
nearly “opposite" (with an offset of 180◦  half of the period of direction  Fig. 1B). Data analyses and
modelling studies revealed that congruent neurons are responsible for cue integration [1  10  6  7].
However  the computational role of opposite neurons remains largely unknown  despite the fact that
congruent and opposite neurons are comparably numerous in MSTd and VIP (Fig. 1C). Notably 
the responses of opposite neurons hardly vary when a single cue is replaced by two congruent cues
(i.e.  no cue integration behavior)  whereas their responses increase signiﬁcantly when the disparity
between visual and vestibular cues increases [11]  indicating that opposite neurons may serve to
extract the cue disparity information necessary for multisensory segregation. Motivated by the above
experimental ﬁndings  we explore how multisensory integration and segregation are concurrently
implemented in a neural system via sisters of congruent and opposite cells.

2 Probabilistic Model of Multisensory Information Processing

In reality  because of noise  the brain estimates stimulus information relying on ambiguous cues in a
probabilistic manner. Thus  we formulate multisensory information processing in the framework of
probabilistic inference. The present study mainly focuses on information processing at MSTd and
VIP  where visual and vestibular cues are integrated/segregated to infer heading direction. However 
the main results of this work are applicable to the processing of cues of other modalities.

Because heading direction is a circular variable whose values are in range (−π  π]  we adopt the
von Mises distribution [14] (Supplementary Information Sec. 1). Compared with the Gaussian
distribution  the von Mises distribution is more suitable and also more accurate to describe the
probabilistic inference of circular variables  and furthermore  it gives a clear geometrical interpretation
of multisensory information processing (see below).
Suppose there are two stimuli s1 and s2  each of which generates a sensory cue xm  for m = 1  2
(visual or vestibular)  independently. We call xm the direct cue of sm  and xl (l (cid:54)= m) the indirect
cue to sm. Denote as p(xm|sm) the likelihood function  whose form in von Mises distribution is

(1)

p(xm|sm) =

where I0(κ) = (2π)−1(cid:82) 2π

0 eκ cos(θ)dθ is the modiﬁed Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind and order zero.
sm is the mean of the von Mises distribution  i.e.  the mean value of xm. κm is a positive number
characterizing the concentration of the distribution  which is analogous to the inverse of the variance
(σ−2) of Gaussian distribution. In the limit of large κm  a von Mises distribution M[xm − sm  κm]
approaches to a Gaussian distribution N [xm − sm  κ−1
m ] (SI Sec. 1.2). For small κm  the von Mises
distribution deviates from the Gaussian one (Fig.2A).

2.2 Multisensory integration

We introduce ﬁrst a probabilistic model of Bayes-optimal multisensory integration. Experimental data
revealed that our brain integrates sensory cues optimally in a manner close to Bayesian inference [2].
Assuming that noises in different channels are independent  the posterior distribution of two stimuli
can be written according to Bayes’ theorem as

(2)
where p(s1  s2) is the prior of the stimuli  which speciﬁes the concurrence probability of a stimulus
pair. As an example in the present study  we choose the prior to be

p(s1  s2|x1  x2) ∝ p(x1|s1)p(x2|s2)p(s1  s2) 

p(s1  s2) =

M(s1 − s2  κs) =

1
2π

1

(2π)2I0(κs)

exp [κs cos(s1 − s2)] .

(3)

This form of prior favors the tendency for two stimuli to have similar values. Such a tendency has
been modeled in multisensory integration [7  15–17]. κs determines the correlation between two
stimuli  i.e.  how informative one cue is about the other  and it regulates the extent to which two cues
should be integrated. The fully integrated case  in which the prior becomes a delta function in the
limit κs → ∞  has been modeled in e.g.  [4  5].
Since the results for two stimuli are exchangeable  hereafter  we will only present the result for
s1  unless stated speciﬁcally. Noting that p(sm) = p(xm) = 1/2π are uniform distributions  the
posterior distribution of s1 given two cues becomes

p(s1|x1  x2) ∝ p(x1|s1)

p(x2|s2)p(s2|s1)ds2 ∝ p(s1|x1)p(s1|x2).

(4)

The indirect cue x2 is informative to s1 via the prior p(s1  s2). By using Eqs. (1 3) and under
reasonable approximations (SI Sec. 1.4)  we obtain

(cid:90)

p(x2|s2)p(s2|s1)ds2 (cid:39) M (s1 − x2  κ12)  

−π eκ cos θdθ.

Finally  utilizing Eqs. (1 5)  Eq. (4) is written as

p(s1|x1  x2) ∝ M(s1 − x1  κ1)M(s1 − x2  κ12) = M(s1 − ˆs1  ˆκ1) 

where the mean and concentration of the posterior given two cues are (SI Sec. 1.3)

ˆs1 = atan2(κ1 sin x1 + κ12 sin x2  κ1 cos x1 + κ12 cos x2)

where atan2 is the arctangent function of two arguments (SI Eq. S17).
Eqs. (7 8) are the results of Bayesian integration in the form of von Mises distribution  and they are
the criteria for us to judge whether optimal cue integration is achieved in a neural system.
To understand these optimality criteria intuitively  it is helpful to see their equivalence of the Gaussian
distribution in the limit of large κ1  κ2 and κs. Under the condition x1 ≈ x2  Eq. (8) is approximated
to be ˆκ1 ≈ κ1 + κ12 (SI Sec. 2). Since κ ≈ 1/σ2 when von Mises distribution is approximated as
Gaussian one  Eq. (8) becomes 1/ˆσ2
12  which is the Bayesian prediction on Gaussian
variance conventionally used in the literature [4]. Similarly  Eq. (7) is associated with the Bayesian
prediction on the Gaussian mean [4].

2.3 Multisensory segregation

We introduce next the probabilistic model of multisensory segregation. Inspired by the observation
in multisensory integration that the posterior of a stimulus given combined cues is the product of
the posteriors given each cue (Eq.4)  we propose that in multisensory segregation  the disparity
D(s1|x1; s1|x2) between two cues is measured by the ratio of the posteriors given each cue  that is 
(9)
By taking the expectation of log D over the distribution p(s1|x1)  we get the Kullback-Leibler
divergence between the two posteriors given each cue. This disparity measure was also used to
discriminate alternative moving directions in [18].
Interestingly  by utilizing the property of von Mises distributions and the condition cos(s1 +π−x2) =
− cos(s1 − x2)  Eq. (9) can be rewritten as

D(s1|x1; s1|x2) ≡ p(s1|x1)/p(s1|x2) 

D(s1|x1; s1|x2) ∝ p(s1|x1)p(s1 + π|x2) 

(10)
that is  the disparity information between two cues is proportional to the product of the posterior
given the direct cue and the posterior given the indirect cue but with the stimulus value shifted by π.
By utilizing Eqs. (1 5)  we obtain

D(s1|x1; s1|x2) ∝ M(s1 − x1  κ1)M(s1 + π − x2  κ12) = M (s1 − ∆ˆs1  ∆ˆκ1)  

(11)

where the mean and concentration of the von Mises distribution are

∆ˆκ1 = (cid:2)κ2

∆ˆs1 = atan2(κ1 sin x1 − κ12 sin x2  κ1 cos x1 − κ12 cos x2) 

(12)
(13)
The above equations are the criteria for us to judge whether the disparity information between two
cues is optimally encoded in a neural system.

3 Geometrical Interpretation of Multisensory Information Processing

A beneﬁt of using the von Mises distribution is that it gives us a clear geometrical interpretation of
multisensory information processing. A von Mises distribution M (s − x  κ) can be interpreted as
a vector in a two-dimensional space with its mean x and concentration κ representing respectively
the angle and length of the vector (Fig. 2B-C). This ﬁts well with the circular property of heading
direction. When the posterior of a stimulus is interpreted as a vector  the vector length represents the
conﬁdence of inference. Interestingly  under such a geometrical interpretation  the product of two von
Mises distributions equals summation of their corresponding vectors  and the ratio of two von Mises
distributions equals subtraction of the two vectors. Thus  from Eq. (4)  we see that multisensory
integration is equivalent to vector summation  with each vector representing the posterior of the
stimulus given a single cue  and from Eq. (9)  multisensory segregation is equivalent to vector
subtraction (see Fig. 2D).
Overall  multisensory integration and segregation transform the original two vectors  the posteriors
given each cue  into two new vectors  the posterior given combined cues and the disparity between
the two cues. The original two vectors can be recovered from their linear combinations. Hence 
there is no information loss. The geometrical interpretation also helps us to understand multisensory
information processing intuitively. For instance  if two vectors have a small intersection angle  i.e.  the

difference becomes small. (B) A von Mises distribution in the polar coordinate. (C) A von Mises
distribution M (s − x  κ) can be represented as a vector in a 2D space with its angle given by

The posteriors of s1 given each cue are represented by two vectors (blue). Inverse of a posterior
corresponds to rotating it by 180◦. Multisensory integration corresponds to the summation of two
vectors (green)  and multisensory segregation the subtraction of two vectors (red).

posteriors given each cue tend to support each other  the length of summed vector is long  implying
that the posterior of cue integration has strong conﬁdence; and the length of subtracting vector is short 
implying that the disparity between two cues is small. If the two vectors have a large intersection
angle  the interpretation becomes the opposite.

4 Neural Implementation of Multisensory Information Processing

4.1 The model Structure

We adopt a decentralized architecture to model multisensory information processing in the brain [7 
19]. Compared with the centralized architecture in which a dedicated processor carries out all
computations  the decentralized architecture considers a number of local processors communicating
with each other via reciprocal connections  so that optimal information processing is achieved at
each local processor distributively [7]. This architecture was supported by a number of experimental
ﬁndings  including the involvement of multiple  rather than a single  brain areas in visual-vestibular
integration [1  10]  the existence of intensive reciprocal connections between MTSd and VIP [20  21] 
and the robustness of multisensory integration against the inactivation of a single module [22]. In a
previous work [7]  Zhang et al. studied a decentralized model for multisensory integration at MSTd
and VIP  and demonstrated that optimal integration can be achieved at both areas simultaneously 
agreeing with the experimental data. In their model  MSTd and VIP are congruently connected  i.e. 
neurons in one module are strongly connected to those having the similar preferred heading directions
in the other module. This congruent connection pattern naturally gives rise to congruent neurons.
Since the number of opposite neurons is comparable with that of congruent neurons in MSTd and VIP 
it is plausible that they also have a computational role. It is instructive to compare the probabilistic
models of multisensory integration and segregation  i.e.  Eqs. (4) and (10). They have the same form 
except that in segregation the stimulus value in the posterior given the indirect cue is shifted by π.
Furthermore  since congruent reciprocal connections lead to congruent neurons  we hypothesize that
opposite neurons are due to opposite reciprocal connections  and their computational role is to encode
the disparity information between two cues. The decentralized model for concurrent multisensory
integration and segregation in MSTd and VIP is shown in Fig.3.

(A) The model is composed of two modules  representing MSTd and
VIP respectively. Each module receives the direct cue via feedforward input. In each module  there
are two nets of excitatory neurons  each connected recurrently. Net c (blue) consists of congruent
neurons. Congruent neurons between modules are connected reciprocally in the congruent manner
(blue lines). On the other hand  net o (red) consists of opposite neurons  and opposite neurons between
modules are connected in the opposite manner (brown lines). Moreover  to implement competition
between information integration and segregation  all neurons in a module are connected to a common
inhibitory neuron pool (purple  only shown in module 1). (B) The recurrent  congruent  and opposite

the congruent and opposite cells respectively  and m = 1  2 represents respectively MSTd and VIP.
For simplicity  we assume that the two modules are symmetric  and only present the dynamics of
module 1.

αm controls the reliability of cue m [5]. The exact form of the feedforward input is not crucial  as
long as it has a uni-modal shape.

4.3 Results

We ﬁrst verify that our model reproduces the characteristics of congruent and opposite neurons.
Figs. 4A&B show the tuning curves of a congruent and an opposite neuron with respect to either
visual or vestibular cues  which demonstrate that neurons in our model indeed exhibit the congruent
or opposite direction selectivity similar to Fig. 1.
We then investigate the mean population activities of our model under different cuing conditions.

When only cue x2
is applied to module 2  the congruent neuronal network at module 1 receives a reciprocal input
and generates a bump at x2  whereas the opposite neuronal network receives an offset reciprocal
input and generates a bump at x2 + π (Fig. 4D). For the indirect cue x2  the neural activities it
induces at module 1 is lower than that induced by the direct cue x1 (Fig. 4C). When both cues are
presented  the congruent neuronal network integrates the feedforward and reciprocal inputs  whereas
the opposite neuronal network computes their disparity by integrating the feedforward inputs and the
offset reciprocal inputs shifted by π (Fig. 4E). The two networks compete with each other via divisive
normalization. Fig. 4F shows that when the disparity between cues is small  the activity of congruent
neurons is higher than that of opposite neurons. With the increase of cue disparity  the activity of the
congruent neuronal network decreases  whereas the activity of the opposite neurons increases. These
complementary changes in activities of congruent and opposite neurons provide a clue for other parts
of the brain to evaluate whether the cues are from the same or different objects [24].
Finally  to verify whether Bayes-optimal multisensory information processing is achieved in our
model  we check the validity of Eqs. (7-8) for multisensory integration p(sm|x1  x2) by congruent
neurons in module m  and Eqs. (12-13) for multisensory segregation D(sm|xm; sm|xl) (l (cid:54)= m) by
opposite neurons in module m. Take the veriﬁcation of the congruent neuronal network in module m
as an example. When a pair of cues are simultaneously applied  the actual mean and concentration
of the networks’s estimates (bump position) are measured through population vector [25] (SI Sec.
4.2). To obtain the Bayesian predictions for the network’s estimate under combined cue condition
(details in SI Sec. 4.3)  the mean and concentration of that network’s estimates under either single
cue conditions are also measured  and then are substituted into Eqs. (7-8). Comparisons between
the measured mean and concentration of congruent networks in two modules and the corresponding
theoretical predictions are shown in Fig. 4G&H  indicating an excellent ﬁt  where each dot is the
result under a particular set of parameters. Similarly  comparisons between the measured mean
and concentration of opposite networks and the theoretical predictions (SI Sec. 4.3) are shown in
Fig. 4I&J  indicating opposite neurons indeed implement multisensory segregation.

5 Conclusion and Discussion

Over the past years  multisensory integration has received large attention in modelling studies  but
the equally important issue of multisensory segregation has been rarely explored. The present study
proposes that opposite neurons  which is widely observed at MSTd and VIP  encode the disparity
information between sensory cues. We built a computational model composed of reciprocally
coupled MSTd and VIP  and demonstrated that the characteristics of congruent and opposite cells
naturally emerge from the congruent and opposite connection patterns between modules  respectively.
Using the von Mises distribution  we derived the optimal criteria for integration and segregation
of circular variables and found they have clear geometrical meanings: integration corresponds to
vector summation while segregation corresponds to vector subtraction. We further showed that such a
decentralized system can realize optimal cue integration and segregation at each module distributively.
To our best knowledge  this work is the ﬁrst modelling study unveiling the functional role of opposite
cells. It has a far-reaching implication on multisensory information processing  that is  the brain
can exploit sisters of congruent and opposite neurons to implement cue integration and segregation
concurrently.
For simplicity  only perfectly congruent or perfectly opposite neurons are considered  but in reality 
there are some portions of neurons whose differences of preferred visual and vestibular heading
directions are in between 0◦ and 180◦ (Fig. 1C). We checked that those neurons can arise from adding
noises in the reciprocal connections. As long as the distribution in Fig. 1C is peaked at 0◦ and 180◦ 
the model can implement concurrent integration and segregation. Also  we have only pointed out
that the competition between congruent and opposite neurons provides a clue for the brain to judge
whether the cues are likely to originate from the same or different objects  without exploring how the
brain actually does this. These issues will be investigated in our future work.
