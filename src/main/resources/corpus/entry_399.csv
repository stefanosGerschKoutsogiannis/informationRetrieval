Abstract

This paper proposes an efﬁcient online learning algorithm to track the smoothing
functions of Additive Models. The key idea is to combine the linear representa-
tion of Additive Models with a Recursive Least Squares (RLS) ﬁlter. In order to
quickly track changes in the model and put more weight on recent data  the RLS
ﬁlter uses a forgetting factor which exponentially weights down observations by
the order of their arrival. The tracking behaviour is further enhanced by using an
adaptive forgetting factor which is updated based on the gradient of the a priori
errors. Using results from Lyapunov stability theory  upper bounds for the learn-
ing rate are analyzed. The proposed algorithm is applied to 5 years of electricity
load data provided by the French utility company Electricit´e de France (EDF).
Compared to state-of-the-art methods  it achieves a superior performance in terms
of model tracking and prediction accuracy.

Introduction

Additive Models are a class of nonparametric regression methods which have been the subject of
intensive theoretical research and found widespread applications in practice (see [1]). This con-
siderable attention comes from the ability of Additive Models to represent non-linear associations
between covariates and response variables in an intuitive way  and the availability of efﬁcient train-
ing methods. The fundamental assumption of Additive Models is that the effect of covariates on
the dependent variable follows an additive form. The separate effects are modeled by smoothing
splines  which can be learned using penalized least squares.
A particularly fruitful ﬁeld for the application of Additive Models is the modeling and forecasting
of short term electricity load. There exists a vast body of literature on this subject  covering methods
from statistics (Seasonal ARIMA models [2  3]  Exponential Smoothing [4]  regression models
[5  6  7]) and  more recently  also from machine learning [8  9  10]. Additive Models were applied 
with good results  to the nation-wide load in France [11] and to regional loads in Australia [12].
Besides electricity load  Additive Models have also been applied to natural gas demand [13].
Several methods have been proposed to track time-varying behaviour of the smoothing splines in
Additive Models. Hoover et al. [14] examine estimators based on locally weighted polynomials and
derive some of their asymptotic properties. In a similar vein  Eubank et al. [15] introduce a Bayesian
approach which can handle multiple responses. A componentwise smoothing spline is suggested by
Chiang et al. [16]. Fan and Zhang [17] propose a two-stage algorithm which ﬁrst computes raw

estimates of the smoothing functions at different time points and then smoothes the estimates. A
comprehensive review can be found in [18]. A common feature of all these methods is that they
identify and estimate the time-varying behaviour a posteriori.
Adaptive learning of Additive Models in an online fashion is a relatively new topic. In [19]  an
algorithm based on iterative QR decompositions is proposed  which yields promising results for the
French electricity load but also highlights the need for a forgetting factor to be more reactive  e.g.  to
macroeconomic and meteorological changes  or varying consumer portfolios. Harvey and Koopman
[20] propose an adaptive learning method which is restricted to changing periodic patterns. Adaptive
methods of a similar type have been studied in the ﬁeld of neural networks [21  22].
The contributions of our paper are threefold: First  we introduce a new algorithm which combines
Additive Models with a Recursive Least Squares (RLS) ﬁlter to track time-varying behaviour of the
smoothing splines. Second  in order to enhance the tracking ability  we consider ﬁlters that include a
forgetting factor which can be either ﬁxed  or updapted using a gradient descent approach [23]. The
basic idea is to decrease the forgetting factor (and hence increase the reactivity) in transient phases 
and increasing the forgetting factor (thus decreasing the variability) during stationary regimes. Using
results from Lyapunov stability theory [24]  we provide a theoretical analysis of the learning rate in
the gradient descent approach. Third  we evaluate the proposed methodology on 5 years of electricity
load data provided by the French utility company Electricit´e de France (EDF). The results show that
the adaptive learning algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of model tracking
and prediction accuracy. Moreover  the experiments demonstrate that using an adaptive forgetting
factor stabilizes the algorithm and yields results comparable to those obtained by using the (a priori
unknown) optimal value for a ﬁxed forgetting factor. Note that  in this paper  we do not compare our
proposed algorithm with existing online learning methods from the machine learning literature  such
as tracking of best experts (see [25] for an overview). The reason is that we are speciﬁcally interested
in adaptive versions of Additive Models  which have been shown to be particularly well-suited for
modeling and forecasting electricity load.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the deﬁnition of Additive
Models and provides some background on the spline representation of smoothing functions. In Sec-
tion 3 we present our adaptive learning algorithms which combine Additive Models with a Recursive
Least Squares (RLS) ﬁlter. We discuss different approaches for including forgetting factors and an-
alyze the learning rate for the gradient descent method in the adaptive forgetting factor approach.
A case study with real electricity load data from EDF is presented in Section 4. An outlook on
problems for future research concludes the paper.

2 Additive Models

In this section we review the Additive Models and provide background information on the spline
representation of smoothing functions. Additive Models have the following form:

I(cid:88)

yk =

fi(xk) + k.

i=1

In this formulation  xk is a vector of covariates which can be either categorical or continuous  and
yk is the dependent variable  which is assumed to be continuous. The noise term k is assumed
to be Gaussian  independent and identically distributed with mean zero and ﬁnite variance. The
functions fi are the transfer functions of the model  which can be of the following types: constant
(exactly one transfer function  representing the intercept of the model)  categorical (evaluating to 0
or 1 depending on whether the covariates satisfy certain conditions)  or continuous. The continuous
transfer functions can be either linear functions of covariates (representing simple linear trends)  or
smoothing splines. Typically  smoothing splines depend on only 1-2 of the continuous covariates.
An interesting possibility is to combine smoothing splines with categorical conditions; in the context
of electricity load modeling this allows  e.g.  for having different effects of the time of the day
depending on the day of the week.

Ji(cid:88)

In our experiments  we use 1- and 2-dimensional cubic B-splines  which allows us to write the
smoothing splines in the following form:

fi(xk) = βT

i bi(xk) =

βijbij(xk) 

(1)

j=1

where βij are the spline coefﬁcients and bij are the spline basis functions which depend on 1 or 2
components of xk. Note that the basis functions are deﬁned by a (ﬁxed) sequence of knot points 
while the coefﬁcients are used to ﬁt the spline to the data (see [1] for details). The quantity Ji in
equation (1) is the number of spline coefﬁcients associated with the transfer function fi. Now  let β
denote the stacked vector containing the spline coefﬁcients  and b(xk) the stacked vector containing
the spline basis functions of all the transfer functions. This allows us to write the Additive Models
in the following linear form:

yk = βT b(xk) + k.

(2)

2.1 Learning Additive Models

(cid:98)βK = min

β

The linear representation of Additive Models in (2) is the starting point for efﬁcient learning algo-
rithms. Consider K samples (xk  yk)  k = 1  . . .   K of covariates and dependent variables. Then an
estimate of the model coefﬁcients β can be obtained by solving the following weighted penalized
least squares problem:

(cid:110)
(yK − BKβ)T ΩK (yK − BKβ) + βT SKβ

(3)
Here yK = (y1  y2  . . .   yK)T is the K × 1 vector containing all the dependent variables  BK is the
matrix with the rows b(x1)T   b(x2)T   . . .   b(xK)T containing the evaluated spline basis functions.
The matrix ΩK puts different weights on the samples. In this paper  we consider two scenarios: ΩK
is the identity matrix (putting equal weight on the K regressors)  or a diagonal matrix which puts
exponentially decreasing weights on the samples  according to the order of their arrival (thus giving
rise to the notion of forgetting factors). The different weighting schemes are discussed in more detail
in Section 3. The matrix SK in (3) introduces a penalizing term in order to avoid overﬁtting of the
smoothing splines. In this paper  we use diagonal penalizers not depending on the sample size K:

(cid:111)

.

(4)
where γ > 0. Note that this penalizer shrinks the smoothing splines towards zero functions  and
the strength of this effect is tuned by γ. As a well-known fact (see [1])  provided that the matrix
(BT

KΩKBK + S) is non-singular  the above least squares problem has the closed-form solution

S = diag(γ  γ  . . .   γ) 

(cid:98)βK = (BT

KΩKBK + S)−1BT

KΩKyK.

3 Adaptive learning of smoothing functions

Equation (5) gives rise to an efﬁcient batch learning algorithm for Additive Models. Next  we
propose an adaptive method which allows us to track changes in the smoothing functions in an
online fashion. The basic idea is to combine the linear representation of Additive Models in (2) with
classical Recursive Least Squares (RLS) ﬁlters. To improve the tracking behaviour  we introduce a
forgetting factor which puts more weight on recent samples. See Algorithm 1 for details. As starting

values  we choose(cid:98)β0 equal to an initial estimate of β (e.g.  obtained in previous experiments)  or
(cid:98)βk can be used to compute predictions for new given covariates.

equal to a zero vector if no prior information is available. The initial precision matrix P 0 is set equal
to the inverse of the penalizer S in (4). Anytime while the algorithm is running  the current estimate

Let us discuss the role of the forgetting factor ω in the adaptive learning algorithm. First  note
that Algorithm 1 is equivalent to the solution of the weighted least squares problem in (5) with the
weighting matrix ΩK = diag(ωK−1  ωK−2  . . .   ω2  ω  1) and the penalizer S as deﬁned in (4). If
ω = 1  all samples are weighted equally. For ω < 1  samples are discounted exponentially according
to the order of their arrival. In general  a smaller forgetting factor improves the tracking of temporal
changes in the model coefﬁcients β. This reduction of the bias typically comes at the cost of an
increase of the variance. Therefore  ﬁnding the right balance between the forgetting factor ω and the
strength γ of the penalizer in (4) is crucial for a good performance of the forecasting algorithm.

3.1 Adaptive forgetting factors

In this section we present a modiﬁcation of Algorithm 1 which uses adaptive forgetting factors
in order to improve the stability and the tracking behaviour. The basic idea is to choose a large
forgetting factor during stationary regimes (when the a priori errors are small)  and small forgetting
factors during transient phases (when the a priori error is large). In this paper we adopt the gradient
descent approach in [23] and update the forgetting factor according to the following formula:

ωk = ωk−1 − η

∂ E[(cid:98) 2

k ]
∂ ωk−1

.

Note that ωk is updated in an iterative fashion based on ψk (the gradient of the estimate (cid:98)βk with

k ] with respect to ωk−1 aims at minimizing
the expected value of the a priori errors. The learning rate η > 0 determines the reactivity of the
algorithm: if it is high  then the errors lead to large decreases of the forgetting factor  and vice versa.
The details of the adaptive forgetting factor approach are given in Algorithm 2.

3.2 Stability analysis

In the following  we apply results from Lyapunov stability theory to analyze the effect of the learning
rate η. We show how to derive analytical bounds for η that guarantee stability of the algorithm.

Recall the deﬁnition of the a priori error (cid:98)k = yk− bT
we consider the ideal situation(cid:98)k = 0. We choose the candidate Lyapunov function V ((cid:98)k) =(cid:98) 2
and V (x) → ∞ as x → ∞. Consider the discrete time derivative ∆V ((cid:98)k) = V ((cid:98)k+1) − V ((cid:98)k)
of the candidate Lyapunov function. According to Lyapunov stability theory  if V ((cid:98)k) > 0 and
∆V ((cid:98)k) < 0  then V ((cid:98)k) converges to zero as k tends to inﬁnity.
Let us analyze ∆V ((cid:98)k) more closely. Using the relation(cid:98)k = ∆(cid:98)k+1 +(cid:98)k we arrive at

4 Case study: Forecasting of electricity load

In this section  we apply our adaptive learning algorithms to real electricity load data provided by
the French utility company Electricit´e de France (EDF). Modeling and forecasting electricity load
is a challenging task due to the non-linear effects  e.g.  of the temperature and the time of the day.
Moreover  the electricity load exhibits many non-stationary patterns  e.g.  due to changing macroe-
conomic conditions (leading to an increase/decrease in electricity demand)  or varying customer
portfolios resulting from the liberalization of European electricity markets. The performance on
these highly complex  non-linear and non-stationary learning tasks is a challenging benchmark for
our adaptive algorithms.

4.1 Experimental data

The dependent variables yk in the data provided by EDF represent half-hourly electricity load mea-
surements between February 2  2006 and April 6  2011. The covariates xk include the following
information:

  xTimeOfDay

k

  xTimeOfYear

k

  xTemperature

k

  xCloudCover

k

  xLoadDecrease

k

Let us explain these components in more detail:

• xDayType

is a categorical variable representing the day type: 1 for Sunday  2 for Monday  3

k
for Tuesday-Wednesday-Thursday  4 for Friday  5 for Saturday  and 6 for bank holidays.

xk = (cid:0)xDayType

k

(cid:1).

• xTimeOfDay

• xTimeOfYear

• xTemperature

is the index (in half-hourly time steps) of the current time within the day. Its

k
values range from 0 for 0.00 am to 47 for 11.30 pm.

is the position of the current day within the year (taking values from 0 for January

k
1  to 1 for December 31).

k

and xCloudCover

represent the temperature and the cloud cover (ranging from 0 for a
k
blue sky to 8 for overcast). These meteorological covariates have been provided by M´et´eo
France; the raw data include temperature and cloud cover data recorded every 3 hours from
26 weather stations all over France. We interpolate these measurements to obtain half-
hourly data. A weighted average – the weights reﬂecting the importance of a region in
terms of the national electricity load – is computed to obtain the national temperature and
cloud cover covariates.

contains information about the activation of contracts between EDF and some

k
big customers to reduce the electricity load during peak days.

• xLoadDecrease

6(cid:88)

We partition the data into two sets: a training set from February 2  2006 to August 31  2010  and a
test set from September 1  2010 to April 6  2011.

4.2 Modeling the electricity load

We use the following Additive Model for the electricity load:

yk = βIntercept + f Trend(k) + f LagLoad(yk−48) +

1(xDayType

k

= l)(βDayType

l

+ f TimeOfDay

l

(xk))

+ f CloudCover(xk) + f Temperature/TimeOfDay(xk) + f LagTemperature(xk−48)
+ f TimeOfYear(xk) + xLoadDecrease
Let us explain the model in more detail:

f LoadDecrease(xk) + k.

• The intercept βIntercept models the base load  and f Trend(k) captures non-linear trends  e.g. 

and f TimeOfDay

(xk) capture the day-type speciﬁc effects of the time of the day.

due to the economic crisis and changes in the customer portfolios of EDF.
• f LagLoad(yk−48) takes into account the electricity load of the previous day.
• βDayType
• f CloudCover(xk) and f Temperature/TimeOfDay(xk) represent respectively the effect of the cloud cover
• The term f LagTemperature(xk−48) takes into account the temperature of the previous day  which
is important to capture the thermal inertia of buildings.
• f TimeOfYear(xk) represents yearly cycles  and xLoadDecrease

and the bivariate effect of the temperature and the time of the day.

f LoadDecrease(xk) models the effect of

k

contracts to reduce peak loads depending on the time of the day.

To ﬁt the model we use the R package mgcv (see [26  27]). For more information about the de-
sign of models for electricity data we refer to [19  11]. Figure 1 shows the estimated joint effect
of the temperature and the time of the day  and the estimated yearly cycle. As to be expected 
low (resp. high) temperatures lead to an increase of the electricity load due to electrical heating
(resp. cooling)  whereas temperatures between 10◦ and 20◦ Celsius have almost no effect on the
electricity load. Due to the widespread usage of electrical heating and relatively low usage of air
conditioning in France  the effect of heating is approximately four times higher than the effect of
cooling. The yearly cycle reveals a strong decrease of the electricity load during the summer and
Christmas holidays (around 0.6 and 1 of the time of the year). Note that the scales of the effects
have been normalized because of data conﬁdentiality reasons.
The ﬁtted model achieves a good performance on the training data set with an adjusted R-square of
0.993  a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 1.4%  and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
of 835 MW. All the incorporated effects yield signiﬁcant improvements in terms of the Generalized
Cross Validation (GCV) score  so the model size cannot be reduced. The ﬁtted model consists of
268 spline basis coefﬁcients  which indicates the complexity of modeling electricity load data.

4.3 Adaptive learning and forecasting

We compare the performance of ﬁve different algorithms:

data without updating the model parameters.

• The ofﬂine method (denoted by oﬂ) uses the model learned in R and applies it to the test
• The ﬁxed forgetting factor method (denoted by fff) updates the Additive Model using a
ﬁxed forgetting factor (see Algorithm 1). The value of the ﬁxed forgetting factor and the
strength of the penalizer are determined in the following way: We divide the test set into
two parts of equal length  a calibration set (September 1  2010 - November 15  2010)
and a validation set (November 16  2010 - April 6  2011). We choose the combination of
forgetting factor and penalizer strength which yields the best results on the calibration set
in terms of MAPE and RMSE  and evalute the performance on the validation set.
• The post-ﬁxed forgetting factor method (denoted by post-fff) uses the ﬁxed forgetting fac-
tor and strength of the penalizer which yield the best performance on the validation set. This
“ideal” parameterization gives us an upper bound for the performance of the fff method and
a benchmark for the adaptive forgetting factor approaches.

• The adaptive forgetting factor method (denoted by aff) uses Algorithm 2.
• Finally  we evaluate an adaptive approach that optimizes the values of the forgetting factor
and the penalizer strength on a grid (denoted by affg): For each combination on the grids
(0.995  0.996  ...  0.999) and (1000  2000  ...  10000)  we run ﬁxed forgetting factor algo-
rithms in parallel. At each time point  we choose the combination which so far has given
the best performance in terms of MAPE.

4.4 Results

The performance of all ﬁve algorithms is evaluted on the validation set from November 16  2010 to
April 6  2011. Table 1 shows the results in terms of MAPE and RMSE. As can be seen  the adaptive
forgetting factor method (aff) achieves the best performance. It even outperforms the post-fff method
which uses the (a priori unknown) optimal combination of penalizer strength and ﬁxed forgetting
factor. The improvements over the ofﬂine approach (which doesn’t update the model parameters)
are signiﬁcant both in terms of the MAPE (about 0.2%) and the RMSE (about 100 MW). This
corresponds to an improvement of approximatively 10% in terms of the day-ahead forecasting error.
Figure 2 (left) shows the cumulative sum of the errors of the ﬁve forecasting algorithms. As can be
seen  the ofﬂine approach suffers from a strong positive bias and tends to overestimate the electricity
load over time. In fact  there was a decrease in the electricity demand over the considered time
horizon due to the economic crisis. The adaptive forgetting factor shows a much better tracking

the strength of the penalizer. Values of the forgetting factor close to 1 result in reduced tracking be-
haviour and less improvement over the ofﬂine approach. Choosing too small values for the forgetting
factor can lead to loss of information and instabilities of the algorithm. Increasing the penalizer re-
duces the variability of the smoothing splines  however  it also introduces a bias as the splines are
shrinked towards zero.

5 Conclusions and future work

We have presented an adaptive learning algorithm that updates the smoothing functions of Addi-
tive Models in an online fashion. We have introduced methods to improve the tracking behaviour
based on forgetting factors and analyzed theoretical properties using results from Lyapunov stability
theory. The signiﬁcance of the proposed algorithms was demonstrated in the context of forecasting
electricity load data. Modeling and forecasting electricity load data is particularly challenging due
to the high complexity of the models (the Additive Models in our experiments included 268 spline
basis functions)  the non-linear relation between the covariates and dependent variables  and the
non-stationary dynamics of the models. Experiments on 5 years of data from Electricit´e de France
have shown the superior performance of algorithms using an adaptive forgetting factor. As it turned
out  a crucial point is to ﬁnd the right combination of forgetting factors and the strength of the pe-
nalizer. While forgetting factors tend to reduce the bias of models evolving over time  they typically
increase the variance  an effect which can be compensated by choosing stronger penalizer. Our fu-
ture research will follow two directions: ﬁrst  we plan to consider dynamic penalizers which can
automatically adapt to changes in the model complexity. Second  we will develop methods for in-
corporating prior information on model components  e.g.  by integrating beliefs for the initial values
of the adaptive algorithms.
