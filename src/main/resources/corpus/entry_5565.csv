Abstract

In this paper  we derive theoretical bounds for the long-term inﬂuence of a node
in an Independent Cascade Model (ICM). We relate these bounds to the spectral

spectral radius is lower than 1. More speciﬁcally  we point out that  in general

networks  the sub-critical regime behaves in O(
network  and that this upper bound is met for star-shaped networks. We apply our
results to epidemiology and percolation on arbitrary networks  and derive a bound
for the critical value beyond which a giant connected component arises. Finally 
we show empirically the tightness of our bounds for a large family of networks.

Introduction

The emergence of social graphs of the World Wide Web has had a considerable effect on propaga-
tion of ideas or information. For advertisers  these new diffusion networks have become a favored
vector for viral marketing operations  that consist of advertisements that people are likely to share
by themselves with their social circle  thus creating a propagation dynamics somewhat similar to
the spreading of a virus in epidemiology ([1]). Of particular interest is the problem of inﬂuence
maximization  which consists of selecting the top-k nodes of the network to infect at time t = 0
in order to maximize in expectation the ﬁnal number of infected nodes at the end of the epidemic.
This problem was ﬁrst formulated by Domingues and Richardson in [2] and later expressed in [3]
as an NP-hard discrete optimization problem under the Independent Cascade (IC) framework  a
widely-used probabilistic model for information propagation.
From an algorithmic point of view  inﬂuence maximization has been fairly well studied. Assuming
the transmission probability of all edges are known  Kempe  Kleinberg and Tardos ([3]) derived
a greedy algorithm based on Monte-Carlo simulations that was shown to approximate the optimal
solution up to a factor 1− 1
e   building on classical results of optimization theory. Since then  various
techniques were proposed in order to signiﬁcantly improve the scalability of this algorithm ([4  5  6 
7])  and also to provide an estimate of the transmission probabilities from real data ([8  9]). Recently 
a series of papers ([10  11  12]) introduced continuous-time diffusion networks in which infection
spreads during a time period T at varying rates across the different edges. While these models
provide a more accurate representation of real-world networks for ﬁnite T   they are equivalent to the
IC model when T → ∞. In this paper  will focus on such long-term behavior of the contagion.
From a theoretical point of view  little is known about the inﬂuence maximization problem under the
IC model framework. The most celebrated result established by Newman ([13]) proves the equiva-
lence between bond percolation and the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model in epidemiology
([14]) that can be identiﬁed to a special case of IC model where transmission probability are equal
amongst all infectious edges.
In this paper  we propose new bounds on the inﬂuence of any set of nodes. Moreover  we prove the
existence of an epidemic threshold for a key quantity deﬁned by the spectral radius of a given hazard

matrix. Under this threshold  the inﬂuence of any given set of nodes in a network of size n will be
n)  while the inﬂuence of a randomly chosen set of nodes will be O(1). We provide empirical
O(
evidence that these bounds are sharp for a family of graphs and sets of initial inﬂuencers and can
therefore be used as what is to our knowledge the ﬁrst closed-form formulas for inﬂuence estimation.
We show that these results generalize bounds obtained on the SIR model by Draief  Ganesh and
Massouli´e ([15]) and are closely related to recent results on percolation on ﬁnite inhomogeneous
random graphs ([16]).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
In Sec. 2  we recall the deﬁnition of Information
Cascades Model and introduce useful notations.
In Sec. 3  we derive theoretical bounds for the
inﬂuence. In Sec. 4  we show that our results also apply to the ﬁelds of percolation and epidemiology
and generalize existing results in these ﬁelds. In Sec. 5  we illustrate our results by applying them
on simple networks and retrieving well-known results. In Sec. 6  we perform experiments in order
to show that our bounds are sharp for a family of graphs and sets of initial nodes.

Information Cascades Model

2.1 Inﬂuence in random networks and infection dynamics
Let G = (V E) be a directed network of n nodes and A ⊂ V be a set of n0 nodes that are initially
contagious (e.g. aware of a piece of information  infected by a disease or adopting a product). In
the sequel  we will refer to A as the inﬂuencers. The behavior of the cascade is modeled using a
probabilistic framework. The inﬂuencer nodes spread the contagion through the network by means
of transmission through the edges of the network. More speciﬁcally  each contagious node can infect
its neighbors with a certain probability. The inﬂuence of A  denoted as σ(A)  is the expected number
of nodes reached by the contagion originating from A  i.e.

(cid:88)

v∈V

σ(A) =

P(v is infected by the contagion |A).

(1)

We consider three infection dynamics that we will show in the next section to be equivalent regarding
the total number of infected nodes at the end of the epidemic.

Discrete-Time Information Cascades [DT IC(P)] At time t = 0  only the inﬂuencers are in-
fected. Given a matrix P = (pij)ij ∈ [0  1]n×n  each node i that receives the contagion at time t
may transmit it at time t + 1 along its outgoing edge (i  j) ∈ E with probability pij. Node i cannot
make any attempt to infect its neighbors in subsequent rounds. The process terminates when no
more infections are possible.

Continuous-Time Information Cascades [CT IC(F  T )] At time t = 0  only the inﬂuencers
are infected. Given a matrix F = (fij)ij of non-negative integrable functions  each node i that
receives the contagion at time t may transmit it at time s > t along its outgoing edge (i  j) ∈ E
with stochastic rate of occurrence fij(s − t). The process terminates at a given deterministic time
T > 0. This model is much richer than Discrete-time IC  but we will focus here on its behavior
when T = ∞.

Random Networks [RN (P)] Given a matrix P = (pij)ij ∈ [0  1]n×n  each edge (i  j) ∈ E is
removed independently of the others with probability 1 − pij. A node i ∈ V is said to be infected if
i is linked to at least one element of A in the spanning subgraph G(cid:48) = (V E(cid:48)) where E(cid:48) ⊂ E is the
set of non-removed edges.
For any v ∈ V  we will designate by inﬂuence of v the inﬂuence of the set containing only v 
i.e. σ({v}). We will show in Section 4.2 that  if P is symmetric and G undirected  these three
infection processes are equivalent to bond percolation and the inﬂuence of a node v is also equal
to the expected size of the connected component containing v in G(cid:48). This will make our results
applicable to percolation in arbitrary networks. Following the percolation literature  we will denote
as sub-critical a cascade whose inﬂuence is not proportional to the size of the network n.

2.2 The hazard matrix

In order to linearize the inﬂuence problem and derive upper bounds  we introduce the concept of
hazard matrix  which describes the behavior of the information cascade. As we will see in the
following  in the case of Continuous-time Information Cascades  this matrix gives  for each edge of
the network  the integral of the instantaneous rate of transmission (known as hazard function). The
spectral radius of this matrix will play a key role in the inﬂuence of the cascade.
Deﬁnition. For a given graph G = (V E) and edge transmission probabilities pij  let H be the
n × n matrix  denoted as the hazard matrix  whose coefﬁcients are
if (i  j) ∈ E
otherwise

Hij =

Next lemma shows the equivalence between the three deﬁnitions of the previous section.
Lemma 1. For a given graph G = (V E)  set of inﬂuencers A  and transmission probabili-
ties matrix P  the distribution of the set of infected nodes is equal under the infection dynamics

DT IC(P)  CT IC(F ∞) and RN (P)  provided that for any (i  j) ∈ E (cid:82) ∞

0 fij(t)dt = Hij.

Deﬁnition. For a given set of inﬂuencers A ⊂ V  we will denote as H(A) the hazard matrix except
for zeros along the columns whose indices are in A:

H(A)ij = 1{j /∈A}Hij.

(3)
We recall that for any square matrix M  its spectral radius ρ(M ) is deﬁned by ρ(M ) = maxi(|λi|)
where λ1  ...  λn are the (possibly repeated) eigenvalues of matrix M. We will also use that  when
M is a real square matrix with positive entries  ρ( M +M(cid:62)
Remark. When the pij are small  the hazard matrix is very close to the transmission matrix P.
This implies that  for low pij values  the spectral radius of H will be very close to that of P. More
speciﬁcally  a simple calculation holds

3 Upper bounds for the inﬂuence of a set of nodes
Given A ⊂ V the set of inﬂuencer nodes and |A| = n0 < n  we derive here two upper bounds
for the inﬂuence of A. The ﬁrst bound (Proposition 1) applies to any set of inﬂuencers A such
that |A| = n0. Intuitively  this result correspond to a best-case scenario (or a worst-case scenario 
depending on the viewpoint)  since we can target any set of nodes so as to maximize the resulting
contagion.
Proposition 1. Deﬁne ρc(A) = ρ(
by σ(A) the expected number of nodes reached by the cascade starting from A:

). Then  for any A such that |A| = n0 < n  denoting

In particular  when ρc(A) < 1  σ(A) = O(

n) and the regime is sub-critical.

The second result (Proposition 2) applies in the case where A is drawn from a uniform distribution
over the ensemble of sets of n0 nodes chosen amongst n (denoted as Pn0(V)). This result corre-
sponds to the average-case scenario in a setting where the initial inﬂuencer nodes are not known and
drawn independently of the transmissions over each edge.
Proposition 2. Deﬁne ρc = ρ(H+H(cid:62)
). Assume the set of inﬂuencers A is drawn from a uniform
distribution over Pn0(V). Then  denoting by σuniform the expected number of nodes reached by the
cascade starting from A:

σuniform ≤ n0 + γ2(n − n0)

where γ2 is the unique solution in [0  1] of the following equation:

In particular  when ρc < 1  σuniform = O(1) and the regime is sub-critical.

√
The difference in the sub-critical regime between O(
n) and O(1) for the worst and average case
inﬂuence is an important feature of our results  and is veriﬁed in our experiments (see Sec. 6). Intu-
itively  when the network is inhomogeneous and contains highly central nodes (e.g. scale-free net-
works)  there will be a signiﬁcant difference between speciﬁcally targeting the most central nodes
and random targeting (which will most probably target a peripheral node).

4 Application to epidemiology and percolation

Building on the celebrated equivalences between the ﬁelds of percolation  epidemiology and inﬂu-
ence maximization  we show that our results generalize existing results in these ﬁelds.

4.1 Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model in epidemiology

We show here that Proposition 1 further improves results on the SIR model in epidemiology. This
widely used model was introduced by Kermac and McKendrick ([14]) in order to model the prop-
agation of a disease in a given population. In this setting  nodes represent individuals  that can be
in one of three possible states  susceptible (S)  infected (I) or removed (R). At t = 0  a subset A of
n0 nodes is infected and the epidemic spreads according to the following evolution. Each infected
node transmits the infection along its outgoing edge (i  j) ∈ E at stochastic rate of occurrence β and
is removed from the graph at stochastic rate of occurrence δ. The process ends for a given T > 0.
It is straightforward that  if the removed events are not observed  this infection process is equivalent
to CT IC(F  T ) where for any (i  j) ∈ E fij(t) = β exp(−δt). The hazard matrix H is therefore
equal to β
ij is the adjacency matrix of the underlying network. Note

δ A where A = (cid:0)1{(i j)∈E}(cid:1)

4

that  by Lemma 1  our results can be used in order to model the total number of infected nodes in a
setting where infection and recovery rates of a given node exhibit a non-exponential behavior. For
instance  incubation periods for different individuals generally follow a log-normal distribution [17] 
which indicates that continuous-time IC with a log-normal rate of removal might be well-suited to
model some kind of infections.
It was recently shown by Draief  Ganesh and Massouli´e ([15]) that  in the case of undirected net-
works  and if βρ(A) < δ 

σ(A) ≤
δ ρ(A) < 1  the inﬂuence of set of nodes A is O(

nn0
δ ρ(A)

This result shows  that  when ρ(H) = β
n).
We show in the next lemma that this result is a direct consequence of Corollary 1: the condition
ρc(A) < 1 is weaker than ρ(H) < 1 and  under these conditions  the bound of Corollary 1 is tighter.
Lemma 2. For any symmetric adjacency matrix A  initial set of inﬂuencers A such that |A| = n0 <

Moreover  these new bounds capture with more accuracy the behavior of the inﬂuence in extreme
cases. In the limit β → 0  the difference between the two bounds is signiﬁcant  because Proposition
1 yields σ(A) → n0 whereas (9) only ensures σ(A) ≤ √
nn0. When n = n0  Proposition 1 also
ensures that σ(A) = n0 whereas (9) yields σ(A) ≤
. Secondly  Proposition 1 gives also
bounds in the case βρ(A) ≥ δ. Finally  Proposition 1 applies to more general cases that the classical
homogeneous SIR model  and allows infection and recovery rates to vary across individuals.

4.2 Bond percolation
Given a ﬁnite undirected graph G = (V E)  bond percolation theory describes the behavior of
connected clusters of the spanning subgraph of G obtained by retaining a subset E(cid:48) ⊂ E of edges
of G according to a given distribution.When these removals occur independently along each edge
with same probability 1− p  this process is called homogeneous percolation and is fairly well known
(see e.g [18]). The inhomogeneous case  where the independent edge removal probabilities 1 − pij
vary across the edges  is more intricate and has been the subject of recent studies. In particular 
results on critical probabilities and size of the giant component have been obtained by Bollobas 
Janson and Riordan in [16]. However  these bounds hold for a particular class of asymptotic graphs
(inhomogeneous random graphs) when n → ∞. In the next lemma  we show that our results can be
used in order to obtain bounds that hold in expectation for any ﬁxed graph.
Lemma 3. Let P = (pij)ij ∈ [0  1]n×n be a symmetric matrix. Let G(cid:48) = (V E(cid:48)) be the undirected
subgraph of G such that each edge {i  j} ∈ E is removed independently with probability 1− pij. Let
Gd = (V Ed) be the directed graph such that (i  j) ∈ Ed ⇐⇒ {i  j} ∈ E. Then  for any v ∈ V 
the expected size of the connected component containing v in G(cid:48) is equal to the inﬂuence of v in Gd
under the infection process DT IC(P).
We now derive an upper bound for C1(G(cid:48))  the size of the largest connected component of the
spanning subgraph G(cid:48) = (V E(cid:48)). In the following  we will denote by E[C1(G(cid:48))] the expected value
of this random variable  given P = (pij)ij.
Proposition 3. Let G = (V E) be an undirected network where each edge {i  j} ∈ E has an inde-
pendent probability 1− pij of being removed. The expected size of the largest connected component
of the resulting subgraph G(cid:48) is upper bounded by:

E[C1(G(cid:48))] ≤ n

√

γ3 

where γ3 is the unique solution in [0  1] of the following equation:

Moreover  the resulting network has a probability of being connected upper bounded by:

P(G(cid:48) is connected) ≤ γ3.

(13)
In the case ρ(H) < 1  we can further simplify our bounds in the same way than for Propositions 1
and 2.

Corollary 3. In the case ρ(H) < 1  E[C1(G(cid:48))] ≤(cid:113) n

1−ρ(H) .

Whereas our results hold for any n ∈ N  classical results in percolation theory study the asymptotic
behavior of sequences of graphs when n → ∞. In order to further compare our results  we therefore
consider sequences of spanning subgraphs (G(cid:48)
n)n ∈N  obtained by removing each edge of graphs
of n nodes (Gn)n ∈N with probability 1 − pn
ij. A previous result ([16]  Corollary 3.2 of section
5) states that  for particular sequences known as inhomogeneous random graphs and under a given
sub-criticality condition  C1(G(cid:48)
n) = o(n) asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s.)  i.e with probability
going to 1 as n → ∞. Using Proposition 3  we get for our part the following result:
Corollary 4. Assume the sequence

(cid:16)Hn =(cid:0)− ln(1 − pn

(cid:17)

n ∈N is such that

Then  for any  > 0  we have asymptotically almost surely when n → ∞

(14)

(15)

This result is to our knowledge the ﬁrst to bound the expected size of the largest connected compo-
nent in general arbitrary networks.

5 Application to particular networks

In order to illustrate our theoretical results  we now apply our bounds to three speciﬁc networks and
compare them to existing results  showing that our bounds are always of the same order than these
speciﬁc results. We consider three particular networks: 1) star-shaped networks  2) Erd¨os-R´enyi
networks and 3) random graphs with an expected degree distribution. In order to simplify these
problems and exploit existing theorems  we will consider in this section that pij = p is ﬁxed for
each edge {i  j} ∈ E. Infection dynamics thus only depend on p  the set of inﬂuencers A  and the
structure of the underlying network.

(cid:18)(cid:18)

√

5.1 Star-shaped networks
For a star shaped network centered around a given node v1  and A = {v1}  the exact inﬂuence is
computable and writes σ({v1}) = 1 + p(n − 1). As H(A)ij = − ln(1 − p)1{i=1 j(cid:54)=1}  the spectral
radius is given by

(cid:18)H(A) + H(A)(cid:62)

(cid:19)

(16)
Therefore  Proposition 1 states that σ({v1}) ≤ 1 + (n − 1)γ1 where γ1 is the solution of equation

It is worth mentionning that  when p = 1√

inﬂuence does not present a critical behavior and is always linear with respect to the total number of
nodes n.

5.2 Erd¨os-R´enyi networks
For Erd¨os-R´enyi networks G(n  p) (i.e. an undirected network with n nodes where each couple of
nodes (i  j) ∈ V 2 belongs to E independently of the others with probability p)  the exact inﬂuence

6

of a set of nodes is not known. However  percolation theory characterizes the limit behavior of the
giant connected component when n → ∞. In the simplest case of Erd¨os-R´enyi networks G(n  c
n )
the following result holds:
Lemma 4. (taken from [16]) For a given sequence of Erd¨os-R´enyi networks G(n  c

n )  we have:

As previously stated  our results hold for any given graph  and not only asymptotically. However 
we get an asymptotic behavior consistent with the aforementioned result. Indeed  using notations of
section 4.2  Hn

noting that γ3 = (1 + o(1))β  we get that  for any  > 0:

5.3 Random graphs with given expected degree distribution

In this section  we apply our bounds to random graphs whose expected degree distribution is ﬁxed
(see e.g [19]  section 13.2.2). More speciﬁcally  let w = (wi)i∈{1 ... n} be the expected degree of
each node of the network. For a ﬁxed w  let G(w) be a random graph whose edges are selected
independently and randomly with probability

For these graphs  results on the volume of connected components (i.e the expected sum of degrees
of the nodes in these components) were derived in [20] but our work gives to our knowledge the ﬁrst
result on the size of the giant component. Note that Erd¨os-R´enyi G(n  p) networks are a special case
of (18) where wi = np for any i ∈ V.
In order to further compare our results  we note that these graphs are also very similar to the widely
used conﬁguration model where node degrees are ﬁxed to a sequence w  the main difference being
that the occupation probabilities pij are in this case not independent anymore. For conﬁguration

6 Experimental results

In this section  we show that the bounds given in Sec. 3 are tight (i.e. very close to empirical results in
particular graphs)  and are good approximations of the inﬂuence on a large set of random networks.
Fig. 1a compares experimental simulations of the inﬂuence to the bound derived in proposition 1.
The considered networks have n = 1000 nodes and are of 6 types (see e.g [19] for further details on
these different networks): 1) Erd¨os-R´enyi networks  2) Preferential attachment networks  3) Small-
world networks  4) Geometric random networks ([23])  5) 2D regular grids and 6) totally connected
networks with ﬁxed weight b ∈ [0  1] except for the ingoing and outgoing edges of the inﬂuencer
node A = {v1} having weight a ∈ [0  1]. Except for totally connected networks  edge probabilities
are set to the same value p for each edge (this parameter was used to tune the spectral radius ρc(A)).
All points of the plots are averages over 100 simulations. The results show that the bound in propo-
sition 1 is tight (see totally connected networks in Fig. 1a) and close to the real inﬂuence for a large

7

class of random networks. In particular  the tightness of the bound around ρc(A) = 1 validates the
behavior in
n of the worst-case inﬂuence in the sub-critical regime. Similarly  Fig. 1b compares

experimental simulations of the inﬂuence to the bound derived in proposition 2 in the case of random
initial inﬂuencers. While this bound is not as tight as the previous one  the behavior of the bound
agrees with experimental simulations  and proves a relatively good approximation of the inﬂuence
under a random set of initial inﬂuencers. It is worth mentioning that the bound is tight for the sub-
critical regime and shows that corollary 2 is a good approximation of σuniform when ρc < 1. In
order to verify the criticality of ρc(A) = 1  we compared the behavior of σ(A) w.r.t the size of the
network n. When ρc(A) < 1 (see Fig. 2a in which ρc(A) = 0.5)  σ(A) = O(
n)  and the bound
is tight. On the contrary  when ρc(A) > 1 (see Fig. 2b in which ρc(A) = 1.5)  σ(A) = O(n)  and
σ(A) is linear w.r.t. n for most random networks.

(a) Sub-critical regime: ρc(A) = 0.5

(b) Super-critical regime: ρc(A) = 1.5

solid line is the upper bound in proposition 1. Note the square-root versus linear behavior.

7 Conclusion

In this paper  we derived the ﬁrst upper bounds for the inﬂuence of a given set of nodes in any
ﬁnite graph under the Independent Cascade Model (ICM) framework  and relate them to the spectral
radius of a given hazard matrix. We show that these bounds can also be used to generalize previous
results in the ﬁelds of epidemiology and percolation. Finally  we provide empirical evidence that
these bounds are close to the best possible for general graphs.
