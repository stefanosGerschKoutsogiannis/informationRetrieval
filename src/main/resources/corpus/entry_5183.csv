Abstract

Many complex systems  ranging from neural cell assemblies to insect societies 
involve and rely on some division of labor. How to enforce such a division in a
decentralized and distributed way  is tackled in this paper  using a spiking neuron
network architecture. Speciﬁcally  a spatio-temporal model called SpikeAnts is
shown to enforce the emergence of synchronized activities in an ant colony. Each
ant is modelled from two spiking neurons; the ant colony is a sparsely connected
spiking neuron network. Each ant makes its decision (among foraging  sleeping
and self-grooming) from the competition between its two neurons  after the signals
received from its neighbor ants. Interestingly  three types of temporal patterns
emerge in the ant colony: asynchronous  synchronous  and synchronous periodic
foraging activities − similar to the actual behavior of some living ant colonies.
A phase diagram of the emergent activity patterns with respect to two control
parameters  respectively accounting for ant sociability and receptivity  is presented
and discussed.

Introduction

The emergence of organization is at the core of many complex systems  from neural cell assemblies
to living insect societies. For instance  the emergence of synchronized rhythmical activity has been
observed in many social insect colonies [2  4  5  7]  where synchronized patterns of activity may
indeed contribute to the collective efﬁciency in various ways. But how do ants proceed to tem-
porally synchronize their activity? As suggested by Cole [4]  the synchronization of activity is a
consequence of temporal coupling between individuals. It thus comes naturally to investigate how
spiking neuron networks (SNNs)  also based on temporal dynamics  enable to model the emergence
of collective phenomena  speciﬁcally synchronized activities  in complex systems. The reader’s
familiarity with SNNs  inspired from the mechanisms of information processing in the brain  is
assumed in the following  referring to [18] for a comprehensive presentation.

1.1 Related work

In computational neuroscience  SNNs are well known for generating a rich variety of dynamical
patterns of activity  e.g. synchrony of cell assemblies [9]  complete synchrony [17]  transient syn-
chrony [10]  order-chaos phase transition [20] or polychronization [11]. For instance  a mesoscopic
model [3] explains the emergence of a rhythmic oscillation at the network level  resulting from the
competition of excitatory and inhibitory connections between neurons. In computer science  the
ﬁeld of reservoir computing (RC) [13] focuses on analyzing and exploiting the echos generated by
external inputs in the dynamics of sparse random networks. The proposed SpikeAnts model features
one distinctive characteristics compared to the state of the art in RC and SNNs: its only aim is to

1

model an emergent property in a complex closed system; it does neither receive any external inputs
nor involve any learning rule. To our best knowledge  current models of emergence are mostly based
on statistical physics  involving differential equations and mean ﬁeld approaches [19]  or mathemat-
ics and computer science  using random Markov ﬁelds  cellular automata or multi-agent systems.

1.2 Target of the SpikeAnts model

The SpikeAnts model implements a distributed decision making process in a population of agents 
say an ant colony. The phenomenon to analyze is the division of labor. The model relies on the
spatio-temporal interactions of spiking neurons  where each ant agent is accounted for by two neu-
rons.
A simpliﬁed scheme is proposed  inspired from [2] and [16]: Each agent may be in one out of
four states  Observing  Foraging  Sleeping or self-Grooming (Fig. 1). The interactions take place
during the observation round. Each agent a observes its environment and if it perceives none or too
few working agents  a goes foraging for a given time and eventually goes to sleep. Otherwise  if
a perceives “sufﬁciently many” agents engaged in foraging  it goes back to the nest for less vital
tasks (the grooming state) before returning to observation after a while. Each state lasts for a ﬁxed
duration (resp. tO  tF   tS and tG)  with an exception for the observation state. The observation
period is only subject to an upper bound tO. If the agent sees sufﬁciently many other foraging ants
before the end of the observation period  it can switch at once to the self-grooming state.

sage. (Right) An example of agent schedule.

The agent decisions only depend on the information exchanged between them  through agent neu-
rons sending spikes to (respectively  receiving spikes from) other agents in the population. It must
be emphasized that the proposed decision process does not assume the agent ability to “count” (here
the number of its foraging neighbors). In the meanwhile  this process is deterministic  contrasting
with the threshold-based probabilistic models used in [1  2  7].

2 The SpikeAnts spiking neuron network

This section describes the structure of the SpikeAnts model. Each ant agent is modelled by two
spiking neurons. Any two agents (i  j) are connected with an average density ρ (0 (cid:54) ρ (cid:54) 1). The
ant colony thus deﬁnes a sparsely connected network of spiking neurons  referred to as SNN.

2.1 Spiking neuron models

An agent is modelled by two coupled spiking neurons  respectively a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF)
neuron [6  14] and a Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron [8  15]. These models of neuron are
biologically plausible and they have been thoroughly studied. We shall show that their coupling
achieves a frugal control of the agent behavior.
A LIF neuron ﬁres a spike if its potential Vp exceeds a threshold ϑ. Upon ﬁring a spike  Vp is reset

to Vreset. Formally: (cid:26) dVp

2.2 The ant agent model

Each SpikeAnts agent mimics an ant. Its behavior is controlled after the competition between two
coupled spiking neurons  an active one (QIF  Eq. (3)) and a passive one (LIF  Eq. (1)). The agent
additionally involves an internal unit providing the Iclock signal.
During the observation round  the ant makes its decision (whether it goes foraging) based on the
competition between its active and passive neurons (Fig. 2). Both neurons are aware of the forag-
ing neighbor ants. The signal emitted by these neighbors is an excitatory signal (respectively an
inhibitory signal) for the passive (resp. active) neuron: Iinh(t) = −Iexc(t). The active neuron
additionally receives the excitatory signal Iclock(t) of the internal clock unit.
In the case where the ant agent does not see too many foraging ants  the internal excitatory signal
Iclock(t) dominates the inhibitory signal Iinh(t)  the active neuron ﬁres ﬁrst and drives the ant to

dashed line indicates the threshold ϑ. The ﬁrst observation state starts at 20ms: the active neuron
ﬁres before the passive one  the agent thus goes foraging and the active neuron continues sending
spikes during the whole foraging period (signalling its foraging behavior to other agents). After a
sleep period (from circa 50 to 70ms)  starts a second observation round. This time the passive neuron
ﬁres before the active one. The agent thus goes self-grooming  and switches to the observation state
thereafter. During the last observation round  the active neuron wins again against the passive one 
and the agent goes foraging.

foraging (ﬁrst and last episode in Fig. 2). When foraging  the active neuron enters in a bursting
phase and periodically sends a spike to the ant neighbors. Note that these spikes are only meaningful
for the ants in observation state. After a foraging period (duration tF )  the ant goes to sleep (duration
tS). The sleeping state is triggered by a delayed connection between the internal unit and the active
neuron.
Quite the contrary  if the ant sees many other foraging ants  the excitatory signal Iexc(t) drives the
passive neuron to ﬁre before the active one (second episode in Fig. 2)  and the ant accordingly
sets in a self-grooming state (duration tG). The decision making of the ant agent thus relies on the
competition between its active and passive neurons. In particular  the number of spikes needed for
an ant to go foraging or self-grooming depends on the temporal dynamics of the system; it varies
from one observation episode to another. After some rest (self-grooming or sleeping states  with
respective durations tG and tS  tG< tS)  the ant returns to the observation state.
As above-mentioned  incoming spikes are only relevant to the active and passive neurons of an
observing ant. During the foraging and resting states  presynaptic spikes have no inﬂuence  which
can be thought of as an intrinsic plasticity mechanism [21] driven by the internal unit. The internal
unit can indeed be seen as the ant biological clock. In a further model  it will be replaced by a neural
group interacting with active and passive neurons through intrinsic plasticity  e.g. using a transient
increase of λ for LIF and QIF neurons.

2.3 Model parameters

Overall  the SpikeAnts model is controlled by three types of parameters  respectively related to
spiking neuron models  to ant agents (state durations) and to the whole population (size and connec-
tivity of the SNN). The default parameter values used in the simulations are displayed in Table 1.
The values of state durations are such that their ratio are not integers  in order to avoid spurious
synchronizations. Note that state duration timescale is not signiﬁcant at the ant colony level.

3 Experiments
This section reports on the experimental study of the SpikeAnts model  ﬁrst describing the exper-
imental setting and the goals of experiments. The population behavior is measured after a global
indicator  and the sensitivity thereof w.r.t. the SpikeAnts parameters is studied. Two compound con-
trol parameters  summarizing the model parameters and governing the emergent synchronization of
the system are proposed. A consistent phase diagram depicting the global synchronization in the
plane deﬁned from both control parameters is displayed and discussed.

Goals of experiments A ﬁrst goal of experiments is to measure the global activity of the popula-
tion  denoted F and deﬁned as the overall time spent foraging:

where nF (t) is the number of foraging agents at time t. The study focuses on the sensitivity of F
w.r.t. the model parameters.
The second and most important goal of experiments is to study the temporal structure of the pop-
ulation activity. A synchronization indicator will be proposed and its sensitivity w.r.t.
the model
parameters will be examined.

Experimental settings Each run starts with all ants initially sleeping. Each ant wakes up after
some time uniformly drawn in ]0  2tS ]. Spiking neurons are simulated using a discrete time scheme:
numerical simulations of the spiking neuron network are based on a clock-driven simulator  us-
ing Runge-Kutta method for the approximation of differential equations  with a small time step of
0.1ms to enforce numerical stability. Each run lasts for 100 000 time steps. All reported results are
averaged over 10 independent runs.

3.1 Sensitivity analysis of the foraging effort
This section ﬁrst examines how the overall foraging effort F depends on the size M of the popu-
lation  the connection rate ρ and two neural parameters  the active neuron reset potential V a
reset and
the synaptic weight w. The average ¯F is reported with its standard deviation in Fig. 3.

The overall foraging effort F was expected to linearly increase with the population size M. While
it indeed increases with M  it displays a breaking down around M=600 (Fig. 3  top left); this
unexpected change will be explained in section 3.2  and related to the increased variability of the
population synchronization. F was expected to exponentially decrease with the connectivity ρ  and
it does so (Fig. 3  top right): the more neighbors  the more likely an ant will see other foraging ants 
and will thus avoid go foraging itself. Along the same line  F was expected to decrease with the
reset potential V a
reset to ϑ  the more spikes a foraging ant will sent  exciting other
ants’ passive neuron and thereby sending these ants to rest (Fig. 3  bottom left; the value of ϑ is 1 
and F indeed goes to 0 as V a
The most surprising result regards the inﬂuence of the synaptic weight w (Fig. 3  bottom right). It
was expected that high w values would favor the triggering of passive neurons  and thus adversely
affect the foraging effort. High w values however mostly result in a high variance of F. The in-
terpretation proposed for this fact goes as follows. For low w values  an ant behaves as a “good
statistician”  meaning that its decision is based on observing many other foraging agents. Accord-
ingly  the foraging/resting ratio is very stable along time and across runs. As w increases however 
it makes it possible for an ant to take decisions based on few cues and the behavioral variability
increases. More precisely  the F variance is low for small w values (an ant makes its decision based
on about 80 spikes for w = 0.01). The variance dramatically increases in a narrow region around
w = 0.15; an ant makes its decision based on circa 6 spikes and small variations in the received
spike trains might thus lead to different decisions  explaining the high variance of F. For higher w

reset goes to 1).

values however  the F variance decreases again. A close look at the experimental results reveals the
existence of different temporal regimes with abrupt transitions among these  explaining the breaking
down around M = 600 ants and the abrupt increase and decrease of F variance.

tivity (number of foraging ants versus time for t = 1 . . . 2  000). (Bottom row) Temporal correlation
of the activity for the above three patterns  for t = 1 . . . 100  000.

The emergence of three synchronization patterns appears in the experimental results. The ﬁrst one 
referred to as asynchronous (Fig. 4  left)  depicts a situation where each ant (almost) independently
makes its own decisions. The second one  referred to as synchronous (Fig. 4  middle) displays
some coordination among the ants; speciﬁcally  the number of foraging ants is piecewise constant 
though varying from a time interval to another. The third pattern  referred to as periodic synchronous
(Fig. 4  right) involves two stable subpopulations which forage alternatively; the population enters a
bi-phase mode  as actually observed in some ants colonies [4  5].
The difference between the three patterns of activity is most visible from the phase diagram plotting
nF (t + 1) vs nF (t) (Fig. 4  bottom row; transient states are removed in the synchronized periodic
and aperiodic regime for the sake of clarity). The orbit of the synchronous aperiodic activity indi-
cates the presence of at least one attractor whereas the synchronous periodic activity displays a ﬂip
bifurcation.
The ergodicity of the SpikeAnts system is ﬁrst analyzed based on the Lyapunov exponents  after the
computation algorithms proposed in [22]. On asynchronous patterns  the mean value of the 5 000
Lyapunov exponents found with an 8 dimension analysis is −0.01± 0.1. For synchronous aperiodic
patterns  the mean value of the 3 500 Lyapunov exponents found with a 6 dimension analysis is
also −0.01± 0.1 (after discarding the transient states). Whereas the asynchronous and synchronous
aperiodic activities lie at the edge of chaos  the periodic synchronous regime only displays large
negative Lyapunov exponents  indicating a very stable behavior.
An entropy-based indicator is proposed to analyze the emergent synchronization of the SpikeAnts
system. Let I denote the set of values nF (t) (after pruning all transient time steps such that nF (t) (cid:54)=
nF (t + 1) and nF (t) (cid:54)= nF (t − 1)); the foraging histogram is deﬁned by associating to each value
k in I  the number nk of time steps such that nF (t) = k. The synchronization of the population is

The entropy of the asynchronous regime is zero  since all states are transient. The synchronous
periodic regime  where two subpopulations alternatively forage  gets a low entropy (< log 2). Fi-
nally  the synchronous aperiodic regime which involves a few dozens of subpopulations  gets a high
entropy value. The transition from one regime to another one is clearly related to the model pa-
rameters. The goal thus becomes to identify the inﬂuential factors  best explaining the population
behavior.
M and referred to as sociability  controls the amount of
A ﬁrst such inﬂuential factor  deﬁned as ρ
interactions between the ants. A high sociability enables the ants to base their foraging decision on
reliable estimates of the current foraging activity  thus entailing a low variance of the global foraging
effort.
A second inﬂuential factor  referred to as receptivity  is the ratio between the weight w of the input
signal and the subthreshold range (depending on the resting potential Vrest and the spike ﬁring
threshold ϑ). This ratio
w|ϑ−Vrest| indicates the amplitude of the depolarization induced by the input
spike compared to the difference between rest and threshold. A high receptivity thus enables the ant
to postpone its foraging decision based on few cues (i.e. visible foraging ants)  thereby entailing a
high variance of the global foraging effort.
The sociability and receptivity factors  referred to as control parameters  support a clear picture of
the asynchronous  synchronous aperiodic and periodic synchronous patterns. The entropy (Fig. 5 
left) and its variance (Fig. 5  right) are displayed in the 2D plane deﬁned from the sociability and
receptivity of the SpikeAnts system  deﬁning the phase diagram of the SpikeAnts system.
For a low sociability and a high receptivity (region A in Fig. 5)  few interactions among ants take
place and each ant makes its decisions based on few cues. In this region  the population is a col-
lection of quasi independent individuals  and few ants (60 on average on Fig. 4) are foraging at any
given time step.
For a higher sociability and a low receptivity (region B in Fig. 5)  ants see more of their peers and
they base their decisions on reliable estimates of the foraging activity. A synchronization of the ant
activities emerges  in the sense that many agents make their foraging decisions at the same time.
Still  the synchronization remains aperiodic  i.e. the number of foraging ants varies from 50 to 240
(Fig. 4).
For a high sociability and a high receptivity (region C in Fig. 5)  ants see many of their peers and they
make their decisions based on few cues. In this case a periodic synchronized regime is observed 
where two subpopulations alternatively go foraging (the ﬁrst one involves ∼ 950 ants in Fig. 4).

Figure 6: A representative simulation: the global behavior switches from a synchronous aperiodic
regime to an asynchronous one before stabilizing in a periodic synchronous regime.

Complementary experiments show abrupt transitions between the different regimes in the border-
line regions. Speciﬁcally  an asynchronous aperiodic regime (region B) is prone to evolve into an
asynchronous (region A) or periodic synchronous (region C) regimes (Figure 6). Quite the contrary 
the periodic synchronous regime is stable  i.e. the population does not get back to any other regime
after the periodic synchronous regime is installed. The aperiodic synchronous regime  though less
stable than the periodic one  is far more stable than the asynchronous one.

4 Discussion

The main contribution of this paper is a local and parsimonious model  accounting for individual
decision making  which reproduces the emergence of synchronized activity in a complex system in
a realistic way: the three different regimes obtained in simulation are comparable to the different
patterns of activity observed in social insect colonies [7  5  4]. The synchronization patterns that
emerge at the macroscopic scale can be fully controlled by several model parameters ruling the so-
ciability of ants (whether an ant may observe many other ants) and their receptivity (whether an ant
makes its foraging decision based on a few cues). The synchronization patterns are endogenous 
with no external inﬂuence from the environment. Additionally  they do not rely on individual syn-
chronizations  as each agent has a speciﬁc behavior  different from its neighbor and varying during
simulation time.
To our best knowledge  the SpikeAnts model is the ﬁrst one accounting for a population behavior
and based on spiking neurons. SpikeAnts captures both spatial and temporal features of the complex
system in a deterministic way (as opposed to stochastic models). It does not require any external
constraints or data. Most importantly  it does not require the agent to feature sophisticated skills
(e.g. “counting” its foraging neighbors). It is worth noting that SpikeAnts does not involve the
resolution of differential equations: While spiking neurons are modelled in continuous time  their
behavior is computed through ﬁnite differences  parameterized from the user-speciﬁed time step. In
summary  SpikeAnts demonstrates that SNNs can be used to model a simple self-organizing system.
It hopefully opens new perspectives for modelling emergent phenomena in complex systems.
A ﬁrst perspective for further research is to investigate the temporal dynamics of spike trains using
standard approaches from neuroscience. The underlying question is whether the population syn-
chronization can be facilitated  e.g. in the transient regime  by making spiking neurons sensitive to
the synchrony of spike trains. The role of inhibition and the role of the excitation/inhibition balance
in the emergence of synchronized patterns will be studied. In particular  the impact on the phase
diagram of individual parameter variations will be analyzed.
A second perspective is to endow SpikeAnts with some learning skills  e.g. adapting the connections
weights w with a local unsupervised learning rule (e.g. Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity)  in order
to optimize the collective efﬁciency of the population. Along the same line  the ability of SpikeAnts
to cope with external perturbations (e.g. affecting the number of foraging ants) will be investigated.
