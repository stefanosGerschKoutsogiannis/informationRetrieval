Abstract

Learning the dependency structure between spatially distributed observations of
a spatio-temporal process is an important problem in many ﬁelds such as geol-
ogy  geophysics  atmospheric sciences  oceanography  etc. . However  estimation
of such systems is complicated by the fact that they exhibit dynamics at multiple
scales of space and time arising due to a combination of diffusion and convec-
tion/advection [17]. As we show  time-series graphical models based on vector
auto-regressive processes[18] are inefﬁcient in capturing such multi-scale struc-
ture.
In this paper  we present a hierarchical graphical model with physically
derived priors that better represents the multi-scale character of these dynamical
systems. We also propose algorithms to efﬁciently estimate the interaction struc-
ture from data. We demonstrate results on a general class of problems arising in
exploration geophysics by discovering graphical structure that is physically mean-
ingful and provide evidence of its advantages over alternative approaches.

Introduction

Consider the problem of determining the connectivity structure of subsurface aquifers in a large
ground-water system from time-series measurements of the concentration of tracers injected and
measured at multiple spatial locations. This problem has the following features: (i) pressure gra-
dients driving ground-water ﬂow have unmeasured disturbances and changes; (ii) the data contains
only concentration of the tracer  not ﬂow direction or velocity; (iii) there are regions of high perme-
ability where ground water ﬂows at (relatively) high speeds and tracer concentration is conserved
and transported over large distances (iv) there are regions of low permeability where ground water
diffuses slowly into the bed-rock and the tracer is dispersed over small spatial scales and longer
time-scales.

Reconstructing the underlying network structure from spatio-temporal data occurring at multiple
spatial and temporal scales arises in a large number of ﬁelds. An especially important set of ap-
plications arise in exploration geophysics  hydrology  petroleum engineering and mining where the
aim is to determine the connectivity of a particular geological structure from sparsely distributed
time-series readings [16]. Examples include exploration of ground-water systems and petroleum
reservoirs from tracer concentrations at key locations  or use of electrical  induced-polarization and
electro-magnetic surveys to determine networks of ore deposits  groundwater  petroleum  pollutants
and other buried structures [24]. Other examples of multi-scale spatio-temporal phenomena with
the network structure include: ﬂow of information through neural/brain networks [15]  trafﬁc ﬂow
through trafﬁc networks[3]; spread of memes through social networks [23]; diffusion of salinity 
temperature  pressure and pollutants in atmospheric sciences and oceanography [9]; transmission
networks for genes  populations and diseases in ecology and epidemiology; spread of tracers and
drugs through biological networks [17] etc. .

(i) the physics are linear in the ob-
These systems typically exhibit the following features:
served / state variables (e.g. pressure  temperature  concentration  current) but non-linear in the
unknown parameter that determines interactions (e.g. permeability  permittivity  conductance); (ii)
there may be unobserved / unknown disturbances to the system; (iv) (Multi-scale structure) there
are interactions occurring over large spatial scales versus those primarily in local neighborhoods.
Moreover  the large-scale and small-scale processes exhibit characteristic time-scales determined by
the balance of convection velocity and diffusivity of the system. A physics-based approach to esti-
mating the structure of such systems from observed data is by inverting the governing equations [1].
However  in most cases inversion is extremely ill-posed [21] due to non-linearity in model parame-
ters and sparsity of data with respect to the size of the parameter space  necessitating strong priors
on the solution which are rarely available. In contrast  there is a large body of literature on structure
learning for time-series using data-driven methods  primarily developed for econometric and neuro-
scientiﬁc data1. The most common approach is to learn vector auto-regressive (VAR) models  either
directly in the time domain[10] or in the frequency domain[4]. These implicitly assume that all
dynamics and interactions occur at similar time-scales and are acquired at the same frequency [14] 
although VAR models for data at different sampling rates have also been proposed [2]. These mod-
els  however  do not address the problem of interactions occurring at multiple scales of space and
time  and as we show  can be very inefﬁcient for such systems. Multi-scale graphical models have
been constructed as pyramids of latent variables  where higher levels aggregate interactions at pro-
gressively larger scales [25]. These techniques are designed for regular grids such as images  and
are not directly applicable to unstructured grids  where spatial distance is not necessarily related to
the dependence between variables. Also  they construct O(log N ) deep trees thereby requiring an
extremely large (O(N )) latent variable space.
In this paper  we propose a new approach to learning the graphical structure of a multi-scale spatio-
temporal system using a hierarchy of VAR models with one VAR system representing the large-
scale (global) system and one VAR-X model for the (small-scale) local interactions. The main
contribution of this paper is to model the global system as a ﬂow network in which the observed
variable both convects and diffuses between sites. Convection-diffusion (C–D) processes naturally
exhibit multi-scale dynamics [8] and although at small spatial scales their dynamics are varied and
transient  at larger spatial scales these processes are smooth  stable and easy to approximate with
coarse models [13]. Based on this property  we derive a regularization that replicates the large-scale
dynamics of C–D processes. The hierarchial model along with this physically derived prior learns
graphical structures that are not only extremely sparse and rich in their description of the data  but
also physically meaningful. The multi-scale model both reduces the number of edges in the graph by
clustering nodes and also has smaller order than an equivalent VAR model. Next in Section 3  model
relaxations to simplify estimation along with efﬁcient algorithms are developed. In Section 4  we
present an application to learning the connectivity structure for a class of problems dealing with ﬂow
through a medium under a potential/pressure ﬁeld and provide theoretical and empirical evidence of
its advantages over alternative approaches.
One similar approach is that of clustering variables while learning the VAR structure [12] using
sampling-based inference. This method does not  however  model dynamical interactions between
the clusters themselves. Alternative techniques such as independent process analysis [20] and AR-
PCA [7] have also been proposed where auto-regressive models are applied to latent variables ob-
tained by ICA or PCA of the original variables. Again  because these are AR not VAR models 
the interactions between the latent variables are not captured  and moreover  they do not model the
dynamics of the original space. In contrast to these methods  the main aspects of our paper are a
hierarchy of dynamical models where each level explicitly corresponds to a spatio-temporal scale
along with efﬁcient algorithms to estimate their parameters. Moreover  as we show in Section 4 
the prior derived from the physics of C–D processes is critical to estimating meaningful multi-scale
graphical structures.

Let y ∈ RN×T   where y[t] = {y1[t] . . . yN [t]};
t = 1 . . . T   be the time-series data observed at
N sites over T time-points. To capture the multi-scale structure of interactions at local and global
scales  we introduce the K–dimensional (K (cid:28) N) latent process x[t] = {x1[t] . . . xK [t]}; t = 1 . . . T
to represent K global components that interact with each other. Each observed process yi is then a
summation of local interactions along with a global interaction. Speciﬁcally:
p=1 A[p]x[t − p] + u[t] 

Global–process:

x[t] =(cid:80)P
y[t] =(cid:80)Q

r=1 D[r]y[t − r] +(cid:80)S

(VARMA) process y[t] = (cid:80)R

Here Zi k  i = 1 . . . N  k = 1 . . . K are binary variables indicating if site yi belongs to global com-
ponent xk. The N × N matrices B[1] . . . B[Q] capture the graphical structure and dynamics of the
local interactions between all yi and yj  while the set of K × K matrices A = {A1 . . . A[P ]} de-
termines the large-scale graphical structure as well as the overall dynamical behavior of the system.
The processes v ∼ N (0  σ2
uI) are iid innovations injected into the system at the
global and local scale respectively.
Remark: From a graphical perspective  two latent components xk and xl are conditionally inde-
pendent given all other components xm  ∀m (cid:54)= k  l if and only if A[p]i j = 0 for all p = 1 . . . P .
Moreover  two nodes yi and yj are conditionally independent given all other nodes ym (cid:54)= i  j and
latent components xk ∀k = 1 . . . K  if and only if B[q]i j = 0 for all q = 1 . . . Q.
To create the multi-scale hierarchy in the graphical structure  the following two conditions are im-
posed: (i) each yi belong to only one global component xk  i.e. Zi kZi l = δ[k  l]  ∀i = 1 . . . N; and
(ii) Bi j be non-zero only for nodes within the same component  i.e. Bi j = 0 if yi and yj belong to
different global components xk and xk(cid:48).
The advantages of this model over a VAR graphical model are two fold: (i) the hierarchical structure 
the fact that K (cid:28) N and that yi ↔ yj only if they are in the same global component results in
a very sparse graphical model with a rich multi-scale interpretation; and (ii) as per Theorem 1  the
model of eqn. (1) is signiﬁcantly more parsimonious than an equivalent VAR model for data that is
inherently multi-scale.
Theorem 1. The model of eqn. (1) is equivalent to a vector auto-regressive moving-average
s=0 E[s][t − s] where P ≤ R ≤ P + Q and
0 ≤ S ≤ P   D[r] are N × N full-rank matrices and E[s] are N × N matrices with rank less than
K. Moreover the upper bounds are tight if the model of eqn. (1) is minimal. The proof is given in
Supplemental Appendix A.
The multi-scale spatio-temporal dynamics are modeled as stable convection–diffusion (C–D)
processes governed by hyperbolic–parabolic PDEs of the form ∂y/∂t + ∇ · ((cid:126)cy) = ∇ · κ∇ + s 
where y is the quantity corresponding to y  κ is the diffusivity and c is the convection velocity
and s is an exogenous source. The balance between convection and diffusion is quantiﬁed by the
P´eclet number2 of the system [8]. These processes are non-linear in diffusivity and velocity and
a full-physics inversion involves estimating κ and (cid:126)c at each spatial location  which is a highly
ill-posed and under-constrained[1]. However  because for systems with physically reasonable
P´eclet numbers  dynamics at larger scales can be accurately approximated on increasingly coarse
grids [13]  we simplify the model by assuming that conditioned on the rest of the system  the
large-scale dynamics between any two components xi ∼ xj | xk ∀k (cid:54)= i  j can be approximated by
a 1-d C–D system with constant P´eclet number. This approximation allows us to use Proposition 2:
Theorem 2. For the VAR system of eqn. (1)  if the dynamics between any two variables xi ∼
xj | xk ∀k (cid:54)= i  j are 1–d C–D with inﬁnite boundary conditions and constant P´eclet num-
ber  then the VAR coefﬁcients Ai j[t] can be approximated by a Gaussian function Ai j[t] ≈
i j where µi j is equal to the distance between i and j and σ2
i j
is proportional to the product of the distance and the P´eclet number. Moreover  this approximation
has a multiplicative-error exp(−O(t3)). Proof is given in Supplemental Appendix B.
In effect  the dynamics of a multi-dimensional (i.e. 2-d or 3-d) continuous spatial system are approx-
imated as a network of 1-dimensional point-to-point ﬂows consisting of a combination of advection

and diffusion. Although in general  the dynamics of higher-dimensional physical systems are not
equivalent to super-position of lower-dimensional systems  as we show in this paper  the stability of
C–D physics [13] allows replicating the large-scale graphical structure and dynamics  while avoid-
ing the ill-conditioned and computationally expensive inversion of a full-physics model. Moreover 
the stability of the C–D impulse response function ensures that the resulting VAR system is also
stable.

3 Model Relaxation and Regularization

Q(cid:88)

P(cid:88)

As the model of eqn. (1) contains non-linear interactions of real-valued variables x  A and B with
binary Z along with mixed constraints  direct estimation would require solving a mixed integer
non-linear problem. Instead  in this section we present relaxations and regularizations that allow
estimation of model parameters via convex optimization. The next theorem states that for a given
assignment of measurement sites to global components  the interactions within a component do not
affect the interactions between components  which enables replacing the mixed non-linearity due to
the constraints on B[q] with a set of unconstrained diagonal matrices C[q]  q = 1 . . . Q.
Theorem 3. For a given global-component assignment Z  if A∗ and x∗ are local optima to the
least-squares problem of eqn. (1)  then they are also a local optimum to the least-squares problem
for:

x[t] =

A[p]x[t − p] + u[t]

and

y[t] =

C[p]y[t − q] + Zx[t] + v[t] 

(2)

where C[r]  r = 1 . . . b are diagonal matrices. The proof is given in Supplemental Appendix C.

reduce the number of non-zero coefﬁcients and thereby the effective order of C .
Next  the binary indicator variables Zi k are relaxed to be real-valued. Also  an (cid:96)1 penalty  which
promotes sparsity  combined with an (cid:96)2 term has been shown to estimate disjoint clusters[19]. There-
fore  the spatial disjointedness constraint Zi kZi l = δk l  ∀i = 1 . . . N  is relaxed by a penalty propor-
tional to (cid:107)Zi ·(cid:107)1 along with the constraint that for each yi  the indicator vector Zi · should lie within
the unit sphere  i.e. (cid:107)Zi ·(cid:107)2 ≤ 1. This penalty  which also ensures that |Zi k| ≤ 1  allows interpretation
of Zi · as a soft cluster membership.
One way to regularize Ai j according to Theorem 2 would be to directly parameterize it as a Gaus-

sian function. Instead  observe that G(t) = exp(cid:8)−0.5(t − µ)2/σ2(cid:9) /
[∂t + (t − µ)/σ] G = 0  subject to (cid:82) G(t)dt = 1. Therefore  deﬁning the discrete version of this
along with the relaxed constraint 0 ≤ (cid:80)

(cid:107)D(γi j)Ai j(cid:107)2 where D (γi j)p p = (cid:98)∂p + γi j (p − µi j)  

p Ai j[p] ≤ 1. Here  (cid:98)∂p is an approximation to time-

operator as D(γi j)  a P × P diagonal matrix  the regularization A is as a penalty proportional to

(cid:107)D(γ)A(cid:107)2 1 =

(cid:88)

differentiation  µi j is equal to the distance between i and j which is known  and γi j ≥ Γ is inversely
proportional to σi j. Importantly  this formulation also admits 0 as a valid solution and has two
advantages over direct parametrization: (i) it replaces a problem that is non-linear in σ2
i j ; i  j =
1 . . . K with a penalty that is linear in Ai j; and (ii) unlike Gaussian parametrization  it admits the
sparse solution Ai j = 0 for the case when xi does not directly affect xj. The constant Γ > 0 is a user-
speciﬁed parameter which prevents γi j from taking on very small values  thereby obviation solutions
of Ai j with extremely large variance i.e. with very small but non-zero value. This penalty  derived
from considerations of the dynamics of multi-scale spatio-temporal systems  is the key difference of
the proposed method as compared to sparse time-series graphical model via group LASSO [11].
Putting it all together  the multi-scale graphical model is obtained by optimizing:

3.1 Optimization

Given values of [A  Z  C]  the problem of eqn. (4) is unconstrained and strictly convex in x and
γ and given [x  γ]  it is unconstrained and strictly convex in C and convex constrained in A and
Z. Therefore  under these conditions block coordinate descent (BCD) is guaranteed to produce a
sequence of solutions that converge to a stationary point [22]. To avoid saddle-points and achieve
local-minima  a random feasible-direction heuristic is used at stationary points. Deﬁning blocks of
variables to be [x  γ]  and [A  C  Z]  BCD operates as follows:
1 Initialize x(0) and γ(0)
2 Set n = 0 and repeat until convergence:

[A(n+1)  Z(n+1)  C(n+1)] ← min

At each iteration x(n+1) is obtained by directly solving a T × T tri-diagonal Toeplitz system with
blocks of size KP which has a have running time of O(T × KP 3) (§Supplemental Appendix D for

Remark: The hyper-parameters of the systems are multipliers λ0 . . . λ4 and threshold Γ. The term
λ0  which is proportional to σu/σv  implements a trade-off between innovations in the local and
global processes. The parameter λ1 penalizes deviation of Ai j from expected C–D dynamics  while
λ2  λ3 and λ4 control the sparsity of C  Z and B respectively. As explained earlier Γ > 0  the lower
bound on γi j  prohibits estimates of Ai j with very high variance and thereby controls the spread /
support of A.
Hyper-parameter selection: Hyper-parameter values that minimize cross-validation error are ob-
tained using grid-search. First  solutions over the full regularization path are computed with warm-
starting. In our experience  for sufﬁciently small step sizes warm-starting leads to convergence in a
few (< 5) iterations regardless of problem size. Moreover  as B is solved in a separate step  selection
of λ4 is done independently of λ0 . . . λ3. Experimentally  we have observed that an upper limit on
Γ = 1 and step-size of 0.1 is sufﬁcient to explore the space of all solutions. The upper limit on λ3
is the smallest value for which any indicator vector Zi · becomes all zero. Guidance about minimum
and maximum values λ0 is obtained using the system identiﬁcation technique of auto-correlation
least squares.

4 Results

In this section we present an application to determining the connectivity structure of a medium from
data of ﬂow through it under a potential/pressure ﬁeld. Such problems include ﬂow of ﬂuids through
porous media under pressure gradients  or transmission of electric currents through resistive media
due to potential gradients  and commonly arise in exploration geophysics in the study of sub-surface
systems like aquifers  petroleum reservoirs  ore deposits and geologic bodies [16]. Speciﬁcally 
these processes are deﬁned by PDEs of the form:

(cid:126)c + κ∇ · p = 0
∇ · (cid:126)c = sq

where

(cid:126)n · ∇(cid:126)c|∂Ω = 0

where y is the state variable (e.g. concentration or current)  p is the pressure or potential ﬁeld driving
the ﬂow  (cid:126)c is the resulting velocity ﬁeld  κ is the permeability / permittivity  sq is the pressure/poten-
tial forcing term  sy is the rate of state variable injection into the system. The domain boundary is
denoted by ∂Ω and the outward normal by (cid:126)n. The initial condition for tracer is zero over the entire
domain.
In order to permit evaluation against ground truth  we used the permeability ﬁeld in Fig. 1(a) based
on a geologic model to study the ﬂow of ﬂuids through the earth subsurface under naturally and
artiﬁcially induced pressure gradients. The data were generated by numerical simulation of eqn. (5)
using a proprietary high-ﬁdelity solver for T = 12500s with spatially varying pressure loadings
between ±100 units and with random temporal ﬂuctuations (SNR of 20dB). Random amounts of
tracer varying between 0 and 5 units were injected and concentration measured at 1s intervals at
the 275 sites marked in the image. A video of the simulation is provided as supplemental to the
manuscript  and the data and model are available on request . These concentration proﬁles at the
275 locations are used as the time-series data y input to the multi-scale graphical model of eqn. (1).
Estimation was done for K = 20  with multiple initializations and hyper-parameter selection as
described above. The K-means step was initialized by distributing seed locations uniformly at
random. The model orders P and Q were kept constant at 50 and 25 respectively. Labels and colors
of the sites in Fig. 1(b) indicate the clusters identiﬁed by the K-means step for one initialization
of the estimation procedure  while the estimated multi-scale graphical structure is shown in Figures
1(c)–(d). The global graphical structure (§Fig. 1(c)) correctly captures large-scale features in the
ground truth. Furthermore  as seen in Fig. 1(d) the local graphical structure (given by the coefﬁcients
of B) are sparse and spatially compact. Importantly  the local graphs are spatially more contiguous
than the initial K-means clusters and only approximately 40% of the labels are conserved between

Furthermore  as shown in Supplemental Appendix
F  the estimated graphical structure is fairly robust to initialization  especially in recovering the
global graph structure. For all initializations  estimation from a cold-start converged in 65–90 BCD
iterations  while warm-starts converged in < 5 iterations.

Fig. 1(e) shows the results of estimating the
multi-scale model when the penalty term of
eqn. (3) for the C–D process prior is replaced
by group LASSO. This result highlights the im-
portance of the physically derived prior to re-
construct the graphical structure of the prob-
lem. Fig. 1(f) shows the graphical structure
estimated using a non-hierarchal VAR model
with group LASSO on the coefﬁcients [11] and
auto-regressive order P = 10. Firstly  this is a
signiﬁcantly larger model with P × N 2 coefﬁ-
cients as compared O(P ×N )+O(Q×K 2) for
the hierarchical model  and is therefore much
more expensive to compute. Furthermore  the
estimated graph is denser and harder to inter-
pret in the terms of the underlying problem 
with many long range edges intermixed with
short range ones.
In all cases  model hyper-
parameters were selected via 10-fold cross-validation described in Supplemental Appendix G. In-
VAR model performs best (≈ %12.1 ± 4.4 relative error) while group LASSO and C–D penalized
hierarchal models perform equivalently ( 18.3±5.7% and 17.6±6.2%) which can be attributed to the
higher degrees of freedom available to non-hierarchical VAR. However  in terms of cross-validation
(i.e. testing) error  the VAR model was the worst ( 94.5 ± 8.9%) followed by group LASSO hierar-
chal model (48.3 ± 3.7%). The model with the C–D prior performed the best  with a relative-error
of 31.6 ± 4.5%.

To characterize the dynamics estimated by the various approaches  we compared the impulse re-
sponse functions (IRF) of the graphical models with that of the ground truth model (§eqn. (5)). The
IRF for a node i is straightforward to generate for eqn. (5)  while those for the graphical models are
obtained by setting v0[i] = 1 and v0[j] = 0 for all j (cid:54)= i and vt = 0 for t > 0 and then running
their equations forward in time. The responses at a node in global component 17 of Fig. 1(c) to an
impulse at a node in global component 1 is shown in Fig. 2. As the IRF for eqn. (5) depends on the
driving pressure ﬁeld which ﬂuctuates over time  the mean IRF along with 90% bands are shown.
It can be observed that the multi-scale model with the C–D prior is much better at replicating the
dynamical properties of the original system as compared to the model with group LASSO  while a
non-hierarchical VAR model with group LASSO fails to capture any relevant dynamics. The results
of comparing IRFs for other pairs of sites were qualitatively similar and therefore omitted.

5 Conclusion

In this paper  we proposed a new approach that combines machine-learning / data-driven techniques
with physically derived priors to reconstruct the connectivity / network structure of multi-scale
spatio-temporal systems encountered in multiple ﬁelds such as exploration geophysics  atmospheric
and ocean sciences . Simple yet computationally efﬁcient algorithms for estimating the model were
developed through a set of relaxations and regularization. The method was applied to the problem
of learning the connectivity structure for a general class of problems involving ﬂow through a per-
meable medium under pressure/potential ﬁelds and the advantages of this method over alternative
approaches were demonstrated. Current directions of investigation includes incorporating different
types of physics such as hyperbolic (i.e. wave) equations into the model. We are also investigating
applications of this technique to learning structure in other domains such as brain networks  trafﬁc
networks  and biological and social networks.
