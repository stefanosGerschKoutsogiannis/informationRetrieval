Abstract 

When  individuals  independently  recollect  events  or  retrieve  facts  from 
memory   how can  we  aggregate these retrieved memories to reconstruct the 
actual set of events or facts?  In this research   we report the  performance  of 
individuals  in  a  series  of  general  knowledge  tasks   where  the  goal  is  to 
reconstruct from memory the order of  historic events   or the order of items 
along  some  physical  dimension.  We  introduce  two  Bayesian  models  for 
aggregating  order  information  based  on  a  Thurstonian  approach  and 
Mallows  model.  Both  models  assume  that  each  individual's  reconstruction 
is based on either  a random  permutation of the  unobserved ground truth  or 
by a pure  guessing strategy. We  apply  MCMC to  make inferences  about the 
underlying  truth  and  the  strategies  employed  by  individuals.  The  models 
demonstrate  a  "wisdom  of  crowds "  effect   where  the  aggregated  or derings 
are closer to the true ordering than the orderings of the  best individual.

Many demonstrations have shown that aggregating the judgments of a number of individuals 
results  in  an  estimate  that  is  close  to  the  true  answer   a  phenomenon  that  has  come  to  be 
known  as the  “wisdom of crowds”  [1].  This  was  demonstrated  by Galton   who sho wed that 
the estimated  weight of  an ox   when  averaged  across individuals   closely  approximated the 
true  weight  [2].  Similarly  on the  game show Who Wants  to be  a Millionaire  contestants  are 
given  the  opportunity  to  ask  all  members  of  the  audience  to  answer  multiple  choice 
questions.  Over  several  seasons  of  the  show   the  modal  response  of  the  audience 
corresponded  to  the  correct  answer  91%  of  the  time.  More  sophisticated  aggregation 
approaches  have  been  developed  for  multiple  choice  tasks   such  as  Cult ural  Consensus 
Theory  that  additionally take  differences across indi viduals  and items into  account  [3].  The 
wisdom  of  crowds  idea  is  currently  used  in  several  real-world  applications   such  as 
prediction  markets  [4]   spam  filtering   and  the  prediction  of  consumer  preferences  through 
collaborative  filtering.  Recently   it  was  shown  that  a  form  of  the  wisdom  of  crowds 
phenomenon  also  occurs  within  a  single  person  [5].  Averaging  multiple  guesses  from  one 
person provides better estimates than the individual guesses. 

We  are  interested  in  applying  this  wisdom  of  crowds  phenomenon  to  human  memory 
involving  situations  where  individuals  have  to  retrieve  information  more  complex  than 
single  numerical  estimates  or  answers  to  multiple  choice  questions.  We  will  focus  here  on 
memory  for  order  information.  For  example   we  test  individuals  on  their  ability  to 
reconstruct  from  memory  the  order  of  historic  events  (e.g.   the  order  of  US  presidents)   or 
the magnitude along some  physical dimension (e.g.  the order of largest  US cities). We then 
develop computational models that infer distributions over orderings to explain the observed 
orderings  across individuals.  The  goal is to  demonstrate  a  wisdom of crowds effects  where 

the  inferred  orderings  are  closer  to  the  actual  ordering  than  the  orderings  produced  by  the 
majority of individuals.  

Aggregating  rank  order  data  is  not  a  new  problem.  In  social  choice  theory   a  number  of  
systems  have  been  developed  for  aggregating  rank  order  preferences  for  groups  (Marden  
1995).  Preferential  voting  systems   where  voters  explicitly  rank  order  their  candidate 
preferences   are  designed  to  pick  one  or  several  candidates  out  of  a  field  of  man y.  These 
systems   such  as  the  Borda  count   perform  well  in  aggregating  the  individuals'  rank  order 
data  but with an inherent bias towards determining the top members of the list.  However  as 
voting  is  a  means  for  expressing  individual  preferences   there  is  no  ground  truth.  The  goal 
for these systems is to  determine  an  aggregate of  preferences that is in some sense  “fair” to 
all  members  of  the  group.  The  rank  aggregation  problem  has  also  been  studied  in  machine 
learning  and information retrieval   [6 7]. For example  if one is presented  with  a ranked list 
of  webpages  from  several  search  engines   how  can  these  be  combined  to  create  a  single 
ranking that is more accurate and less sensitive to spam?   

Relatively little research  has been  done on the rank order  aggregation problem  with the  goal 
of  approximating  a  known  ground  truth.  In  follow-ups  to  Galton's  work   some  experiments 
were performed testing the ability of individuals to rank-order magnitudes in psychophysical 
experiments  [8]. Also   an informal  aggregation  model for rank order  data  was developed for 
the  Cultural  Consensus  Theory   using  factor  analysis  of  the  covariance  structure  of  rank 
order judgments  [3].  This  was  used to (partially) recover the order of causes of  death in the 
US on the basis of the individual orderings. 

We  present  empirical  and  theoretical  research  on  the  wisdom  of  crowds  phenomenon  for 
rank  order  aggregation.  No  communication  between  people  is  allowed  for  these  tasks   and 
therefore  the  aggregation  method  operates  on  the  data  produced  b y  independent  decision-
makers.  Importantly   for  all  of  the  problems  there  is  a  known  ground  truth.  We  compare 
several  heuristic computational  approaches―based on  voting theory  and existing models of 
social choice―that  analyze the individual judgments  and provide  a single  answer  as output  
which  can  be  compared  to  the  ground  truth.  We  refer  to  these  synthesized  answers  as 
“group”  answers  because  they  capture  the  collective  wisdom  of  the  group   even  though  no 
communication  between  group members occurred. We  also  apply  probabilistic models based 
on a Thurstonian approach and Mallows model. The Thurstonian model represents the group 
knowledge  about  items  as  distributions  on  an  interval  dimension   [9].  Mallows  model  is  a 
distance-based  model  that  represents  the  group  answer  as  a  modal  ordering  of  items   and 
assumes each individual to  have orderings that  are  more or less close to the modal ordering  
[10].  Although  Thurstonian  and  Mallows  type  of  models  have   often  been  used  to  analyze 
preference  rankings   [11]   they  have   not  been  applied   as  far  as  we  are  aware   to  ordering 
problems  where  there  is  a  ground  truth.  We  also  present  extensions  of  these  models  that 
allow for the  possibility of different response strategies―some individuals  might  be purely 
guessing  because  they  have  no  knowledge  of  the  problem  and  others  might  have  partial 
knowledge of   the  ground truth. We develop efficient MCMC  algorithms to infer the latent 
group  orderings  and  assignments  of  individuals  to  response  strategies.  The  advantage  of 
MCMC estimation  procedure is that it  gives a  probability  distribution over  group orderings  
and we can therefore assess the likelihood of any particular group ordering.

Participants  were  78  undergraduate  students  at  t he  University  of  California   Irvine.  The 
experiment  was  composed  of  17  questions  involving  general  knowledge  regarding: 
population statistics (4  questions)  geography (3  questions)   dates  such  as release  dates for 
movies  and books (7  questions)  U.S. Presidents  material  hardness  the 10 Commandments  
and the first 10 Amendments of the U.S. Co nstitution. An interactive interface was presented 
on  a computer screen. Participants  were instructed to order the  presented items (e.g.   “Order 
these  books  by their first release  date  earliest to most recent”)   and responded  by  dragging 
the individual items on the screen to the desired location in the ordering. The initial ordering 
of the 10 items within a question was randomized across all questions and all participants.

R e s ul t s  

To  evaluate  the  performance  of  participants  as  well  as  models   we  measured  the  distance 
between  the  reconstructed  and  the  correct  ordering.  A  commonly  used  distance  metric  for 
orderings  is  Kendall’s  τ.  This  distance  metric  counts  the  number  of  adjacent  pairwise 
disagreements between orderings . Values of τ range from:  0  ≤  τ  ≤  𝑁(𝑁 − 1)/2  where N is 
the  number  of  items  in  the  order  (10  for  all  of  our  questions).  A  value  of  zero  means  the 
ordering is exactly right  and a value of one means that the ordering is correct except for two 
neighboring items being transposed  and so on up to the maximum po ssible value of 45. 

Table  1  shows  all  unique  orderings   by  column   that  were  produced  for  two  problems: 
arranging  U.S.  States  by  east-west  location   and  sorting  U.S.  Presidents  by  the  time  they 
served  in  office.  The  correct  ordering  is  shown  on  the  right.  The  columns  are  sorted  by 
Kendall's  τ  distance.  The  first  and  second  number  below  each  ordering  correspond  to 
Kendall's  τ distance  and the number of participants  who  produced the ordering  respectively. 
These  two  examples  show  that  only  a  small  number  of  participants  reproduce d  the  correct 
ordering (in fact  for 11 out of 17  problems  no  participant  gave the correct  answer).  It  also 
shows  that  very  few  orderings  are  produced  by  m ultiple  participants.  For  8  out  of  17 
problems  each participant produced a unique ordering.   

To  summarize  the  results  across  participants   the  column  labeled  PC  in  Table  2  shows  the 
proportion  of  individuals  who  got  the  ordering  exactly  right  for  each  of  the  ordering  task 
questions. On  average  about one  percent of  participants recreated the correct rank ordering 
perfectly.  The  column  τ   shows  the  mean  τ  values  over  the  population  of  participants  for 
each  of  the  17  sorting  task  questions.  As  this  is  a  prior  knowledge  task   it  is  interesting  to 
note the best  performance overall  was  achieved on the Presidents   States from  west to east  
Oscar  movies   and Movie release  dates tas ks. These four questions relate to educational  and 
cultural knowledge that seems most likely to be shared by our undergraduate subjects.  

Finally   an important summary statistic is the  performance of  the best individual.  Instead of 
picking  the  best  individual  separately  for  each  problem   we  find  the  individual  who  scores 
best  across all  problems.  Table 2   bottom row  shows that this individual  has on  average  a  τ 
distance  of  7.8.  To  demonstrate  the  wisdom  of  crowds  effect   we  have  to  show  that  the 
synthesized group ordering outperforms the ordering  on average  of this best individual.

We evaluated a number of aggregation models on their ability to reconstruct the ground truth 
based  on  the  group  ordering  inferred  from  individual  orderings.  First   we  evaluate  two 
heuristic  methods  from  social  choice  theory  based  on  the  mode  and  Borda  counts.    One 
drawback of such  heuristic aggregation models is that they create  no explicit representation 
of each individual's working knowledge. Therefore  even though such methods can aggregate

the individual  pieces of  knowledge  across individuals  they cannot explain  why individuals 
rank  the  items  in  a  particular  way.  To  address  this  potential  weakness   we  develop  two 
simple probabilistic models based on the Thurstonian approach [9] and Mallows model [10].

We tested two heuristic aggregation models. In the simplest heuristic  based on the mode  the 
group  answer is  based on the most frequently occurring sequence of  all observed sequences. 
In  cases  where  several  different  sequences  correspond  to  the  mode   a  ra ndomly  chosen 
modal sequence was picked. The second method uses the Borda count method  a widely used 
technique from voting theory. In the Borda count method  weighted counts are assigned such 
that the first choice “candidate” receives a count of  N (where N is the number of candidates)  
the  second  choice  candidate  receives  a  count  of  N-1   and  so  on.  These  counts  are  summed 
across  candidates  and  the  candidate  with  the  highest  count  is  considered  the  “most 
preferred”. Here  we use the Borda count to create an ordering over all items by ordering the 
Borda counts.   

Table  2  reports  the  performance  of  all  of  the  aggregation  models.  For  each   we  checked 
whether the inferred  group order is correct (C)  and measured Kendall's τ. We  also report in 
the rank column the percentage of  participants  who  perform  worse or the same as the  group 
answer  as measured by τ. With the rank statistic  we can verify the wisdom of crowds effect. 
In  an  ideal  model   the  aggregate  answer  should  be  as  good  as  or  better  than  all  of  the 
individuals in the group. Table 1 shows the results separately for each problem  and averaged 
across all the problems.  

These  results  show  that  the  mode  heuristic  leads  to  the  worst  performance  overall  in  rank. 
On  average   the  mode  is  as  good  or  better  of  an  estimate  than  68%  of  participants.  This 
means  that  32%  of  participants  came  up  with  better  solutions  individually.  This  is  not 
surprising  since  with an ordering of 10 items  it is possible that only a few participants will 
agree  on  the  ordering  of  items.  The  difficulty  in  inferring  the  mode  makes  it  an  unreliable 
method  for  constructing  a  group  answer.  This  problem  will  be  exacerbated  for  orderings 
involving  more  than  10  items   as  the  number  of  possible  orderings  grows  combinatorially. 
The  Borda  count  method  performs  relatively  well  in  terms  of  Kendall's  τ  and  overall  rank 
performance.  On  average   these  methods  perform  with  ranks  of  85%   indicating  that  the 
group  answers  from  these  methods  score  amongst  the  best  individuals .  On  average   the 
Borda count has  an  average distance of 7.47   which outperforms the  best individual over  all 
problems.

A  Th u r s to ni an   M o d el  

In  the  Thurstonian  approach   the  overall  item  knowledge  for  the  group  is  represented 
explicitly  as  a  set  of  coordinates  on  an  interval  dimension.  The  interval  representation  is 
justifiable   at  least  for  some  of  the  problems  in  our  study  that  involve  one -dimensional 
concepts  such  as the relative timing of events  or the lengths of items. We  will introduce  an 
extension  of  the  Thurstonian  approach  where  the  orderings  of  some  of  the  individuals  are 
drawn from  a Thurstonian  model  and others are  drawn  are  based on  a  guessing  process  with 
no relation to the underlying interval representation.  

To  introduce  the  basic  Thurstonian  approach   let  N  be  the  number  of  items  in  the  ordering 
task and M the number of individuals ordering the items. Each item is represented as a value 
𝜇𝑖  along  this  dimension   where  𝑖 ϵ  1 …   𝑁 .  Each  individual  is  assumed  to  have  access  to  
this  group-level information. Ho wever  individuals  might  not  have precise  knowledge about 
the exact location of each item. We model each individual's location of the item  by  a single 
sample  from  a  Normal  distribution   centered  on  the  item’s  group  location.  Specifically   in 
our model   whe n  determining the order of items   a  person  𝑗 ϵ  1  …   𝑀  samples  a  value from 
each  item  𝑖   𝑥𝑖𝑗   ~ N 𝜇𝑖  𝜎𝑖 .  The  standard  deviation  𝜎𝑖  captures  the  uncertainty  that 
individuals  have  about item  𝑖 and the samples  𝑥𝑖𝑗  represent the mental representation for the 
individual.  The ordering for each individual is then  based on the ordering of their samples. 
Let  𝒚𝑗  be the observed ordering of the items for individual  j so that  𝒚𝑗 = (𝑖1  𝑖2  …   𝑖𝑁) if and 
only  if  𝑥𝑖1 𝑗 < 𝑥𝑖2𝑗 < ⋯ <   𝑥𝑖𝑁 𝑗 .  Figure  1  (left  panel)  shows  an  example  of  this  basic 
Thurstonian  model  with  group-level  information  for  three  items   A   B   and  C  and  two 
individuals. In the illustration  there is a larger degree of overlap between the representations 
for B  and  C making it likely that items  B  and C  are transposed (as illustrated for the second 
individual). 

We extend this  basic  Thurstonian  model  by incorporating  a  guessing component. We found 
this to be a necessary extension because some individuals in the ordering tasks actually were

Figure  3.  Sample  Thurstonian  inferred  distributions.  The  vertical  order  is  the  ground  truth 
ordering  while the numbers in parentheses show the inferred group ordering 

not familiar  with  any of the items in the ordering tasks (such  as the  Ten  Commandments  or 
ten  amendents).  In the extended  Thurstonian model  the ordering of such  cases  are  assumed 
to  originate  from  a  single  distribution     𝑥𝑖𝑗  ~ N  𝜇0  𝜎0    where  no  distinction  is  made 
between  the  different  items―all  samples  come  from  the  same  distribution  with  parameters 
 𝜇0  𝜎0.  Therefore   the  orderings  produced  by  the  individuals  under  this  model  are 
completely random.   For example  Figure 1  right  panel shows two orderings  produced from 
this  guessing  model.  We  associate  a  latent  state  𝑧𝑗  with  each  individual  that  determines 
whether  the  ordering  from  each  individual  is  produced  by  the  guessing  model  or  the 
Thurstonian mo del: 

 

 𝑥𝑖𝑗  | 𝜇𝑖   𝜎𝑖  𝜇0   𝜎0  ~  

 N  𝜇𝑖   𝜎𝑖 
𝑧𝑗 = 1
  N  𝜇0  𝜎0  𝑧𝑗 = 0.

To  complete  the  model   we  placed  a  standard  prior  on  all  normal  distributions   𝑝 𝜇  𝜎  ∝
1 𝜎2  .  Figure 2a shows the  graphical  model for the  Thurstonian  model. Although the  model 
looks  straightforward  as  a  hierarchical  model   inference  in  this  model  has  proven  to  be 
difficult  because  the  observed  variable  𝒚𝑗  is  a  deterministic  ranking  function  (indicated  by 
the double bordered circle) of the underlying latent variable  𝒙𝑗 . The basic Thurstonian model 
was  introduced  by  Thurstone  in  1927   but  only  recently  have  MCMC  methods  been 
developed for estimation  [12]. We  developed a simplified MCMC  procedure  as  described in 
the  supplementary  materials  that  allows  for  efficient  estimation  of  the  underlying  true 
ordering  as well as the assignment of individuals to response strategies.   

The  results  of  the  extended  Thurstonian  model  are  shown  in  Table  2.  The  model  performs 
approximately  as  well  as  the  Borda  count  method.  The  model  does  not  recover  the  exact 
answer for  any of the 17 problems   based on the  knowledge provided  by the 78 participants. 
It is possible that a larger sample size is needed in order to achieve perfect reconstructions of 
the  ground  truth.  However   the  model   on  average   has  an  distance  of  7.29  from  the  actual 
truth  which is better than the best individual over all problems.  

One advantage of the  probabilistic  approach  is that it  gives insight into the  difficulty of the 
task  and  the  response  strategies  of  individuals.  For  some  problems   such  as  the  Ten 
Commandments    32%  of  individuals  were  assigned  to  the  guessing  strategy  ( 𝑧𝑗 = 0).  For 
other  problems   such  as  the  US  Presidents    only  16%  of  individuals  were  assigned  to  the 
guessing strategy  indicating that knowledge  about this domain  was  more  widely  distributed 
in our group of individuals. Therefore  the extension of the Thurstonia n model can eliminate 
individuals who are purely guessing the answers.    

An  advantage  of  the  representation  underlying  the  Thurstonian  model  is  that  it  allows  a 
visualization of group knowledge not only in terms of the order of items  but also in terms of 
the  uncertainty  associated  with each item on the interval scale.  Figure 3 shows the inferred 
distributions  for  four  problems  where  the  model  performed  relatively  well.  The  crosses 
correspond  to  the  mean  of  𝜇𝑖  across  all  samples   and  the  error  bars  represent  the  standard

These  visualizations  are

instance   nearly  all  participants  were able to identify  Maine  as the  easternmost state in our 
list   but  many  confused  the  central  states.    Li kewise   there  was  a  large  agreement  on  the 
proper  placement of  "the right to bear  arms " in the  amendments  question ― this  amendment 
is often popularly referred to as “The Second Amendment”.

inappropriate  for  some  problems.  For  example  

One  drawback  of  the  Thurstonian  model  is  that  it  gives  an  analog  representation  for  each 
item   which  might  be 
it  seems 
psychologically  implausible  that  the  ten  amendments  or  Ten  Commandments   are  mentally 
represented  as  coordinates  on  an  interval  scale.  Therefore   we  also  applied  probabilistic 
models  where  the  group  answer  is  based  on  a  pure  rank  ordering.  One  such  a  model  is 
Mallows model  [7  9  10]  a  distance-based model that  assumes that observed orderings that 
are  close  to  the  group  ordering  are  more  likely  than  those  far  away.  One  instantiation  of 
Mallows  model  is  based  on  Kendall's  distance  to  measure  the  number  of  pairwise 
permutations between the  group order and the individual order.  Specifically  t he  probability 
of any observed order 𝒚  given the group order 𝝎 is:  

 

 𝑝 𝒚|𝝎  𝜃  =

1

Ψ 𝜃  

𝑒−𝜃𝑑 𝒚 𝝎   

(2) 

where  𝑑  is  the  Kendall's  distance.  The  scaling  parameter  𝜃  determines  how  close  the 
observed  orders  are  to  the  group  ordering.  As  described  by  [7]   the  normalization  function 
Ψ 𝜃  does not depend on 𝜔 and can be calculated efficiently by:  

 

Ψ 𝜃  =   1−𝑒 −𝑖𝜃
1−𝑒−𝜃

𝑁
𝑖=1

 . 

(3) 

The  model  as  stated  in  the  Eqs.  (2)  and  (3)  describe  that  standard  Mallows  model  that  has 
often been used to model preference ranking data. We now introduce a si mple variant of this 
model that allows for contaminants. The idea is that some of the individuals orderings do not 
originate  at  all  from  some  common  group  knowledge   and  instead  are  based  on  a  guessing 
process.  The  extended  model  introduces  a  latent  state  𝑧𝑗   where  𝑧𝑗 = 1  if  the  individual  j 
produced the ordering  based on Mallows  model and  𝑧𝑗 = 0 if the individual is  guessing. We 
model  guessing  by  choosing  an  ordering  uniformly  from  all  possible  orderings  of  N  items. 
Therefore  in the extended model  we have 

 

 𝑝 𝒚𝒋|𝝎 𝜃  𝑧𝑗   =  

Ψ 𝜃  

1

𝑒−𝜃𝑑  𝒚 𝝎 

1/𝑁!

𝑧𝑗 = 1
𝑧𝑗 = 0.

   

(4) 

To  complete  the  model   we  place  a  Bernoulli(1/2)  prior  over  𝑧𝑗 .  The  MCMC  inference 
algorithm  to  estimate  the  distribution  over  𝝎   𝒛  and  𝜃  given  the  observed  data  is  based  on 
earlier  work      [6]. We extended the  algorithm to estimate  𝒛  and  also  allow for the efficient 
estimation  of  𝜃.  The  details  of  the  inference  procedure  are  described  in  the  supplementary 
materials.   

The result of the inference  algorithm is a  probability  distribution over  group  answers  𝝎  of 
which we take the mode as the single answer for a particular problem.  Note that the inferred 
group  ordering  does  not  have  to  correspond  with  an  ordering  of  any  particular  individual. 
The  model just finds the ordering that is close to all of the observed orderings  except  those 
that  can  be  better  explained  by  a  guessing  process.  Figure  4  illustrates  the  model  solution 
based  on  a  single  MCMC  sample  for  the  Ten  Commandments  and  ten  amendment  sorting 
tasks.  The figure shows the  distribution of distances from the inferred  group ordering. Each 
circle corresponds to an individual. Individuals assigned to Mallows  model and the guessing 
model  are  illustrated  by  filled  and  unfilled  circles  respectively.  The  solid  and  dashed  red 
lines  show  the  expected  distributions  based  on  the  model  parameters.  Note  that  although 
Mallows model describes an exponential falloff in probability based on the distance from the 
group  ordering   the  expected  distributions  also  take  into  account  the  number  of  orderings 
that exist at each distance (see [11]  page 79  for a recursive algorithm to compute this).

Figure 4 shows the    distribution over individuals that  are captured  by the two routes in the  
model.  The  individuals  with  a  Kendall's  τ  above  below  15  tend  to  be  assigned  to  Mallows 
route  and  all  other  individuals  are  assigned  to  the  the  guessing  route.  Interestingly   the 
distribution  over  distances  appears  to  be  bimodal   especially  for  the  Ten  Commandments . 
The middle peak of the distribution occurs at 22  which is close to the expected value of 22.5 
based  on  guessing.  This  result  seems  intuitively  plausible  --  not  everybody  has  studied  the 
Ten Commandments  let alone the order in which they occur.  

Table  2  shows  the  results  for  the  extended  Mallows  model  across  all  17  problems.  The 
overall  performance   in  terms  of  Kendall 's  τ  and  rank  is  comparable  to  the  Thurstonian 
model  and  the  Borda  count  method.  Therefore   there  does  not  appear  to  be  any  overall 
advantage  of  this  particular  approach.  For  the  Ten  Commandments   and  ten  amendment 
sorting tasks   Mallows  model performs the same or  better than the  Thurstonian model.  This 
suggests  that  for  particular  ordering  tasks   where  there  is  arguably  no  underl ying  analog 
representation   a  pure  rank-ordering  representation  such  as  Mallows  model  might  have  an 
advantage.

We  have  presented  two   heuristic  aggregation  approaches   as  well  as  two  probabilistic  
approaches  for the  problem of  aggregating rank orders to uncover  a  ground truth.  For each 
problem   we  found  that  there  were  individuals  who  performed  better  than  the  aggregation 
models (although  we cannot identify these individuals  until after the fact). However   across 
all problems   no  person consistently outperformed the  model.  Therefore  for  all aggregation 
methods   except  for  the  mode   we  demonstrated  a  wisdom  of  crowds  effect   where  the 
average performance of the model was better than the best individual over all problems.  

We  also  presented  two  probabilistic  approaches  based  on  the  classic  Thurstonian  and 
Mallows  approach.  While  neither  of  these  models  outperformed  the  simple  Borda  count 
heuristic  models  they  do  have some  advantages over them. The Thurstonian model not only 
extracts  a  group  ordering   but  also  a  representation  of  the  uncertainty  associated  with  the 
ordering. This can be visualized to gain insight into mental representations and processes. In 
addition   the  Thurstonian  and  Mallows  models  were  both  extended  with  a  guessing 
component to allow for the  possibility that some individuals simply  do  not  know  any of the 
answers for a particular problem. Finally  although not explored here  the Bayesian approach 
potentially offers  advantages over  heuristic  approaches  because the  probabilistic model can 
be  easily  expanded  with  additional  sources  of  knowledge   such  as  confidence  judgments 
from participants and background knowledge about t he items.
