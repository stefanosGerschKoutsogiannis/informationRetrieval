Abstract

We propose a method for automatically answering questions about images by
bringing together recent advances from natural language processing and computer
vision. We combine discrete reasoning with uncertain predictions by a multi-
world approach that represents uncertainty about the perceived world in a bayesian
framework. Our approach can handle human questions of high complexity about
realistic scenes and replies with range of answer like counts  object classes  in-
stances and lists of them. The system is directly trained from question-answer
pairs. We establish a ﬁrst benchmark for this task that can be seen as a modern
attempt at a visual turing test.

Introduction

As vision techniques like segmentation and object recognition begin to mature  there has been an
increasing interest in broadening the scope of research to full scene understanding. But what is
meant by “understanding” of a scene and how do we measure the degree of “understanding”? Most
often “understanding” refers to a correct labeling of pixels  regions or bounding boxes in terms of
semantic annotations. All predictions made by such methods inevitably come with uncertainties
attached due to limitations in features or data or even inherent ambiguity of the visual input.
Equally strong progress has been made on the language side  where methods have been proposed
that can learn to answer questions solely from question-answer pairs [1]. These methods operate on
a set of facts given to the system  which is refered to as a world. Based on that knowledge the answer
is inferred by marginalizing over multiple interpretations of the question. However  the correctness
of the facts is a core assumption.
We like to unite those two research directions by addressing a question answering task based on real-
world images. To combine the probabilistic output of state-of-the-art scene segmentation algorithms 
we propose a Bayesian formulation that marginalizes over multiple possible worlds that correspond
to different interpretations of the scene.
To date  we are lacking a substantial dataset that serves as a benchmark for question answering on
real-world images. Such a test has high demands on “understanding” the visual input and tests a
whole chain of perception  language understanding and deduction. This very much relates to the
“AI-dream” of building a turing test for vision. While we are still not ready to test our vision system
on completely unconstrained settings that were envisioned in early days of AI  we argue that a
question-answering task on complex indoor scenes is a timely step in this direction.

Contributions:
In this paper we combine automatic  semantic segmentations of real-world scenes
with symbolic reasoning about questions in a Bayesian framework by proposing a multi-world
approach for automatic question answering. We introduce a novel dataset of more than 12 000

question-answer pairs on RGBD images produced by humans  as a modern approach to a visual
turing test. We benchmark our approach on this new challenge and show the advantages of our
multi-world approach. Furthermore  we provide additional insights regarding the challenges that lie
ahead of us by factoring out sources of error from different components.

Semantic parsers: Our work is mainly inspired by [1] that learns the semantic representation for
the question answering task solely based on questions and answers in natural language. Although
the architecture learns the mapping from weak supervision  it achieves comparable results to the
semantic parsers that rely on manual annotations of logical forms ([2]  [3]). In contrast to our work 
[1] has never used the semantic parser to connect the natural language to the perceived world.
Language and perception: Previous work [4  5] has proposed models for the language grounding
problem with the goal of connecting the meaning of the natural language sentences to a perceived
world. Both methods use images as the representation of the physical world  but concentrate rather
on constrained domain with images consisting of very few objects. For instance [5] considers only
two mugs  monitor and table in their dataset  whereas [4] examines objects such as blocks  plastic
food  and building bricks. In contrast  our work focuses on a diverse collection of real-world indoor
RGBD images [6] - with many more objects in the scene and more complex spatial relationship
between them. Moreover  our paper considers complex questions - beyond the scope of [4] and [5]
- and reasoning across different images using only textual question-answer pairs for training. This
imposes additional challenges for the question-answering engines such as scalability of the semantic
parser  good scene representation  dealing with uncertainty in the language and perception  efﬁcient
inference and spatial reasoning. Although others [7  8] propose interesting alternatives for learning
the language binding  it is unclear if such approaches can be used to provide answers on questions.
Integrated systems that execute commands: Others [9  10  11  12  13] focus on the task of learn-
ing the representation of natural language in the restricted setting of executing commands. In such
scenario  the integrated systems execute commands given natural language input with the goal of us-
ing them in navigation. In our work  we aim for less restrictive scenario with the question-answering
system in the mind. For instance  the user may ask our architecture about counting and colors (’How
many green tables are in the image?’)  negations (’Which images do not have tables?’) and superla-
tives (’What is the largest object in the image?’).
Probabilistic databases: Similarly to [14] that reduces Named Entity Recognition problem into the
inference problem from probabilistic database  we sample multiple-worlds based on the uncertainty
introduced by the semantic segmentation algorithm that we apply to the visual input.

3 Method

Our method answers on questions based on images by combining natural language input with output
from visual scene analysis in a probabilistic framework as illustrated in Figure 1. In the single world
approach  we generate a single perceived world W based on segmentations - a unique interpretation
of a visual scene. In contrast  our multi-world approach integrates over many latent worlds W  and
hence taking different interpretations of the scene and question into account.

Single-world approach for question answering problem We build on recent progress on end-to-
end question answering systems that are solely trained on question-answer pairs (Q  A) [1]. Top part
of Figure 1 outlines how we build on [1] by modeling the logical forms associated with a question as
latent variable T given a single world W. More formally the task of predicting an answer A given
a question Q and a world W is performed by computing the following posterior which marginalizes
over the latent logical forms (semantic trees in [1]) T :

(cid:88)

T

P (A|Q W) :=

P (A|T  W)P (T |Q).

(1)

P (A|T  W) corresponds to denotation of a logical form T on the world W.
In this setting 
the answer is unique given the logical form and the world: P (A|T  W) = 1[A ∈ σW (T )]
with the evaluation function σW  which evaluates a logical form on the world W. Following
[1] we use DCS Trees that yield the following recursive evaluation function σW: σW (T ) :=

the semantic tree with a predicate p associated with the current node  its subtrees T1 T2  ... Td  and
relations Rj that deﬁne the relationship between the current node and a subtree Tj.
In the predictions  we use a log-linear distribution P (T |Q) ∝ exp(θT φ(Q T )) over the logical
forms with a feature vector φ measuring compatibility between Q and T and parameters θ learnt
from training data. Every component φj is the number of times that a speciﬁc feature template
occurs in (Q T ). We use the same templates as [1]: string triggers a predicate  string is under a
relation  string is under a trace predicate  two predicates are linked via relation and a predicate has
a child. The model learns by alternating between searching over a restricted space of valid trees
and gradient descent updates of the model parameters θ. We use the Datalog inference engine to
produce the answers from the latent logical forms. The linguistic phenomena such as superlatives
and negations are handled by the logical forms and the inference engine. For a detailed exposition 
we refer the reader to [1].

Question answering on real-world images based on a perceived world Similar to [5]  we
extend the work of [1] to operate now on what we call perceived world W. This still corre-
sponds to the single world approach in our overview Figure 1. However our world is now popu-
lated with “facts” derived from automatic  semantic image segmentations S. For this purpose  we
build the world by running a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation algorithm [15] over the im-
ages and collect the recognized information about objects such as object class  3D position  and

(a) Sampled worlds.

(b) Object’s coordinates.

Figure 2: Fig. 2a shows a few sampled worlds where only segments of the class ’person’ are shown. In the
clock-wise order: original picture  most conﬁdent world  and three possible worlds (gray-scale values denote
the class conﬁdence). Although  at ﬁrst glance the most conﬁdent world seems to be a reasonable approach 
our experiments show opposite - we can beneﬁt from imperfect but multiple worlds. Fig. 2b shows object’s
coordinates (original and Z  Y   X images in the clock-wise order)  which better represent the spatial location
of the objects than the image coordinates.

predicate(instance id  image id  color  spatial loc) where predicate ∈ {bag  bed  books  ...} 
instance id is the object’s id  image id is id of the image containing the object  color is esti-
mated color of the object [16]  and spatial loc is the object’s position in the image. Latter is

a more meaningful representation of the object’s coordinates over simple image coordinates. The
complete schema will be documented together with the code release.
We realize that the skilled use of spatial relations is a complex task and grounding spatial relations
is a research thread on its own (e.g. [17]  [18] and [19]). For our purposes  we focus on predeﬁned
relations shown in Table 1  while the association of them as well as the object classes are still dealt
within the question answering architecture.

Multi-worlds approach for combining uncertain visual perception and symbolic reasoning
Up to now we have considered the output of the semantic segmentation as “hard facts”  and hence
ignored uncertainty in the class labeling. Every such labeling of the segments corresponds to dif-
ferent interpretation of the scene - different perceived world. Drawing on ideas from probabilistic
databases [14]  we propose a multi-world approach (Figure 1 - lower part) that marginalizes over
multiple possible worlds W - multiple interpretations of a visual scene - derived from the segmen-
tation S. Therefore the posterior over the answer A given question Q and semantic segmentation S
of the image marginalizes over the latent worlds W and logical forms T :

The semantic segmentation of the image is a set of segments si with the associated probabilities
ˆSf =(cid:8)(s1  cf (1))  (s2  cf (2))  ...  (sk  cf (k)))(cid:9) be an assignment of the categories into segments of
pij over the C object categories cj. More precisely S = {(s1  L1)  (s2  L2)  ...  (sk  Lk)} where
Li = {(cj  pij)}C
j=1  P (si = cj) = pij  and k is the number of segments of given image. Let
{1 ... k}. With such notation  for
(cid:81)
the image according to the binding function f ∈ F = {1  ...  C}
a ﬁxed binding function f  a world W is a set of tuples consistent with ˆSf   and deﬁne P (W|S) =
i p(i f (i)). Hence we have as many possible worlds as binding functions  that is C k. Eq. 2 becomes
quickly intractable for k and C seen in practice  wherefore we use a sampling strategy that draws a
ﬁnite sample (cid:126)W = (W1 W2  ... WN ) from P (·|S) under an assumption that for each segment si
every object’s category cj is drawn independently according to pij. A few sampled perceived worlds
are shown in Figure 2a.

Regarding the computational efﬁciency  computing(cid:80)T P (A | Wi T )P (T | Q) can be done inde-

pendently for every Wi  and therefore in parallel without any need for synchronization. Since for
small N the computational costs of summing up computed probabilities is marginal  the overall cost
is about the same as single inference modulo parallelism. The presented multi-world approach to
question answering on real-world scenes is still an end-to-end architecture that is trained solely on
the question-answer pairs.

Implementation and Scalability For worlds containing many facts and spatial relations the in-
duction step becomes computationally demanding as it considers all pairs of the facts (we have
about 4 million predicates in the worst case). Therefore we use a batch-based approximation in such
situations. Every image induces a set of facts that we call a batch of facts. For every test image  we
ﬁnd k nearest neighbors in the space of training batches with a boolean variant of TF.IDF to mea-
sure similarity [20]. This is equivalent to building a training world from k images with most similar
content to the perceived world of the test image. We use k = 3 and 25 worlds in our experiments.

4 Experiments
4.1 DAtaset for QUestion Answering on Real-world images (DAQUAR)
Images and Semantic Segmentation Our new dataset for question answering is built on top of
the NYU-Depth V2 dataset [6]. NYU-Depth V2 contains 1449 RGBD images together with anno-
tated semantic segmentations (Figure 3) where every pixel is labeled into some object class with a
conﬁdence score. Originally 894 classes are considered. According to [15]  we preprocess the data
to obtain canonical views of the scenes and use X  Y   Z coordinates from the depth sensor to deﬁne
spatial placement of the objects in 3D. To investigate the impact of uncertainty in the visual analysis
of the scenes  we also employ computer vision techniques for automatic semantic segmentation. We
use a state-of-the-art scene analysis method [15] which maps every pixel into 40 classes: 37 infor-
mative object classes as well as ’other structure’  ’other furniture’ and ’other prop’. We ignore the
latter three. We use the same data split as [15]: 795 training and 654 test images. To use our spatial
representation on the image content  we ﬁt 3d cuboids to the segmentations.
New dataset of questions and answers
In the spirit of a visual turing test  we collect question
answer pairs from human annotators for the NYU dataset. In our work  we consider two types of the
annotations: synthetic and human. The synthetic question-answer pairs are automatically generated
question-answer pairs  which are based on the templates shown in Table 2. These templates are then
instantiated with facts from the database. To collect 12468 human question-answer pairs we ask 5
in-house participants to provide questions and answers. They were instructed to give valid answers
that are either basic colors [16]  numbers or objects (894 categories) or sets of those. Besides the
answers  we don’t impose any constraints on the questions. We also don’t correct the questions as
we believe that the semantic parsers should be robust under the human errors. Finally  we use 6794
training and 5674 test question-answer pairs – about 9 pairs per image on average (8.63  8.75)2.

2Our notation (x  y) denotes mean x and trimean y. We use Tukey’s trimean 1

4 (Q1 + 2Q2 + Q3)  where Qj
denotes the j-th quartile [21]. This measure combines the beneﬁts of both median (robustness to the extremes)
and empirical mean (attention to the hinge values).

For
instance we have more than 400 occurrences of table and chair in the answers.
In average the
object’s category occurs (14.25  4) times in training set and (22.48  5.75) times in total. Figure 4
shows example question-answer pairs together with the corresponding image that illustrate some of
the challenges captured in this dataset.
Performance Measure While the quality of an answer that the system produces can be measured
in terms of accuracy w.r.t.
the ground truth (correct/wrong)  we propose  inspired from the work
on Fuzzy Sets [22]  a soft measure based on the WUP score [23]  which we call WUPS (WUP
Set) score. As the number of classes grows  the semantic boundaries between them are becoming
more fuzzy. For example  both concepts ’carton’ and ’box’ have similar meaning  or ’cup’ and
(cid:80)N
’cup of coffee’ are almost indifferent. Therefore we seek a metric that measures the quality of an
answer and penalizes naive solutions where the architecture outputs too many or too few answers.
Standard Accuracy is deﬁned as: 1
i=1 1{Ai = T i} · 100 where Ai  T i are i-th answer and
N
ground-truth respectively. Since both the answers may include more than one object  it is beneﬁcial
to represent them as sets of the objects T = {t1  t2  ...}. From this point of view we have for every
i ∈ {1  2  ...  N}:
(cid:89)

We use a soft equivalent of the intersection operator in Eq. 3  and a set membership measure µ 
with properties µ(x ∈ X) = 1 if x ∈ X  µ(x ∈ X) = maxy∈X µ(x = y) and µ(x = y) ∈ [0  1] 
in Eq. 4 with equality whenever µ = 1. For µ we use a variant of Wu-Palmer similarity [23  24].
WUP(a  b) calculates similarity based on the depth of two words a and b in the taxonomy[25  26] 
and deﬁne the WUPS score:

Empirically  we have found that in our task a WUP score of around 0.9 is required for precise
answers. Therefore we have implemented down-weighting WUP(a  b) by one order of magnitude
(0.1 · WUP) whenever WUP(a  b) < t for a threshold t. We plot a curve over thresholds t ranging
from 0 to 1 (Figure 5). Since ”WUPS at 0” refers to the most ’forgivable’ measure without any down-
weighting and ”WUPS at 1.0” corresponds to plain accuracy. Figure 5 benchmarks architectures by
requiring answers with precision ranging from low to high. Here we show some examples of the pure
WUP score to give intuitions about the range: WUP(curtain  blinds) = 0.94  WUP(carton  box) =
0.94  WUP(stove  ﬁre extinguisher) = 0.82.
4.2 Quantitative results
We perform a series of experiments to highlight particular challenges like uncertain segmenta-
tions  unknown true logical forms  some linguistic phenomena as well as show the advantages of
our proposed multi-world approach.
In particular  we distinguish between experiments on syn-
thetic question-answer pairs (SynthQA) based on templates and those collected by annotators (Hu-
manQA)  automatic scene segmentation (AutoSeg) with a computer vision algorithm [15] and hu-
man segmentations (HumanSeg) based on the ground-truth annotations in the NYU dataset as well
as single world (single) and multi-world (multi) approaches.
4.2.1 Synthetic question-answer pairs (SynthQA)
Based on human segmentations (HumanSeg  37 classes) (1st and 2nd rows in Table 3) uses au-
tomatically generated questions (we use templates shown in Table 2) and human segmentations.
We have generated 20 training and 40 test question-answer pairs per template category  in total 140
training and 280 test pairs (as an exception negations type 1 and 2 have 10 training and 20 test exam-
ples each). This experiment shows how the architecture generalizes across similar type of questions
provided that we have human annotation of the image segments. We have further removed negations
of type 3 in the experiments as they have turned out to be particularly computationally demanding.
Performance increases hereby from 56% to 59.9% with about 80% training Accuracy. Since some
incorrect derivations give correct answers  the semantic parser learns wrong associations. Other dif-
ﬁculties stem from the limited training data and unseen object categories during training.
Based on automatic segmentations (AutoSeg  37 classes  single) (3rd row in Table 3) tests the ar-
chitecture based on uncertain facts obtained from automatic semantic segmentation [15] where the

6

most likely object labels are used to create a single world. Here  we are experiencing a severe drop
in performance from 59.9% to 11.25% by switching from human to automatic segmentation. Note
that there are only 37 classes available to us. This result suggests that the vision part is a serious
bottleneck of the whole architecture.
Based on automatic segmentations using multi-world approach (AutoSeg  37 classes  multi)
(4th row in Table 3) shows the beneﬁts of using our multiple worlds approach to predict the an-
swer. Here we recover part of the lost performance by an explicit treatment of the uncertainty in the
segmentations. Performance increases from 11.25% to 13.75%.
4.3 Human question-answer pairs (HumanQA)
Based on human segmentations 894 classes (HumanSeg  894 classes) (1st row in Table 4) switch-
ing to human generated question-answer pairs. The increase in complexity is twofold. First  the
human annotations exhibit more variations than the synthetic approach based on templates. Second 
the questions are typically longer and include more spatially related objects. Figure 4 shows a few
samples from our dataset that highlights challenges including complex and nested spatial reference
and use of reference frames. We yield an accuracy of 7.86% in this scenario. As argued above 
we also evaluate the experiments on the human data under the softer WUPS scores given different
thresholds (Table 4 and Figure 5). In order to put these numbers in perspective  we also show perfor-
mance numbers for two simple methods: predicting the most popular answer yields 4.4% Accuracy 
and our untrained architecture gives 0.18% and 1.3% Accuracy and WUPS (at 0.9).
Based on human segmentations 37 classes (HumanSeg  37 classes) (2nd row in Table 4) uses hu-
man segmentation and question-answer pairs. Since only 37 classes are supported by our automatic
segmentation algorithm  we run on a subset of the whole dataset. We choose the 25 test images
yielding a total of 286 question answer pairs for the following experiments. This yields 12.47% and
15.89% Accuracy and WUPS at 0.9 respectively.
Based on automatic segmentations (AutoSeg  37 classes) (3rd row in Table 4) Switching from the
human segmentations to the automatic yields again a drop from 12.47% to 9.69% in Accuracy and
we observe a similar trend for the whole spectrum of the WUPS scores.
Based on automatic segmentations using multi-world approach (AutoSeg  37 classes  multi)
(4th row in Table 4) Similar to the synthetic experiments our proposed multi-world approach yields
an improvement across all the measure that we investigate.
Human baseline (5th and 6th rows in Table 4 for 894 and 37 classes) shows human predictions on
our dataset. We ask independent annotators to provide answers on the questions we have collected.
They are instructed to answer with a number  basic colors [16]  or objects (from 37 or 894 cate-
gories) or set of those. This performance gives a practical upper bound for the question-answering
algorithms with an accuracy of 60.27% for the 37 class case and 50.20% for the 894 class case.
We also ask to compare the answers of the AutoSeg single world approach with HumanSeg single
world and AutoSeg multi-worlds methods. We use a two-sided binomial test to check if difference
in preferences is statistically signiﬁcant. As a result AutoSeg single world is the least preferred
method with the p-value below 0.01 in both cases. Hence the human preferences are aligned with
our accuracy measures in Table 4.
4.4 Qualitative results
We choose examples in Fig. 6 to illustrate different failure cases - including last example where all
methods fail. Since our multi-world approach generates different sets of facts about the perceived
worlds  we observe a trend towards a better representation of high level concepts like ’counting’
(leftmost the ﬁgure) as well as language associations. A substantial part of incorrect answers is
attributed to missing segments  e.g. no pillow detection in third example in Fig. 6.
5 Summary
We propose a system and a dataset for question answering about real-world scenes that is reminiscent
of a visual turing test. Despite the complexity in uncertain visual perception  language understanding
and program induction  our results indicate promising progress in this direction. We bring ideas
together from automatic scene analysis  semantic parsing with symbolic reasoning  and combine
them under a multi-world approach. As we have mature techniques in machine learning  computer
vision  natural language processing and deduction at our disposal  it seems timely to bring these
disciplines together on this open challenge.

QA: (what is beneath the candle holder  decorative plate)!Some annotators use variations on spatial relations that are similar  e.g. ‘beneath’ is closely related to ‘below’.!!QA: (what is in front of the wall divider?  cabinet) Annotators use additional properties to clarify object references (i.e. wall divider). Moreover  the perspective plays an important role in these spatial relations interpretations.QA1:(How many doors are in the image?  1)!QA2:(How many doors are in the image?  5)!Different interpretation of ‘door’ results in different counts: 1 door at the end of the hall  vs. 5 doors including lockers!QA: (what is behind the table?  sofa)!Spatial relations exhibit different reference frames. Some annotations use observer-centric  others object-centric view!QA: (how many lights are on?  6)!Moreover  some questions require detection of states ‘light on or off’ Q: what is at the back side of the sofas?!Annotators use wide range spatial relations  such as ‘backside’ which is object-centric.QA1: (what is in front of the curtain behind the armchair?  guitar)!!QA2: (what is in front of the curtain?  guitar)!!Spatial relations matter more in complex environments where reference resolution becomes more relevant. In cluttered scenes  pragmatism starts playing a more important roleThe annotators are using different names to call the same things. The names of the brown object near the bed include ‘night stand’  ‘stool’  and ‘cabinet’.Some objects  like the table on the left of image  are severely occluded or truncated. Yet  the annotators refer to them in the questions.QA: (What is behind the table?  window)!Spatial relation like ‘behind’ are dependent on the reference frame. Here the annotator uses observer-centric view.!QA: (How many drawers are there?  8)!The annotators use their common-sense knowledge for amodal completion. Here the annotator infers the 8th drawer from the contextQA: (What is the object on the counter in the corner?  microwave)!References like ‘corner’ are difﬁcult to resolve given current computer vision models. Yet such scene features are frequently used by humans.!QA: (How many doors are open?  1)!Notion of states of object (like open) is not well captured by current vision techniques. Annotators use such attributes frequently for disambiguation.!QA: (What is the shape of the green chair?  horse shaped)!In this example  an annotator refers to a “horse shaped chair” which requires a quite abstract reasoning about the shapes.!QA: (Where is oven?  on the right side of refrigerator)!On some occasions  the annotators prefer to use more complex responses. With spatial relations  we can increase the answer’s precision.!QA: (What is in front of toilet?  door)!Here the ‘open door’ to the restroom is not clearly visible  yet captured by the annotator.!●●●●●●●●●●●0.00.20.40.60.8ThresholdWUPS●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●HumanQA00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91HumanSeg  Single  894HumanSeg  Single  37AutoSeg  Single  37AutoSeg  Multi  37Human Baseline  894Human Baseline  37Q: What is on the right side of the table?!H: chair M: window  ﬂoor  wall!C: ﬂoorQ: How many red chairs are there?!H: ()!M: 6!C: blinds!!Q: How many chairs are at the table?!H: wall M: 4!C: chairQ: What is the object on the chair?!H: pillow!M: ﬂoor  wall!C: wallQ: What is on the right side of cabinet?!H: picture M: bed!C: bedQ: What is on the wall?!H: mirror!M: bed!C: pictureQ: What is behind the television?!H: lamp M: brown  pink  purple!C: pictureQ: What is in front of television?!H: pillow!M: chair!C: pictureReferences
