Abstract

We study the restless bandit associated with an extremely simple scalar Kalman
ﬁlter model in discrete time. Under certain assumptions  we prove that the prob-
lem is indexable in the sense that the Whittle index is a non-decreasing function of
the relevant belief state. In spite of the long history of this problem  this appears
to be the ﬁrst such proof. We use results about Schur-convexity and mechanical
words  which are particular binary strings intimately related to palindromes.

Introduction

We study the problem of monitoring several time series so as to maintain a precise belief while min-
imising the cost of sensing. Such problems can be viewed as POMDPs with belief-dependent re-
wards [3] and their applications include active sensing [7]  attention mechanisms for multiple-object
tracking [22]  as well as online summarisation of massive data from time-series [4]. Speciﬁcally  we
discuss the restless bandit [24] associated with the discrete-time Kalman ﬁlter [19]. Restless bandits
generalise bandit problems [6  8] to situations where the state of each arm (project  site or target)
continues to change even if the arm is not played. As with bandit problems  the states of the arms
evolve independently given the actions taken  suggesting that there might be efﬁcient algorithms for
large-scale settings  based on calculating an index for each arm  which is a real number associated
with the (belief-)state of that arm alone. However  while bandits always have an optimal index pol-
icy (select the arm with the largest index)  it is known that no index policy can be optimal for some
discrete-state restless bandits [17] and such problems are in general PSPACE-hard even to approxi-
mate to any non-trivial factor [10]. Further  in this paper we address restless bandits with real-valued
rather than discrete states. On the other hand  Whittle proposed a natural index policy for restless
bandits [24]  but this policy only makes sense when the restless bandit is indexable (Section 2).
Brieﬂy  a restless bandit is said to be indexable when an optimal solution to a relaxed version of the
problem consists in playing all arms whose indices exceed a given threshold. (The relaxed version
of the problem relaxes the constraint on the number of arms pulled per turn to a constraint on the
average number of arms pulled per turn). Under certain conditions  indexability implies a form of
asymptotic optimality of Whittle’s policy for the original problem [23  20].
Restless bandits associated with scalar Kalman(-Bucy) ﬁlters in continuous time were recently
shown to be indexable [12] and the corresponding discrete-time problem has attracted considerable
attention over a long period [15  11  16  21]. However  that attention has produced no satisfactory
proof of indexability – even for scalar time-series and even if we assume that there is a monotone
optimal policy for the single-arm problem  which is a policy that plays the arm if and only if the
relevant belief-state exceeds some threshold (here the relevant belief-state is a posterior variance).
Theorem 1 of this paper addresses that gap. After formalising the problem (Section 2)  we de-
scribe the concepts and intuition (Section 3) behind the main result (Section 4). The main tools
are mechanical words (which are not sufﬁciently well-known) and Schur convexity. As these tools
are associated with rather general theorems  we believe that future work (Section 5) should enable
substantial generalisation of our results.

2 Problem and Index

:= (Y1 t  . . .   YN t) Ht

We consider the problem of tracking N time-series  which we call arms  in discrete time. The state
Zi t ∈ R of arm i at time t ∈ Z+ evolves as a standard-normal random walk independent of every-
thing but its immediate past (Z+  R− and R+ all include zero). The action space is U := {1  . . .   N}.
Action ut = i makes an expensive observation Yi t of arm i which is normally-distributed about Zi t
with precision bi ∈ R+ and we receive cheap observations Yj t of each other arm j with precision
aj ∈ R+ where aj < bj and aj = 0 means no observation at all.
Let Zt  Yt Ht Ft be the state  observation  history and observed history  so that Zt
:= ((Z0  u0  Y0)  . . .   (Zt  ut  Yt)) and Ft
(Z1 t  . . .   ZN t)  Yt
((u0  Y0)  . . .   (ut  Yt)). Then we formalise the above as (1· is the indicator function)
1ut(cid:54)=i
Zi 0 ∼ N (0  1)  Zi t+1 | Ht ∼ N (Zi t  1)  Yi t | Ht−1  Zt  ut ∼ N
bi
Note that this setting is readily generalised to E[(Zi t+1 − Zi t)2] (cid:54)= 1 by a change of variables.
Thus the posterior belief is given by the Kalman ﬁlter as Zi t | Ft ∼ N ( ˆZi t  xi t) where the
posterior mean is ˆZi t ∈ R and the error variance xi t ∈ R+ satisﬁes
xi t+1 = φi 1ut+1=i(xi t) where φi 0(x) :=

Problem KF1. Let π be a policy so that ut = π(Ft−1). Let xπ
i t be the error variance under π. The
problem is to choose π so as to minimise the following objective for discount factor β ∈ [0  1). The
i t with weights wi ∈ R+ plus observation
objective consists of a weighted sum of error variances xπ

Single-Arm Problem and Whittle Index. Now ﬁx an arm i and write xπ

observations respectively and the expensive observation now costs h + ν where ν ∈ R. The single-
arm problem is to choose a policy  which here is an action sequence  π := (u0  u1  . . . )

For any ﬁxed x ∈ R+  the value of ν for which actions u0 = 0 and u0 = 1 are both optimal is
known as the Whittle index λW (x) assuming it exists and is unique. In other words

The Whittle index λW (x) is the solution to Q(x  0|λW (x)) = Q(x  1|λW (x)).

Let us consider a policy which takes action u0 = α then acts optimally producing actions uα∗

Whittle [24] recognised that for his index policy (play the arm with the largest λW (x)) to make
sense  any arm which receives an expensive observation for added cost ν  must also receive an
expensive observation for added cost ν(cid:48) < ν. Such problems are said to be indexable. The question
resolved by this paper is whether Problem KF1 is indexable. Equivalently  is λW (x) non-decreasing
in x ∈ R+?

We are now ready to describe the key concepts underlying this result.
Words. In this paper  a word w is a string on {0  1}∗ with kth letter wk and wi:j := wiwi+1 . . . wj.
The empty word is   the concatenation of words u  v is uv  the word that is the n-fold repetition
of w is wn  the inﬁnite repetition of w is wω and ˜w is the reverse of w  so w = ˜w means w is
a palindrome. The length of w is |w| and |w|u is the number of times that word u appears in w 
overlaps included.
Christoffel  Sturmian and Mechanical Words. It turns out that the action sequences in (5) are
given by such words  so the following deﬁnitions are central to this paper.

t (x) are given

The Christoffel tree (Figure 2) is an inﬁnite complete binary tree [5] in which each node is labelled
with a pair (u  v) of words. The root is (0  1) and the children of (u  v) are (u  uv) and (uv  v).
The Christoffel words are the words 0  1 and the concatenations uv for all (u  v) in that tree. The
fractions |uv|1/|uv|0 form the Stern-Brocot tree [9] which contains each positive rational number
exactly once. Also  inﬁnite paths in the Stern-Brocot tree converge to the positive irrational numbers.
Analogously  Sturmian words could be thought of as inﬁnitely-long Christoffel words.
Alternatively  among many known characterisations  the Christoffel words can be deﬁned as the
words 0  1 and the words 0w1 where a := |0w1|1/|0w1| and

(01w)n := (cid:98)(n + 1)a(cid:99) − (cid:98)na(cid:99)

for any relatively prime natural numbers |0w1|0 and |0w1|1 and for n = 1  2  . . .  |0w1|. The
Sturmian words are then the inﬁnite words 0w1w2 ··· where  for n = 1  2  . . . and a ∈ (0  1)\Q 

(01w1w2 ··· )n := (cid:98)(n + 1)a(cid:99) − (cid:98)na(cid:99).
We use the notation 0w1 for Sturmian words although they are inﬁnite.
The set of mechanical words is the union of the Christoffel and Sturmian words [13]. (Note that the
mechanical words are sometimes deﬁned in terms of inﬁnite repetitions of the Christoffel words.)
Majorisation. As in [14]  let x  y ∈ Rm and let x(i) and y(i) be their elements sorted in ascending
order. We say x is weakly supermajorised by y and write x ≺w y if

y(k)

for all j = 1  . . .   m.

k=1

k=1

x(k) ≥ j(cid:88)
j(cid:88)
x[k] ≤ j(cid:88)
j(cid:88)
f (xi) ≤ m(cid:88)

m(cid:88)

k=1

k=1

If this is an equality for j = m we say x is majorised by y and write x ≺ y. It turns out that

x ≺ y

⇔

for j = 1  . . .   m − 1 with equality for j = m

y[k]

where x[k]  y[k] are the sequences sorted in descending order. For x  y ∈ Rm we have [14]

x ≺ y

⇔

f (yi)

for all convex functions f : R → R.

i=1

i=1

More generally  a real-valued function φ deﬁned on a subset A of Rm is said to be Schur-convex on
A if x ≺ y implies that φ(x) ≤ φ(y).
M¨obius Transformations. Let µA(x) denote the M¨obius transformation µA(x) := A11x+A12
A21x+A22
where A ∈ R2×2. M¨obius transformations such as φ0(·)  φ1(·) are closed under composition  so
for any word w we deﬁne φw(x) := φw|w| ◦ ··· ◦ φw2 ◦ φw1 (x) and φ(x) := x.
Intuition. Here is the intuition behind our main result.
For any x ∈ R+  the orbits in (5) correspond to a particular mechanical word 0  1 or 0w1 depending
on the value of x (Figure 1). Speciﬁcally  for any word u  let yu be the ﬁxed point of the mapping φu
on R+ so that φu(yu) = yu and yu ∈ R+. Then the word corresponding to x is 1 for 0 ≤ x ≤ y1 
0w1 for x ∈ [y01w  y10w] and 0 for y0 ≤ x < ∞.
In passing we note that these ﬁxed points
are sorted in ascending order by the ratio ρ := |01w|0/|01w|1 of counts of 0s to counts of 1s  as

words (black circles) and the tree of φw(0) (blue).

illustrated by Figure 3. Interestingly  it turns out that ratio ρ is a piecewise-constant yet continuous
function of x  reminiscent of the Cantor function.
Also  composition of M¨obius transformations is homeomorphic to matrix multiplication so that

µA ◦ µB(x) = µAB(x)

for any A  B ∈ R2×2.

Thus  the index (6) can be written in terms of the orbits of a linear system (11) given by 0  1 or 0w1.
Further  if A ∈ R2×2 and det(A) = 1 then the gradient of the corresponding M¨obius transformation
is the convex function

dµA(x)

dx

=

1

(A21x + A22)2 .

So the gradient of the index is the difference of the sums of a convex function of the linear-system
orbits. However  such sums are Schur-convex functions and it follows that the index is increasing
because one orbit weakly supermajorises the other  as we now show for the case 0w1 (noting that
the proof is easier for words 0  1). As 0w1 is a mechanical word  w is a palindrome. Further  if w is
a palindrome  it turns out that the difference between the linear-system orbits increases with x. So 
we might deﬁne the majorisation point for w as the x for which one orbit majorises the other. Quite
remarkably  if w is a palindrome then the majorisation point is φw(0) (Proposition 7). Indeed the
black circles and blue dots of Figure 3 coincide. Finally  φw(0) is less than or equal to y01w which
is the least x for which the orbits correspond to the word 0w1. Indeed  the blue dots of Figure 3 are
below the corresponding black dots. Thus one orbit does indeed supermajorise the other.

4 Proof of Main Result

4.1 Mechanical Words
The M¨obius transformations of (1) satisfy the following assumption for I := R+. We prove that the
ﬁxed point yw of word w (the solution to φw(x) = x on I) is unique in the supplementary material.
Assumption A2. Functions φ0 : I → I  φ1 : I → I  where I is an interval of R  are increasing
and non-expansive  so for all x  y ∈ I : x < y and for k ∈ {0  1} we have

(cid:124)

φk(x) < φk(y)

increasing

(cid:123)(cid:122)

(cid:125)

and

φk(y) − φk(x) < y − x

.

(cid:124)

(cid:123)(cid:122)

non-expansive

(cid:125)

Furthermore  the ﬁxed points y0  y1 of φ0  φ1 on I satisfy y1 < y0.
Hence the following two propositions (supplementary material) apply to φ0  φ1 of (1) on I = R+.

|01w|0 / |01w|10.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.9y01w and ?w(0)020406080100Proposition 1. Suppose A2 holds  x ∈ I and w is a non-empty word. Then

x < φw(x) ⇔ φw(x) < yw ⇔ x < yw

and x > φw(x) ⇔ φw(x) > yw ⇔ x > yw.

For a given x  in the notation of (5)  we call the shortest word u such that (u1∗
2   . . . ) = uω
the x-threshold word. Proposition 2 generalises a recent result about x-threshold words in a setting
where φ0  φ1 are linear [18].
Proposition 2. Suppose A2 holds and 0w1 is a mechanical word. Then

1   u1∗

0w1 is the x-threshold word ⇔ x ∈ [y01w  y10w].

Also  if x0  x1 ∈ I with x0 ≥ y0 and x1 ≤ y1 then the x0- and x1-threshold words are 0 and 1.
We also use the following very interesting fact (Proposition 4.2 on p.28 of [5]).
Proposition 3. Suppose 0w1 is a mechanical word. Then w is a palindrome.

so that the M¨obius transformations µF   µG are the functions φ0  φ1 of (1) and GF −F G = (b−a)K.
Given any word w ∈ {0  1}∗  we deﬁne the matrix product M (w)

M (w) := M (w|w|)··· M (w1)  where M () := I  M (0) := F and M (1) := G

where I ∈ R2×2 is the identity and the preﬁx sum S(w) as the matrix polynomial

S(w) :=

M (w1:k) 

where S() := 0 (the all-zero matrix).

(7)

For any A ∈ R2×2  let tr(A) be the trace of A  let Aij = [A]ij be the entries of A and let A ≥ 0
indicate that all entries of A are non-negative.
Remark. Clearly  det(F ) = det(G) = 1 so that det(M (w)) = 1 for any word w. Also  S(w)
corresponds to the partial sums of the linear-system orbits  as hinted in the previous section.
The following proposition captures the role of palindromes (proof in the supplementary material).

for some f  h ∈ R 

2. tr(M (10p)) = tr(M (01p)) 
3. If u ∈ {p(10p)n  (10p)n10} then M (u) − M (˜u) = λK for some λ ∈ R− 
4. If w is a preﬁx of p then [M (p(10p)n10w)]22 ≤ [M (p(01p)n01w)]22 
5. [M ((10p)n10w)]21 ≥ [M ((01p)n01w)]21 
6. [M ((10p)n1)]21 ≥ [M ((01p)n0)]21.

We now demonstrate a surprisingly simple relation between S(w) and M (w).
Proposition 5. Suppose w is a palindrome. Then
and

S21(w) = M22(w) − 1

S22(w) = M12(w) + S21(w).

Furthermore  if ∆k := [S(10w)M (w(10w)k) − S(01w)M (w(01w)k)]22 then

∆k = 0

for all k ∈ Z+.

Proof. Let us write M := M (w)  S := S(w). We prove (8) by induction on |w|. In the base
case w ∈ {  0  1}. For w =   M22 − 1 = 0 = S21  M12 + S21 = 0 = S22. For w ∈ {0  1} 
M22 − 1 = c = S21  M12 + S21 = 1 + c = S22 for some c ∈ {a  b}. For the inductive step  in
accordance with Claim 1 of Proposition 4  assume w ∈ {0v0  1v1} for some word v satisfying
for some c  d  f  h ∈ R.

For w = 1v1  M := M (1v1) = GM (v)G and S := S(1v1) = GM (v)G+S(v)G+G. Calculating
the corresponding matrix products and sums gives

S21 = (bh + h + bf − 1)(bh + 2h + bf + f + 1)(h + f )−1 = M22 − 1

S22 − S21 = bh + 2h + bf + f = M12

as claimed. For w = 0u0 the claim also holds as F = G|b=a. This completes the proof of (8).
Furthermore Part. Let A := S(w)F G + F G + G and B := S(w)GF + GF + F . Then

by deﬁnition of S(·). By Claim 1 of Proposition 4 and (8) we know that

∆k = [(A(M (w)F G)k − B(M (w)GF )k)M (w)]22

for some c  d  f  h ∈ R.

Substituting these expressions and the deﬁnitions of F  G into the deﬁnitions of A  B and then
into (10) for k ∈ {0  1} directly gives ∆0 = ∆1 = 0 (although this calculation is long).
Now consider the case k ≥ 2. Claim 2 of Proposition 4 says tr(M (10w)) = tr(M (01w)) and clearly
det(M (10w)) = det(M (01w)) = 1. Thus we can diagonalise as

M (w)F G =: U DU−1  M (w)GF =: V DV −1  D := diag(λ  1/λ)

for some λ ≥ 1

so that ∆k = [AU DkU−1M (w) − eT BV DkV −1M (w)]22 =: γ1λk + γ2λ−k. So  if λ = 1 then
∆k = γ1 + γ2 = ∆0 and we already showed that ∆0 = 0. Otherwise λ (cid:54)= 1  so ∆0 = ∆1 = 0
implies γ1 + γ2 = γ1λ + γ2λ−1 = 0 which gives γ1 = γ2 = 0. Thus for any k ∈ Z+ we have
∆k = γ1λk + γ2λ−k = 0.

4.3 Majorisation

The following is a straightforward consequence of results in [14] proved in the supplementary ma-
terial. We emphasize that the notation ≺w has nothing to do with the notion of w as a word.

Proof. Clearly φw(0) ≥ 0 so x ≥ 0 and hence v(x) ≥ 0. So for any word u and letter c ∈ {0  1} we
have M (uc)v(x) = M (c)M (u)v(x) ≥ M (u)v(x) ≥ 0 as M (c) ≥ I. Thus xk+1(x) ≥ xk(x) ≥ 0

Indexability

4.4
Theorem 1. The index λW (x) of (6) is continuous and non-decreasing for x ∈ R+.

λ(x) := λW (x)(cid:12)(cid:12)w=1 h=0 and we can use w to denote a word. By Proposition 2  x ∈ [y01w  y10w]

Proof. As weight w is non-negative and cost h is a constant we only need to prove the result for
for some mechanical word 0w1. (Cases x /∈ (y1  y0) are clariﬁed in the supplementary material.)
Let us show that the hypotheses of Proposition 7 are satisﬁed by w and x. Firstly  w is a palindrome
by Proposition 3. Secondly  φw01(0) ≥ 0 and as φw(·) is monotonically increasing  it follows that
φw◦φw01(0) ≥ φw(0). Equivalently  φ01w◦φw(0) ≥ φw(0) so that φw(0) ≤ y01w by Proposition 1.
Hence x ≥ y01w ≥ φw(0).
Thus Proposition 7 applies  showing that the sequences σ(n)
y   with elements xnm+k(x) and
ynm+k(x) as deﬁned in (11)  are non-decreasing sequences on R+ with σ(n)
y . Also  1/x2
is a symmetric function that is convex and decreasing on R+. Therefore Proposition 6 applies giving

x ≺w σ(n)

Also Proposition 2 shows that

the x-threshold orbits are (φu1(x)  . . .   φu1:k (x)  . . . ) and

βk(1lk+1=1 − 1uk+1=1) =

But λ(x) is continuous for x ∈ R+ (as shown in the supplementary material). Therefore we con-
clude that λ(x) is non-decreasing for x ∈ R+.

5 Further Work

One might attempt to prove that assumption A1 holds using general results about monotone optimal
policies for two-action MDPs based on submodularity [2] or multimodularity [1]. However  we ﬁnd
counter-examples to the required submodularity condition. Rather  we are optimistic that the ideas
of this paper themselves offer an alternative approach to proving A1. It would then be natural to
extend our results to settings where the underlying state evolves as Zt+1 | Ht ∼ N (mZt  1) for
some multiplier m (cid:54)= 1 and to cost functions other than the variance. Finally  the question of the
indexability of the discrete-time Kalman ﬁlter in multiple dimensions remains open.
