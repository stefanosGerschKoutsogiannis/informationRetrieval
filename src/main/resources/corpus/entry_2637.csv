Abstract

Archived data from the US network of weather radars hold detailed information
about bird migration over the last 25 years  including very high-resolution partial
measurements of velocity. Historically  most of this spatial resolution is discarded
and velocities are summarized at a very small number of locations due to modeling
and algorithmic limitations. This paper presents a Gaussian process (GP) model
to reconstruct high-resolution full velocity ﬁelds across the entire US. The GP
faithfully models all aspects of the problem in a single joint framework  includ-
ing spatially random velocities  partial velocity measurements  station-speciﬁc
geometries  measurement noise  and an ambiguity known as aliasing. We develop
fast inference algorithms based on the FFT; to do so  we employ a creative use
of Laplace’s method to sidestep the fact that the kernel of the joint process is
non-stationary.

Introduction

Archived data from the US network of weather radars hold valuable information about atmospheric
phenomona across the US for over 25 years [1]. Although these radars were designed to monitor
weather  they also detect ﬂying animals such as birds  bats  and insects [2]. The information
contained in the archive is critical to understanding phenomena ranging from extreme weather to bird
migration [3–5].
This paper is concerned with using radar to measure velocity  with the primary goal of gathering
detailed information about bird migration. Radar is the most comprehensive source of information
about this difﬁcult-to-study phenomenon [5–8]  but  historically  most information has gone largely
unused due to the sheer size of the data and the difﬁculty of interpreting it automatically. Recently 
analytical advances including machine learning [9  10] are enabling scientists to begin to conduct
larger scale studies [5  7  11]. Radar measurements of bird migration density  direction  and speed
are important for understanding the biology of bird migration and to guide conservation [11–15].
Machine learning methods to automate the detailed interpretation of radar data will allow scientists to
answer questions at the scale of the entire continent and over more than two decades.
Doppler radars measure the rate at which objects approach or depart the radar  which gives partial
information about their velocity. By making certain smoothness assumptions  it is possible to
reconstruct full velocity vectors [9  16]. However  current methods are limited by rigid smoothness
assumptions and summarize all velocity information down to 143 points across the US (the locations
of the radar stations) even though the original data has on the order of half a billion measurements for
one nationwide snapshot.
The goal of this paper is to develop a comprehensive  principled  probabilistic model  together with
fast algorithms  to reconstruct spatially detailed velocity ﬁelds across the US. There are three critical
challenges. First  radars only measure radial velocity  the component of velocity in the direction of

32nd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2018)  Montréal  Canada.

the radar beam  so the full velocity is underdetermined. Second  the measured radial velocity may be
aliased  which means it is only known up to an additive constant. Third  measurements are tied to
station-speciﬁc geometry  so it is not clear how to combine data from many stations  for example
to ﬁll in gaps in coverage between stations (e.g.  see Figure 1(d)). Prior research has primarily
addressed these challenges separately  and has been unable to combine information from many radars
to reconstruct detailed velocity ﬁelds.
Our ﬁrst contribution is a joint Gaussian process (GP) to simultaneously model the radial velocity
measurements from all radar stations. While it is natural to model the velocity ﬁeld itself as a GP 
it is not obvious how to model the collection of all station-speciﬁc measurements as a GP. We start
by positing a GP on latent velocity vectors  and then derive a GP on the measurements such that the
station-speciﬁc geometry is encoded in the kernel function.
Our second contribution is a suite of fast algorithms for inference in this GP  which allows it to
scale to very large data sets. We leverage fast FFT-based algorithms for GP kernel operations for
points on a regular grid [17–19]. However  these require a stationary kernel  which due to the
station-speciﬁc geometry  ours is not. We show how to achieve the same speed beneﬁts by using
Laplace’s method (for exact inference) so that fast kernel operations can be performed in the space
of latent velocities  where the kernel is stationary. Finally  we show how to model aliasing directly
within the GP framework by employing a wrapped normal likelihood [9  20]; this ﬁts seamlessly into
our fast approach using Laplace’s method.
The result is a ﬁrst-of-its-kind probabilistic model that jointly models all aspects of the data generation
and measurement process; it accepts as input the raw radial velocity measurements  and outputs
smooth reconstructed velocity ﬁelds.

2 Background and Problem Deﬁnition

Radar Basics. The US network of weather radars  known as “NEXRAD” radars  consists of 143
radars in the continental US. Each conducts a volume scan or scan every 6 to 10 minutes  during
which is rotates its antenna 360 degrees around a ﬁxed vertical axis (one “sweep”) at increasing
elevation angles. The result of one scan is a set of raster data products in three-dimensional polar
coordinates corresponding to this scanning strategy. One measurement corresponds to a particular
antenna position (azimuth and elevation angle) and range; the corresponding volume of atmosphere
at this position in the polar grid is called a sample volume.
NEXRAD radars collect up to six different data products. For our purposes the most important
are reﬂectivity and radial velocity. Reﬂectivity measures the density of objects  speciﬁcally  the
total cross-sectional area of objects in a sample volume that reﬂect radio waves back to the radar.
Radial velocity is the rate at which objects in a sample volume approach or depart the radar  which is
measured by analyzing the frequency shift of reﬂected radio waves (the “Doppler effect”). Radial
velocity is illustrated in Figure 1(a). For any given sample volume  radial velocity gives only partial
velocity information: the projection of the actual velocity onto a unit vector in the direction of the
radar beam. However  if the actual velocity ﬁeld is smooth  we can often make good inferences
about the full velocity. Figure 1(b) shows example radial velocity information measured from the
KBGM radar in Binghamton  NY on the night of September 11  2010  during which there was heavy
bird migration. Objects approaching the radar have negative radial velocities (green)  and objects
departing the radar have positive radial velocities (red). We can infer from the overall pattern that
objects (in this case  migrating birds) are moving relatively uniformly from northeast to southwest.
Velocity Model. To make inferences of the type in Figure 1(b) we need to simultaneously rea-
son about spatial properties of the velocity ﬁeld and the measurement geometry. To set up this
type of analysis  for the ith sample volume within the domain of one radar station  let ai be
the unit vector in the direction from the radar station to the sample volume. This is given by
ai = (cos φi cos ρi  sin φi cos ρi  sin ρi) where φi and ρi are the azimuth and elevation angles  re-
spectively. Let zi = (ui  vi  wi) be the actual  unobserved  velocity vector. Then the radial velocity
i zi + i. Here  i ∼ N (0  σ2) is zero-mean
is aT
Gaussian noise that plays the dual role of modeling measurement error and deviations from whatever
prior model is chosen for the set of all zi. For example  in the uniform velocity model [16]  velocities
are assumed to be constant-valued within ﬁxed height bins above ground level within the domain of

i zi  and the measured radial velocity is yi = aT

one radar station  which is a very rigid uniformity assumption. Reported values for the noise standard
deviation are σ ∈ [2  6] ms−1 for birds  and σ < 2 ms−1 for precipitation [7].
Aliasing. Aliasing complicates the interpretation of radial velocity data. Due to the sampling
frequency of the radars  radial velocities can only be resolved up to the Nyquist velocity Vmax  which
depends on the operating mode of the radar. If the magnitude of the true radial velocity ri = aT
i zi
exceeds Vmax  then the measurement will be aliased. The aliasing operation is mathematically
equivalent to the modulus operation: for any real number r  deﬁne the aliased measurement of r
to be ¯r := r mod 2Vmax  with the convention that ¯r lies in the interval [−Vmax  Vmax] instead of
[0  2Vmax]. The values ¯r + 2kVmax  k ∈ N will all result in the same aliased measurement  and
are called aliases. Effectively  this means that radial velocities will “wrap around” at ±Vmax. For
example  Figure 1(c) shows the same data as Figure 1(b)  but before aliasing errors have been
corrected. In this example Vmax = 11ms−1. We see that that fastest approaching birds in the
northeast quadrant appear to be departing (red)  instead of approaching (dark green).
Multiple Radar Stations. The interpretation of radial velocity is station-speciﬁc. Figure 1(d) shows
a nationwide mosaic of radial velocity from individual stations  overlaid by a velocity ﬁeld. The
mosaic is very difﬁcult to interpret  due to abrupt changes at the boundaries between station coverage
areas. Thus  although we are very accustomed to seeing nationwide composites of radar reﬂectivity 
radial velocity data is not presented or analyzed in this way. This is the main problem we seek to
remedy in this work  by reconstructing velocity ﬁelds of the type overlaid on Figure 1(d).
Related Work. The uniform velocity model [16]  described above  makes a strong spatial unformity
assumption to reconstruct velocities at different heights in the immediate vicinity of one radar station.
Variants of this method are known as velocity volume proﬁling (VVP) or velocity-azimuthal display
(VAD). The uniformity assumptions prevent these algorithms from reconstructing spatially varying
velocity ﬁelds or combining information from multiple radars. Multi-Doppler methods combine

of their domains [16  21  22]. No spatial smoothness assumptions are made. Full velocity ﬁelds can
be reconstructed  but only within the overlap of radar domains. Dealiasing is the process of correcting
aliasing errors to guess the true radial velocity  usually by making smoothness assumptions or using
some external information [23]. Almost all previous work treats the different analytical challenges
(reconstruction from spatial cues  multiple stations  dealiasing) separately; a few methods combine
dealiasing with VVP or multi-Doppler methods [9  24  25]. Our method extends all of these methods
into a single  elegant  joint probabilistic model.

3 Modeling Latent Velocities

In this section  we present our joint probabilistic model for radial velocity measurements and latent
velocities. We begin by considering the problem in the absence of aliasing  and come back to it in
Section 4.
Likelihood in the absence of aliasing. Let Oi be the set of stations that measure radial velocities
at location xi. The likelihood of a single radial velocity measurement yij  in the absence of aliasing 
given the latent velocity zi and the radial axis aij  is Gaussian around the perfect radial velocity
measurement of the ground-truth latent velocity

p(yij|zi; xi) = N (yij; aT

ijzi  σ2).

(1)

The observed radial velocity measurements are conditionally independent given the latent velocities 
so the joint likelihood factorizes completely

p(y|z; x) =

p(yij|zi; xi) =

N (yij; aT

GP prior. We model the latent velocity ﬁeld as a vector-valued GP. The GP prior has a zero-valued
mean function and a modiﬁed squared exponential kernel. Since the GP is vector-valued  the output
of the kernel function is a 3 × 3 matrix of the following form.

The hyperparameters θ = [α  β] are the length scales which control the uniformity of the latent
velocity ﬁeld.

Covariance between measurements. Our approach to inferring the latent velocities relies on
the ability to jointly model the radial velocity measurements with the latent velocities. In order
to accomplish this  we need to have a covariance function relating radial velocity measurements.
Intuitively this seems problematic  since the radial velocity measurements not only depend on the
location of the measurement  but also the location of the station making the measurement. As it turns
out  applying deﬁnitions and the process by which radial velocity measurements are made gives the
following elegant covariance function.

Cov(yij  yi(cid:48)j(cid:48)) = E[yijyi(cid:48)j(cid:48)] = aT

Observe that this covariance function is not stationary  since it relies on the locations of the stations
from which the measurements were made.

Joint modeling measurements and latent velocities. The joint probability distribution between
the radial velocity measurements and the latent velocities is

p(y  z; x) = p(y|z; x)p(z; x).

(5)

Since both the likelihood and prior are Gaussian  the joint is also Gaussian. All we need to do to
fully specify the joint distribution is to solve for the ﬁrst two moments of the joint. The joint mean is

clearly zero. Let qT = [zT yT ]  let A = diag(cid:0)(cid:8)aT

Naive Exact Inference. Given this joint distribution  we can perform exact inference via Gaussian
conditioning. The posterior mean is

We can also predict directly at locations ˜z other than those where measurements were made using the
cross-covariance matrix ˜K between the locations where measurements were made and prediction
locations:

This method of inference is not scalable since it has cubic time complexity and quadratic space
complexity in the number of measurements.

E[˜z|y; x] = ˜KAT (AKAT + σ2I)−1y.

4 Efﬁcient Inference

In this section  we discuss how we can perform efﬁcient exact inference despite the lack of a stationary
kernel.

4.1 Laplace’s Method for Exact Inference

In order to make inference tractable  we would like to use fast FFT-based methods such as SKI
and KISS-GP [18]  but unfortunately these methods require the kernel to be stationary. To over-
come having a non-stationary kernel  we apply Laplace’s method [26]. This is conventionally for
approximate inference when the likelihood is not Gaussian  but we use it to be able to utilize fast
kernel operations for the latent GP  which is stationary  and the method will still be exact. Laplace’s
method replaces one-shot matrix inversion based inference with an iterative algorithm where the most
complicated operation is kernel-vector multiplication. If we pick locations to observe radial velocity
measurements on a grid Ω  we can perform the matrix-vector multiplication Ks  for an arbitrary
vector s  in O(n log n) time  where n = |Ω|.
The exact inference procedure we employ is presented in Algorithm 1. Laplace’s method iteratively
optimizes log p(z|y; x) by optimizing the second-order Taylor expansion around the current iterate
of z via an auxiliary variable ν = K−1z. Let l(z) = log p(z|y; x) be the log likelihood function 
∇l(z) be the gradient of the log likelihood  and W = −∇2l(z) be the negative Hessian. The most
challenging operation to make efﬁcient is Line 6 of Algorithm 1. We use the conjugate gradient
method to iteratively compute γ. The upshot is that we only need to be able to efﬁciently compute

5

W −1  multiply W −1 times arbitrary vectors  and multiply K times arbitrary vectors. W is block
diagonal with 3 × 3 blocks  which makes for linear time matrix-vector multiplication and inversion.
The only other bottleneck for both speed and storage is the kernel matrix.

4.2 Using Grid Structure for Fast Matrix-Vector Multiplication

In this section  we detail how we can perform efﬁcient kernel-vector multiplication by exploiting the
special structure of the kernel matrix following techniques presented by Wilson [27]. To accomplish
this we need to choose the measurements to use as observations from an evenly spaced grid. In most
cases  we will not have measurements for all grid points  so we use pseudo-observations to enable the
use of grid-based methods.

4.2.1 Missing Observations

Given Ω to be the set of grid locations where we would like to have radial velocity measurements  let
ˆΩ and ˜Ω be the locations where we have and do not have radial velocity measurements  respectively.
For all grid locations xi ∈ ˜Ω  we sample a pseudo radial velocity measurement yi ∼ N (0  −1)  for
some small . This implies the following joint log likelihood:

4.2.2 Kronecker-Toeplitz Structure

The latent GP can be decomposed into three independent GP’s – namely  over the u  v  and w
components of the latent velocities  respectively. Let Ku  Kv  and Kw be kernel matrices for each
of these GP’s  respectively  and all have shape n × n. When performing the multiplication Ks  we
decompose s into it’s u  v  and w component sub-vectors denoted su  sv  and sw  respectively. Then 
we perform each of the multiplications Kusu  Kvsv  and Kwsw  and recombine the results to get
Ks. All of these three multiplications are similar since Ku  Kv  and Kw all have the same structure.
We use Ku as an example and follow the method proposed by Wilson [27]. Kv and Kw follow the
same form. Ku decomposes into the Kronecker product Ku 1 ⊗ Ku 2 ⊗ Ku 3  where Ku 1  Ku 2 
and Ku 3 are all Toeplitz  since Ku is stationary. Ku 1 has shape n1 × n1  Ku 2 has shape n2 × n2 
and Ku 3 has shape n3 × n3 where n1  n2  and n3 are the dimensions of the grid  respectively.
Hence  n = n1n2n3. Let Su be the n1 × n2 × n3 tensor formed by reshaping su to match the grid
dimensions. Then

Here  the operation T ×i Mi denotes the i-mode product of the tensor T ∈ Rn1×n2×n3 and matrix
Mi ∈ Rni×ni. The result is another tensor T(cid:48) with the same dimensions. It is computed by ﬁrst
j(cid:54)=i nj  then computing the matrix product MiT(i) 
and ﬁnally reshaping the result back into an n1 × n2 × n3 tensor — see [28] for details. In our case 
since each matrix multiplication is between a Toeplitz matrix Ku i and a matrix T(i) with n entries 
it can be done in O(n log n) time using the FFT [29]. Therefore  the overall running time is also
O(n log n).

4.3 Handling Aliased Data

In this section  we extend our model to handle aliased radial velocity measurements. Recall that
aliasing means that radial velocities are only known up to an additive multiple of twice the Nyquist
velocity Vmax  which varies by operating mode of the radar. Conditions favorable for bird migration
often correspond to low values of Vmax and exacerbate aliasing problems.
To accommodate aliasing  we change the likelihood to model the aliasing process using a wrapped
normal likelihood [20]:

p(yij|zi; xi) = Nw(yij|aT

ijzi  σ2) =

6

N (yij + 2kVmax j; aT

(11)

This is simply the marginal density of all aliases of yij. The inﬁnite sum cannot be computed
analytically  so we approximate it with a ﬁnite number of aliases  (cid:96)   which is known to perform
well [9  30  31].

w(yij|aT

ijzi  σ2) =

N (yij − aT

(12)

Recall that ¯r aliases r to the interval [−Vmax  Vmax]  so the sum on the right-hand side is over the
2(cid:96) + 1 aliases of yij that are closest to the predicted value aT
ijzi. Since our efﬁcient inference method
only relies on the likelihood only through its gradient and Hessian  we can simply plug these new
functions into the algorithm presented in Algorithm 1. Observe that this likelihood is no longer
Gaussian  and thus we are no longer performing exact inference using Laplace’s method.

5 Experiments

In this section  we present the results from experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the method we
presented in the previous section. The ﬁrst two experiments analyze data scans from 13 radar stations
from the northeast US on the night of September 11  2010. In all experiments  hyperparameters are
ﬁxed at values chosen through preliminary experiments to match the expected smoothness of the
data  so that the RMSE between inferred radial velocities and raw measurements match values from
velocity models used in prior research [7  9].

Comparison of inference methods. First  we compare our fast inference method against the naive
inference method. In our experiments we ﬁrst resample data from all radar stations onto a ﬁxed
resolution grid. Each grid point has zero or more observations from different radar stations. The naive
method operates only on the actual observations m  and its running time is O(m3). Our grid-based
method operates on all n grid points  and its per-iteration running time is O(n log n). To tractably
perform naive inference we must subsample the m observations even further. We consider a range of
different sizes both for the base grid and the subsampled data set for the naive method.
Figure 2 shows the time vs. error for six different methods. The data set consists of radar scans
from 13 radar stations from the northeast US on the night of September 11  2010  and  for this
test  is preprocessed to eliminate aliasing errors [9]. Error is measured by ﬁrst inferring the full
velocity vector for each observation and then projecting it using the station-speciﬁc geometry to
compute the RMSE between the predicted and observed radial velocities. To fairly compare RMSE
values across the six methods  the naive method must predict values for all observations  not just its
subsample. To do this  we use the method presented in Equation 9. Each method was run on six
different three-dimensional grids with total sizes ranging from 51 200 to 219 700 grid points. We
compare our fast inference method against ﬁve different subsample sizes for the naive method. Every
experiment was run 10 times and the average time and RMSE is reported in Figure 2.
The grid-based Laplace’s method vastly outperforms the naive method. Not only does the naive
method get slower with an increase in grid size  but it also starts to perform worse  since it has to
make predictions at a ﬁner resolution from the same number of subsampled observations. Note that
the naive method is also making predictions at roughly an order of magnitude fewer locations than
the fast method because there are many grid points with zero observations.

Comparison of likelihood functions. Next  we show in Figure 4 the importance of the wrapped
normal likelihood when dealing with aliased data. We use the raw radial velocity data from 13 radar
stations in the northeast US from the night of September 11  2010. Figure 4(a) shows the inferred
velocity ﬁeld using our method with the Gaussian likelihood and Figure 4(b) shows the inferred
velocity ﬁeld using our method with the wrapped normal likelihood. Observe the region of the
velocity ﬁeld highlighted by the rectangle. The inference method with Gaussian likelihood fails to
infer a reasonable velocity ﬁeld in the presence of heavily aliased radial velocity measurements and
has a substantially higher RMSE1 than the method with the wrapped normal likelihood. The latter
model correctly infers from raw aliased radial velocities that the birds over those stations are ﬂying in
the same general direction as birds over nearby stations.

1For aliased data  RMSE is measured between the observed value and the closest alias of the predicted value.

Scaling to the continental US. A unique aspect of our method is that it can  for the ﬁrst time 
assimilate data from all radar stations to reconstruct spatially detailed velocity ﬁelds across the whole
US. An example is shown in Figure 1(d)  which depicts northward bird migration on the night of
May 2  2015. The grid size is 240 × 120 × 10; only the lowest elevation and every 5th velocity
measurement is plotted. The reconstructed velocities can be combined with reﬂectivity data as
shown in Figure 3 to observe both the density and velocity of migration. Future work can conduct
quantitative analyses of migration biology using these measurements.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

We presented the ﬁrst comprehensive solution to the problem of inferring latent velocities from
radial velocity measurements from weather radar stations across the US. Our end-to-end method
probabilistic model begins with raw radial velocity from many radar stations  and outputs valuable
information about migration patterns of birds at scale. We presented a novel method to perform fast
grid-based posterior inference even though our GP does not have a stationary kernel. The results
of our methods can be used by ecologists to expand human knowledge about bird movements to
advance conservation efforts and science.
Our current method is most suited to smooth velocity ﬁelds  such as those that occur during bird
migration. A promising line of future work is to extend our techniques to infer wind velocity ﬁelds by
measuring velocity of precipitation and wind-borne particles. We anticipate that our GP methodology

8

can also apply to this domain  but we will need to experiment with different kernels better suited to
these velocity ﬁelds  which can be much more complex.
