Abstract

We introduce a new Bayesian admixture model intended for exploratory analy-
sis of communication networks—speciﬁcally  the discovery and visualization of
topic-speciﬁc subnetworks in email data sets. Our model produces principled vi-
sualizations of email networks  i.e.  visualizations that have precise mathematical
interpretations in terms of our model and its relationship to the observed data.
We validate our modeling assumptions by demonstrating that our model achieves
better link prediction performance than three state-of-the-art network models and
exhibits topic coherence comparable to that of latent Dirichlet allocation. We
showcase our model’s ability to discover and visualize topic-speciﬁc communica-
tion patterns using a new email data set: the New Hanover County email network.
We provide an extensive analysis of these communication patterns  leading us to
recommend our model for any exploratory analysis of email networks or other
similarly-structured communication data. Finally  we advocate for principled vi-
sualization as a primary objective in the development of new network models.

Introduction

The structures of organizational communication networks are critical to collaborative problem solv-
ing [1]. Although it is seldom possible for researchers to directly observe complete organizational
communication networks  email data sets provide one means by which they can at least partially ob-
serve and reason about them. As a result—and especially in light of their rich textual detail  existing
infrastructure  and widespread usage—email data sets hold the potential to answer many impor-
tant scientiﬁc and practical questions within the organizational and social sciences. While some
questions may be answered by studying the structure of an email network as a whole  other  more
nuanced  questions can only be answered at ﬁner levels of granularity—speciﬁcally  by studying
topic-speciﬁc subnetworks. For example  breaks in communication (or duplicated communication)
about particular topics may indicate a need for some form of organizational restructuring. In order to
facilitate the study of these kinds of questions  we present a new Bayesian admixture model intended
for discovering and summarizing topic-speciﬁc communication subnetworks in email data sets.
There are a number of probabilistic models that incorporate both network and text data. Although
some of these models are speciﬁcally for email networks (e.g.  McCallum et al.’s author–recipient–
topic model [2])  most are intended for networks of documents  such as web pages and the links
between them [3] or academic papers and their citations [4]. In contrast  an email network is more
naturally viewed as a network of actors exchanging documents  i.e.  actors are associated with nodes
while documents are associated with edges. In other words  an email network deﬁnes a multinetwork
in which there may be multiple edges (one per email) between any pair of actors. Perhaps more
importantly  much of the recent work on modeling networks and text has focused on tasks such as

predicting links or detecting communities. Instead  we take a complementary approach and focus on
exploratory analysis. Speciﬁcally  our goal is to discover and visualize topic-speciﬁc subnetworks.
Rather than taking a two-stage approach in which subnetworks are discovered using one model and
visualized using another  we present a single probabilistic model that partitions an observed email
network into topic-speciﬁc subnetworks while simultaneously producing a visual representation of
each subnetwork. If network modeling and visualization are undertaken separately  the resultant vi-
sualizations may not directly reﬂect the model and its relationship to the observed data. Rather  these
visualizations provide a view of the model and the data seen through the lens of the visualization
algorithm and its associated assumptions  so any conclusions drawn from such visualizations can be
biased by artifacts of the visualization algorithm. Producing principled visualizations of networks 
i.e.  visualizations that have precise interpretations in terms of an associated network model and its
relationship to the observed data  remains an open challenge in statistical network modeling [5].
Addressing this open challenge was a primary objective in the development of our new model.
In order to discover and visualize topic-speciﬁc subnetworks  our model must associate each author–
recipient edge in the observed email network with a topic  as shown in Figure 1. Our model draws
upon ideas from latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [6] to identify a set of corpus-wide topics of
communication  as well as the subset of topics that best describe each observed email. We model
network structure using an approach similar to that of Hoff et al.’s latent space model (LSM) [7] so
as to facilitate visualization. Given an observed network  LSM associates each actor in the network
with a point in K-dimensional Euclidean space. For any pair of actors  the smaller the distance
between their points  the more likely they are to interact. If K = 2 or K = 3  these interaction
probabilities  collectively known as a “communication pattern”  can be directly visualized in 2- or
3-dimensional space via the locations of the actor-speciﬁc points. Our model extends this idea by
associating a K-dimensional Euclidean space with each topic. Observed author–recipient edges are
explicitly associated with topics via the K-dimensional topic-speciﬁc communication patterns.
In the next section  we present the mathematical details of our new model and outline a correspond-
ing inference algorithm. We then introduce a new email data set: the New Hanover County (NHC)
email network. Although our model is intended for exploratory analysis  we test our modeling as-
sumptions via three validation tasks. In Section 4.1  we show that our model achieves better link
prediction performance than three state-of-the-art network models. We also demonstrate that our
model is capable of inferring topics that are as coherent as those inferred using LDA. Together 
these experiments indicate that our model is an appropriate model of network structure and that
modeling this structure does not compromise topic quality. As a ﬁnal validation experiment  we
show that synthetic data generated using our model possesses similar network statistics to those of
the NHC email network. In Section 4.4  we showcase our model’s ability to discover and visualize
topic-speciﬁc communication patterns using the NHC network. We give an extensive analysis of
these communication patterns and demonstrate that they provide accessible visualizations of email-
based collaboration while possessing precise  meaningful interpretations within the mathematical
framework of our model. These ﬁndings lead us to recommend our model for any exploratory anal-
ysis of email networks or other similarly-structured communication data. Finally  we advocate for
principled visualization as a primary objective in the development of new network models.

2 Topic-Partitioned Multinetwork Embeddings

In this section  we present our new probabilistic generative model (and associated inference algo-
rithm) for communication networks. For concreteness  we frame our discussion of this model in

r = 0 if r = a(d)). Given a real-world email data set D = {{w(d)  a(d)  y(d)}}D

terms of email data  although it is generally applicable to any similarly-structured communication
data. The generative process and graphical model are provided in the supplementary materials.
A single email  indexed by d  is represented by a set of tokens w(d) = {w(d)
n=1 that comprise the
text of that email  an integer a(d) ∈ {1  ...  A} indicating the identity of that email’s author  and a
set of binary variables y(d) = {y(d)
r=1 indicating whether each of the A actors in the network is
a recipient of that email. For simplicity  we assume that authors do not send emails to themselves
(i.e.  y(d)
d=1  our
model permits inference of the topics expressed in the text of the emails  a set of topic-speciﬁc
K-dimensional embeddings (i.e.  points in K-dimensional Euclidean space) of the A actors in the
network  and a partition of the full communication network into a set of topic-speciﬁc subnetworks.
As in LDA [6]  a “topic” t is characterized by a discrete distribution over V word types with prob-
ability vector φ(t). A symmetric Dirichlet prior with concentration parameter β is placed over
Φ = {φ(1)  ...  φ(T )}. To capture the relationship between the topics expressed in an email and
that email’s recipients  each topic t is also associated with a “communication pattern”: an A × A
matrix of probabilities P (t). Given an email about topic t  authored by actor a  element p(t)
ar is the
probability of actor a including actor r as a recipient of that email. Inspired by LSM [7]  each com-
munication pattern P (t) is represented implicitly via a set of A points in K-dimensional Euclidean
r (cid:107))
space S(t) = {s(t)
with s(t)
2).1 If K = 2 or K = 3  this representation enables
each topic-speciﬁc communication pattern to be visualized in 2- or 3-dimensional space via the lo-
cations of the points associated with the A actors. It is worth noting that the dimensions of each
K-dimensional space have no inherent meaning. In isolation  each point s(t)
a conveys no informa-
tion; however  the distance between any two points has a precise and meaningful interpretation in the
generative process. Speciﬁcally  the recipients of any email associated with topic t are more likely
to be those actors near to the email’s author in the Euclidean space corresponding to that topic.

Each email  indexed by d  has a discrete distribution over topics θ(d). A symmetric Dirichlet prior
with concentration parameter α is placed over Θ = {θ(1)  ...  θ(D)}. Each token w(d)
n is associated
with a topic assignment z(d)
n = t. Our model does
not include a distribution over authors; the generative process is conditioned upon their identities.
The email-speciﬁc binary variables y(d) = {y(d)
r=1 indicate the recipients of email d and thus the
presence (or absence) of email-speciﬁc edges from author a(d) to each of the A − 1 other actors.
Consequently  there may be multiple edges (one per email) between any pair of actors  and D deﬁnes
a multinetwork over the entire set of actors. We assume that the complete multinetwork comprises T
topic-speciﬁc subnetworks. In other words  each y(d)
is associated with some topic t and therefore
with topic-speciﬁc communication pattern P (t) such that y(d)
ar ) for a(d) = a. A natural
way to associate each y(d)
r with a topic would be to draw a topic assignment from θ(d) in a manner
analogous to the generation of z(d)
n ; however  as outlined by Blei and Jordan [8]  this approach can
result in the undesirable scenario in which one subset of topics is associated with tokens  while an-
other (disjoint) subset is associated with edges. Additionally  models of annotated data that possess
this exchangeable structure tend to exhibit poor generalization [3  8]. A better approach  advocated
by Blei and Jordan  is to draw a topic assignment for each y(d)
from the empirical distribution over
topics deﬁned by z(d). By deﬁnition  the set of topics associated with edges will therefore be a sub-
set of the topics associated with tokens. One way of simulating this generative process is to associate
each y(d)
n at
that position2 by drawing a position assignment x(d)
. This
indirect procedure ensures that y(d)

r ∼ U(1  . . .   max (1  N (d))) for each y(d)

3 Data

Due to a variety of factors involving personal privacy concerns and the ownership of content by
email service providers  academic researchers rarely have access to organizational email data. For
example  the Enron data set [10]—arguably the most widely studied email data set—was only re-
leased because of a court order. The public record is an alternative source of organizational email
data. Public record data sets are widely available and can be continually updated  yet remain rel-
atively untapped by the academic community. We therefore introduce and analyze a new public
record email data set relevant to researchers in the organizational and social sciences as well as ma-
chine learning researchers. This data set consists of emails between the managers of the departments
that constitute the executive arm of government at the county level for New Hanover County  North
Carolina. In this semi-autonomous local government  county managers act as executives  and the in-
dividual departments are synonymous with the individual departments and agencies in  for instance 
the U.S. federal government. Therefore  not only does this email data set offer a view into the com-
munication patterns of the managers of New Hanover County  but analyses of it also serve as case
studies in modeling inter-agency communications in the U.S. federal government administration.

The New Hanover County (NHC) email network comprises the complete inboxes and outboxes of
30 department managers from the month of February  2011. In total  there are 30 909 emails  of
which 8 097 were authored by managers. Of these 8 097 emails  1 739 were sent to other managers
(via the “To” or “Cc” ﬁelds)  excluding any emails sent from a manager to him- or herself only.
For our experiments  we used these 1 739 emails between 30 actors. To verify that our model is
applicable beyond the NHC email network  we also performed two validation experiments using
the Enron email data set
[10]. For this data set  we treated each unique @enron email address
as an actor and used only those emails between the 50 most active actors (determined by the total
numbers of emails sent and received). Emails that were not sent to at least one other active actor (via
the “To” or “Cc” ﬁelds) were discarded. To avoid duplicate emails  we retained only those emails
from “ sent mail”  “sent”  or “sent items” folders. These steps resulted in a total of 8 322 emails
involving 50 actors. Both data sets were preprocessed to concatenate the text of subject lines and
message bodies and to remove any stop words  URLs  quoted text  and (where possible) signatures.

4 Experiments

Our model is primarily intended as an exploratory analysis tool for organizational communication
networks. In this section  we use the NHC email network to showcase our model’s ability to discover
and visualize topic-speciﬁc communication subnetworks. First  however  we test our underlying
modeling assumptions via three quantitative validation tasks  as recommended by Schrodt [11].

4.1 Link Prediction

r }A

In order to gauge our model’s predictive performance  we evaluated its ability to predict the recipi-
ents of “test” emails  from either the NHC email network or the Enron data set  conditioned on the
text of those emails and the identities of their authors. For each test email d  the binary variables
indicating the recipients of that email  i.e.  {y(d)
r=1  were treated as unobserved. Typical values
for these variables were sampled from their joint posterior distribution and compared to the true
values to yield an F1 score. We formed a test split of each data set by randomly selecting emails
with probability 0.1. For each data set  we averaged the F1 scores over ﬁve random test splits.
We compared our model’s performance with that of two baselines and three existing network mod-
els  thereby situating it within the existing literature. Given a test email authored by actor a  our
simplest baseline na¨ıvely predicts that actor a will include actor r as a recipient of that email with
probability equal to the number of non-test emails sent from actor a to actor r divided by the to-
tal number of non-test emails sent by actor a. Our second baseline is a variant of our model in
which each topic-speciﬁc communication pattern P (t) is represented explicitly via A(A + 1) / 2
probabilities drawn from a symmetric Beta prior with concentration parameter γ. Comparing our
model to this variant enables us to validate our assumption that topic-speciﬁc communication pat-
terns can indeed be accurately represented by a set of A points (one per actor) in K-dimensional
Euclidean space. We also compared our model’s performance to that of three existing network mod-
els: a variant of Erosheva et al.’s model for analyzing scientiﬁc publications [4]  LSM [7]  and the

mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel (MMSB) [12]. Erosheva et al.’s model can be viewed as
a variant of our model in which the topic assignment for each y(d)
is drawn from θ(d) instead of
the empirical distribution over topics deﬁned by z(d). Like our second baseline  each topic-speciﬁc
communication pattern is represented explicitly via probabilities drawn from a symmetric Beta prior
with concentration parameter γ; however  unlike this baseline  each one is represented using A prob-
abilities such that p(t)
r . LSM can be viewed as a network-only variant of our model in which
text is not modeled. As a result  there are no topics and a single communication pattern P . This pat-
tern is represented implicitly via a set of A actor-speciﬁc points in K-dimensional Euclidean space.
Finally  MMSB is a widely-used model for mixed-membership community discovery in networks.
For our model and all its variants  typical values for {y(d)
r=1 can be sampled from their joint
posterior distribution using an appropriately-modiﬁed version of the Metropolis-within-Gibbs algo-
rithm in Section 2.1. In all our experiments  we ran this algorithm for 40 000–50 000 iterations. On
iteration i  we deﬁned each proposal distribution to be a Gaussian distribution centered on the value
from iteration i− 1 with covariance matrix max (1  100 / i) I  thereby resulting in larger covariances
for earlier iterations. Beta–binomial conjugacy allows the elements of P (t) to be marginalized out
in both our second baseline and Erosheva et al.’s model. For MMSB  typical values can be sam-
pled using a modiﬁed version of Chang’s Gibbs sampling algorithm [13]. We ran this algorithm
for 5 000 iterations. For all models involving topics  we set concentration parameter α to 1 for the
NHC network and 2 for the Enron data set. For both data sets  we set concentration parameter β to
0.01V .4 We varied the number of topics from 1 to 200. In order to facilitate visualization  we used
2-dimensional Euclidean spaces for our model. For LSM  however  we varied the dimensionality of
the Euclidean space from 1 to 200. We report only those results obtained using the best-performing
dimensionality. For our second baseline and Erosheva et al.’s model  we set concentration parameter
γ to 0.02. For MMSB  we performed a grid search over all hyperparameter values and the number
of blocks and  as with LSM  report only those results obtained using the best-performing values.5
F1 scores  averaged over ﬁve random test splits of each data set  are shown in Figure 2. Although our
model is intended for exploratory analysis  it achieves better link prediction performance than the
other models. Furthermore  the fact that our model outperforms our second baseline and Erosheva
et al.’s model validates our assumption that topic-speciﬁc communication patterns can indeed be
accurately represented by a set of A actor-speciﬁc points in 2-dimensional Euclidean space.

4.2 Topic Coherence

When evaluating unsupervised topic models  topic coherence metrics [14  15] are often used as a
proxy for subjective evaluation of semantic coherence. In order to demonstrate that incorporating
network data does not impair our model’s ability to model text  we compared the coherence of topics
inferred using our model with the coherence of topics inferred using LDA  our second baseline  and
Erosheva et al.’s model. For each model  we varied the number of topics from 1 to 200 and drew ﬁve
samples from the joint posterior distribution over the unobserved random variables in that model. We
evaluated the topics resulting from each sample using Mimno et al.’s coherence metric [14]. Topic
coherence  averaged over the ﬁve samples  is shown in Figure 2. Our model achieves coherence
comparable to that of LDA. This result  when combined with the results in Section 4.1  demonstrates
that our model can achieve state-of-the-art predictive performance while producing coherent topics.

4.3 Posterior Predictive Checks

We used posterior predictive checking to assess the extent to which our model is a “good ﬁt” for the
NHC email network [16  17]. Speciﬁcally  we deﬁned four network statistics (i.e.  four discrepancy
functions) that summarize meaningful aspects of the NHC network: generalized graph transitivity 
the dyad intensity distribution  the vertex degree distribution  and the geodesic distance distribution.6
We then generated 1 000 synthetic networks from the posterior predictive distribution implied by our

4These values were obtained by slice sampling typical values for the concentration parameters in LDA.

They are consistent with the concentration parameter values used in previous work [9].

5These values correspond to a Dir(0.1  . . .   0.1) prior over block memberships  a Beta(0.1  0.1) prior over

diagonal entries of the blockmodel  a Beta(0.01  0.01) prior over off-diagonal entries  and 30 blocks.

6These statistics are deﬁned in the supplementary materials.

model and the NHC network. We applied each discrepancy function to each synthetic network to
yield four distributions over the values of the four network statistics. If our model is a “good ﬁt”
for the NHC network  these distributions should be centered around the values of the corresponding
discrepancy functions when computed using the observed NHC network. As shown in Figure 3 
our model generates synthetic networks with dyad intensity  vertex degree  and geodesic distance
distributions that are very similar to those of the NHC network. The distribution over synthetic graph
transitivity values is not centered around the observed graph transitivity  but the observed transitivity
is not sufﬁciently far into the tail of the distribution to warrant reparameterization of our model.

4.4 Exploratory Analysis

In order to demonstrate our model’s novel ability to discover and visualize topic-speciﬁc communi-
cation patterns  we performed an exploratory analysis of four such patterns inferred from the NHC
email network using our model. These patterns are visualized in Figure 4. Each pattern is repre-
sented implicitly via a single set of A points in 2-dimensional Euclidean space drawn from their joint
posterior distribution. The recipients of any email associated with topic t are more likely to be those
actors near to the email’s author in the Euclidean space corresponding to that topic. We selected the
patterns in Figure 4 so as to highlight the types of insights that can be obtained using our model.
Although many structural properties may be of interest  we focus on modularity and assortativity.
For each topic-speciﬁc communication pattern  we examined whether there are active  disconnected
components in that topic’s Euclidean space (i.e.  high modularity). The presence of such compo-
nents indicates that there are groups of actors who engage in within- but not between-group com-
munication about that topic. We also used a combination of node proximity and node coloration
to determine whether there is more communication between departments that belong to the same
“division” in the New Hanover County government organizational chart than between departments
within different divisions (i.e.  assortativity). In Figure 4  we show one topic that exhibits strong
modularity and little assortativity (the “Public Signage” topic)  one topic that exhibits strong as-
sortativity and little modularity (the “Broadcast Messages” topic)  and one topic that exhibits both
strong assortativity and strong modularity (the “Meeting Scheduling” topic). The “Public Relations”
topic  which includes communication with news agencies  is mostly dominated by a cluster involv-
ing many departments. Finally  the “Meeting Scheduling” topic displays hierarchical structure  with
two assistant county managers located at the centers of groups that correspond to their divisions.
Exploratory analysis of communication patterns is a powerful tool for understanding organizational
communication networks. For example  examining assortativity can reveal whether actual commu-
nication patterns resemble ofﬁcial organizational structures. Similarly  if a communication pattern
exhibits modularity  each disconnected component may beneﬁt from organizational efforts to fa-
cilitate inter-component communication. Finally  structural properties other than assortativity and
modularity may also yield scientiﬁc or practical insights  depending on organizational needs.

Figure 4: Four topic-speciﬁc communication patterns inferred from the NHC email network. Each
pattern is labeled with a human-selected name for the corresponding topic  along with that topic’s
most probable words in order of decreasing probability. The size of each manager’s acronym in
a is the degree of actor a in that
topic t’s pattern (given by 0.45 + 1.25
subnetwork) indicates how often that manager communicates about that topic. Managers’ acronyms
are colored according to their respective division in the New Hanover County organizational chart.
The acronym “AM” appears twice in all plots because there are two assistant county managers.

5 Conclusions

We introduced a new Bayesian admixture model for the discovery and visualization of topic-speciﬁc
communication subnetworks. Although our model is intended for exploratory analysis  the valida-
tion experiments described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 demonstrate that our model can achieve state-
of-the-art predictive performance while exhibiting topic coherence comparable to that of LDA. To
showcase our model’s ability to discover and visualize topic-speciﬁc communication patterns  we
introduced a new data set (the NHC email network) and analyzed four such patterns inferred from
this data set using our model. Via this analysis  were are able to examine the extent to which actual
communication patterns resemble ofﬁcial organizational structures and identify groups of managers
who engage in within- but not between-group communication about certain topics. Together  these
predictive and exploratory analyses lead us to recommend our model for any exploratory analysis of
email networks or other similarly-structured communication data. Finally  our model is capable of
producing principled visualizations of email networks  i.e.  visualizations that have precise mathe-
matical interpretations in terms of this model and its relationship to the observed data. We advocate
for principled visualization as a primary objective in the development of new network models.
