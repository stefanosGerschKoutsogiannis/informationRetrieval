Abstract

Given two candidate models  and a set of target observations  we address the prob-
lem of measuring the relative goodness of ﬁt of the two models. We propose two
new statistical tests which are nonparametric  computationally efﬁcient (runtime
complexity is linear in the sample size)  and interpretable. As a unique advantage 
our tests can produce a set of examples (informative features) indicating the regions
in the data domain where one model ﬁts signiﬁcantly better than the other. In a
real-world problem of comparing GAN models  the test power of our new test
matches that of the state-of-the-art test of relative goodness of ﬁt  while being one
order of magnitude faster.

Introduction

1
One of the most fruitful areas in recent machine learning research has been the development of
effective generative models for very complex and high dimensional data. Chief among these have
been the generative adversarial networks [Goodfellow et al.  2014  Arjovsky et al.  2017  Nowozin
et al.  2016]  where samples may be generated without an explicit generative model or likelihood
function. A related thread has emerged in the statistics community with the advent of Approximate
Bayesian Computation  where simulation-based models without closed-form likelihoods are widely
applied in bioinformatics applications [see Lintusaari et al.  2017  for a review]. In these cases  we
might have several competing models  and wish to evaluate which is the better ﬁt for the data.
The problem of model criticism is traditionally deﬁned as follows: how well does a model Q ﬁt a
given sample Zn := {zi}n
∼ R? This task can be addressed in two ways: by comparing samples
i=1 from the model Q and data samples  or by directly evaluating the goodness of ﬁt of
Yn := {yi}n
the model itself. In both of these cases  the tests have a null hypothesis (that the model agrees with
the data)  which they will reject given sufﬁcient evidence. Two-sample tests fall into the ﬁrst category:
there are numerous nonparametric tests which may be used [Alba Fernández et al.  2008  Gretton
et al.  2012a  Friedman and Rafsky  1979  Székely and Rizzo  2004  Rosenbaum  2005  Harchaoui
et al.  2008  Hall and Tajvidi  2002  Jitkrittum et al.  2016]  and recent work in applying two-sample
tests to the problem of model criticism [Lloyd and Ghahramani  2015]. A second approach requires
the model density q explicitly. In the case of simple models for which normalisation is not an issue
(e.g.  checking for Gaussianity)  several tests exist [Baringhaus and Henze  1988  Székely and Rizzo

2005]; when a model density is known only up to a normalisation constant  tests of goodness of ﬁt
have been developed using a Stein-based divergence [Chwialkowski et al.  2016  Liu et al.  2016 
Jitkrittum et al.  2017b].
An issue with the above notion of model criticism  particularly in the case of modern generative
models  is that any hypothetical model Q that we design is likely a poor ﬁt to the data. Indeed  as
noted in Yamada et al. [2018  Section 5.5]  comparing samples from various Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) models [Goodfellow et al.  2014] to the reference sample Zn by a variant of the
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) test [Gretton et al.  2012a] leads to the trivial conclusion that
all models are wrong [Box  1976]  i.e.  H0 : Q = R is rejected by the test in all cases. A more
relevant question in practice is thus: “Given two models P and Q  which is closer to R  and in what
ways?” This is the problem we tackle in this work.
To our knowledge  the only nonparametric statistical test of relative goodness of ﬁt is the Rel-MMD
test of Bounliphone et al. [2015]  based on the maximum mean discrepancy [MMD  Gretton et al. 
2012a]. While shown to be practical (e.g.  for comparing network architectures of generative
networks)  two issues remain to be addressed. Firstly  its runtime complexity is quadratic in the
sample size n  meaning that it can be applied only to problems of moderate size. Secondly and more
importantly  it does not give an indication of where one model is better than the other. This is essential
for model comparison: in practical settings  it is highly unlikely that one model will be uniformly
better than another in all respects: for instance  in hand-written digit generation  one model might
produce better “3”s  and the other better “6”s. The ability to produce a few examples which indicate
regions (in the data domain) in which one model ﬁts better than the other will be a valuable tool for
model comparison. This type of interpretability is useful especially in learning generative models
with GANs  where the “mode collapse” problem is widespread [Salimans et al.  2016  Srivastava
et al.  2017]. The idea of generating such distinguishing examples (so called test locations) was
explored in Jitkrittum et al. [2016  2017b] in the context of model criticism and two-sample testing.
In this work  we propose two new linear-time tests for relative goodness-of-ﬁt. In the ﬁrst test  the two
models P  Q are represented by their two respective samples Xn and Yn  and the test generalises that
of Jitkrittum et al. [2016]. In the second  the test has access to the probability density functions p  q
of the two respective candidate models P  Q (which need only be known up to normalisation)  and is
a three-way analogue of the test of Jitkrittum et al. [2017b]. In both cases  the tests return locations
indicating where one model outperforms the other. We emphasise that the practitioner must choose
the model ordering  since as noted earlier  this will determine the locations that the test prioritises. We
further note that the two tests complement each other  as both address different aspects of the model
comparison problem. The ﬁrst test simply ﬁnds the location where the better model produces mass
closest to the test sample: a worse model can produce too much mass  or too little. The second test
does not address the overall probability mass  but rather the shape of the model density: speciﬁcally 
it penalises the model whose derivative log density differs most from the target (the interpretation
is illustrated in our experiments). In the experiment on comparing two GAN models  we ﬁnd that
the performance of our new test matches that of Rel-MMD while being one order of magnitude
faster. Further  unlike the popular Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) [Heusel et al.  2017] which can
give a wrong conclusion when two GANs have equal goodness of ﬁt  our proposed method has a
well-calibrated threshold  allowing the user to ﬂexibly control the false positive rate.
2 Measures of Goodness of Fit
In the proposed tests  we test the relative goodness of ﬁt by comparing the relative magnitudes of
two distances  following Bounliphone et al. [2015]. More speciﬁcally  let D(P  R) be a discrepancy
measure between P and R. Then  the problem can be formulated as a hypothesis test proposing
H0 : D(P  R) ≤ D(Q  R) against H1 : D(P  R) > D(Q  R). This is the approach taken by Bounli-
phone et al. who use the MMD as D  resulting in the relative MMD test (Rel-MMD). The proposed
Rel-UME and Rel-FSSD tests are based on two recently proposed discrepancy measures for D:
the Unnormalized Mean Embeddings (UME) statistic [Chwialkowski et al.  2015  Jitkrittum et al. 
2016]  and the Finite-Set Stein Discrepancy (FSSD) [Jitkrittum et al.  2017b]  for the sample-based
and density-based settings  respectively. We ﬁrst review UME and FSSD. We will extend these two
measures to construct two new relative goodness-of-ﬁt tests in Section 3. We assume throughout that
the probability measures P  Q  R have a common support X ⊆ Rd.
The Unnormalized Mean Embeddings (UME) Statistic UME is a (random) distance between two
probability distributions [Chwialkowski et al.  2015] originally proposed for two-sample testing for

et al.  2007]. Gretton et al. [2012a] shows that when kY is characteristic [Sriperumbudur et al.  2011] 
the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) witness function witQ R(w) := µQ(w) − µR(w) is a
(cid:80)J
zero function if and only if Q = R. Based on this fact  the UME statistic evaluates the squared
witness function at Jq test locations W := {wj}Jq
j=1 ⊂ X to determine whether it is zero. Formally 
j=1(µQ(wj) − µR(wj))2.
the population squared UME statistic is deﬁned as U 2(Q  R) := 1

For our purpose  it will be useful to rewrite the UME statistic as follows. Deﬁne the feature

function ψW (y) := 1√Jq

i=1 ψW (yi). The squared population UME statistic is equivalent
W := 1

to U 2(Q  R) := (cid:107)ψQ
2. For W ∼ η where η is a distribution with a density  Theorem 2

clearly can be computed in O(n) time. Jitkrittum et al. [2016] proposed optimizing the test locations
W and kY so as to maximize the test power (i.e.  the probability of rejecting H0 when it is false) of
the two-sample test with the normalized version of the UME statistic. It was shown that the optimized
locations give an interpretable indication of where Q and R differ in the input domain X .
The Finite-Set Stein Discrepancy (FSSD) FSSD is a discrepancy between two density func-
tions q and r. Let X ⊆ Rd be a connected open set. Assume that Q  R have probability
density functions denoted by q  r respectively. Given a positive deﬁnite kernel kY   the Stein
witness function [Chwialkowski et al.  2016  Liu et al.  2016] gq r : X → Rd between q and
d (w))(cid:62)  where ξq(z  w) :=
r is deﬁned as gq r(w) := Ez∼r [ξq(z  w)] = (gq r
kY (z  w)∇z log q(z) + ∇zkY (z  w). Under appropriate conditions (see Chwialkowski et al. [2016 
Theorem 2.2] and Liu et al. [2016  Proposition 3.3])  it can be shown that gq r = 0 (i.e.  the zero
function) if and only if q = r. An implication of this result is that the deviation of gq r from the zero
function can be used as a measure of mismatch between q and r. Different ways to characterize such
deviation have led to different measures of goodness of ﬁt.
The FSSD characterizes such deviation from 0 by evaluating gq r at Jq test locations. Formally 
(cid:80)Jq
given a set of test locations W = {wj}Jq
q(r) :=

and Ξq(z) ∈ Rd×Jq is deﬁned such that [Ξq(z)]i j := ξq

time. It was shown in Jitkrittum et al. [2017b] that the test locations W can be chosen by maximizing
statistic. We note that  unlike UME (cid:99)F 2
q as the
q requires access to the density q. Another way to characterize
the deviation of gq r from the zero function is to use the norm in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space
(RKHS) that contains gq r. This measure is known as the Kernel Stein Discrepancy having a runtime
complexity of O(n2) [Chwialkowski et al.  2016  Liu et al.  2016  Gorham and Mackey  2015].

adjust it to be √νΦ−1(1 − α)  and use it as the test threshold Tα. The adjusted threshold can be
estimated easily by replacing ν with ˆνn  a consistent estimate based on samples. It can be shown that
the test with the adjusted threshold is still level-α (more conservative in rejecting H0). We note that
the same approach of adjusting the threshold is used in Rel-MMD [Bounliphone et al.  2015].
Better Fit of Q in Terms of W . When specifying V and W   the model comparison is done by
comparing the goodness of ﬁt of P (to R) as measured in the regions speciﬁed by V to the goodness
of ﬁt of Q as measured in the regions speciﬁed by W . By specifying V and setting W = V  
testing with Rel-UME is equivalent to posing the question “Does Q ﬁt to the data better than P
does  as measured in the regions of V ?” For instance  the observed sample from R might contain
smiling and non-smiling faces  and P  Q are candidate generative models for face images. If we are
interested in checking the relative ﬁt in the regions of smiling faces  V can be a set of smiling faces.
In the followings  we will assume V = W and k := kX = kY for interpretability. Investigating
the general case without these constraints will be an interesting topic of future study. Importantly
we emphasize that test results are always conditioned on the speciﬁed V . To be precise  let U 2
V
be the squared UME statistic deﬁned by V . It is entirely realistic that the test rejects H0 in favor
(Q  R) (i.e.  Q ﬁts better) for some V1  and also rejects H0 in favor of
of H1 : U 2
V1
the opposite alternative H1 : U 2
(P  R) (i.e.  P ﬁts better) for another setting of V2.
V2
This is because the regions in which the model comparison takes place are different in the two
cases. Although not discussed in Bounliphone et al. [2015]  the same behaviour can be observed for
Rel-MMD i.e.  test results are conditioned on the choice of kernel.
In some cases  it is not known in advance what features are better represented by one model vs another 
and it becomes necessary to learn these features from the model outputs. In this case  we propose set-
ting V to contain the locations which maximize the probability that the test can detect the better ﬁt of
Q  as measured at the locations. Following the same principle as in Gretton et al. [2012b]  Sutherland

where γ > 0 is a small regularization parameter added to promote numerical stability following
Jitkrittum et al. [2017b  p. 5]. To control the false rejection rate  the maximization is carried out on
held-out training data which are independent of the data used for testing. In the experiments (Section
4)  we hold out 20% of the data for the optimization. A unique consequence of this procedure is that
we obtain optimized V ∗ which indicates where Q ﬁts signiﬁcantly better than P . We note that this
interpretation only holds if the test  using the optimized hyperparameters (k∗  V ∗)  decides to reject
H0. The optimized locations may not be interpretable if the test fails to reject H0.

of Rel-FSSD. The rest of the derivations closely follow Rel-UME. These include the interpretation
that the relative ﬁt is measured at the speciﬁed locations given in V and W   and the derivation of
Rel-FSSD’s power criterion (which can be derived using the asymptotic distribution of ˆSF
n given in
Theorem 2  following the same line of reasoning as in the case of Rel-UME). A major difference is
that Rel-FSSD requires explicit (gradients of the log) density functions of the two models  allowing
it to gain structural information of the models that may not be as easily observed in ﬁnite samples.
We next state the asymptotic distribution of the statistic (Theorem 2)  which is needed for obtaining
the threshold and for deriving the power criterion. The proof closely follows the proof of Theorem 1

4 Experiments
In this section  we demonstrate the two proposed tests on both toy and real problems. We start
with an illustration of the behaviors of Rel-UME and Rel-FSSD’s power criteria using simple one-
dimensional problems. In the second experiment  we examine the test powers of the two proposed
tests using three toy problems. In the third experiment  we compare two hypothetical generative
models on the CIFAR-10 dataset [Krizhevsky and Hinton  2009] and demonstrate that the learned test
locations (images) can clearly indicate the types of images that are better modeled by one of the two
candidate models. In the last two experiments  we consider the problem of determining the relative
goodness of ﬁt of two given Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [Goodfellow et al.  2014].
Code to reproduce all the results is available at https://github.com/wittawatj/kernel-mod.
1. Illustration of Rel-UME and Rel-FSSD Power Criteria We consider k = kX = kY to be a
Gaussian kernel  and set V = W = {v} (one test location). The power criterion of Rel-UME
as a function of v can be written as 1
Q(v))1/2 where wit(·) is the MMD witness
2
function (see Section 2)  and we explicitly indicate the dependency on v. To illustrate  we consider
two Gaussian models p  q with different means but the same variance  and set r to be a mixture of p
and q. Figure 1a shows that when each component in r has the same mixing proportion  the power
criterion of Rel-UME is a zero function indicating that p and q have the same goodness of ﬁt to r
everywhere. To understand this  notice that at the left mode of r  p has excessive probability mass
(compared to r)  while q has almost no mass at all. Both models are thus wrong at the left mode
of r. However  since the extra probability mass of p is equal to the missing mass of q  Rel-UME
considers p and q as having the same goodness of ﬁt. In Figure 1b  the left mode of r now has a
mixing proportion of only 30%  and r more closely matches q. The power criterion is thus positive at
the left mode indicating that q has a better ﬁt.
The power criterion of Rel-FSSD indicates that q ﬁts better at the right mode of r in the case of
equal mixing proportion (see Figure 1c). In one dimension  the Stein witness function gq r (deﬁned

in Section 2) can be written as gq r(w) = Ez∼r [kY (z  w)∇z (log q(z) − log r(z))]  which is the
expectation under r of the difference in the derivative log of q and r  weighted by the kernel kY .
The Stein witness thus only captures the matching of the shapes of the two densities (as given by
the derivative log). Unlike the MMD witness  the Stein witness is insensitive to the mismatch of
probability masses i.e.  it is independent of the normalizer of q. In Figure 1c  since the shape of q and
the shape of the right mode of r match  the Stein witness gq r (dashed blue curve) vanishes at the
right mode of r  indicating a good ﬁt of q in the region. The mismatch between the shape of q and the
shape of r at the left mode of r is what creates the peak of gq r. The same reasoning holds for the
Stein witness gp r. The power criterion of Rel-FSSD  which is given by 1
q (w))1/2  
2
is thus positive at the right mode of r (shapes of q and r matched there)  and negative at the left
mode of r (shapes of p and r matched there). To summarize  Rel-UME measures the relative ﬁt by
checking the probability mass  while Rel-FSSD does so by matching the shapes of the densities.
2. Test Powers on Toy Problems The goal of this experiment is to investigate the rejection rates of
several variations of the two proposed tests. To this end  we study three toy problems  each having
its own characteristics. All the three distributions in each problem have density functions to allow
comparison with Rel-FSSD.

1. Mean shift: All the three distributions are isotropic multivariate normal distributions: p =
N ([0.5  0  . . .   0]  I)  q = N ([1  0  . . . 0]  I)  and r = N (0  I)  deﬁned on R50. The two
candidates models p and q differ in the mean of the ﬁrst dimension. In this problem  the null
hypothesis H0 is true since p is closer to r.
2. Blobs: Each distribution is given by a mixture of four Gaussian distributions organized in a grid
in R2. Samples from p  q and r are shown in Figure 4. In this problem  q is closer to r than p is
i.e.  H1 is true. One characteristic of this problem is that the difference between p and q takes
place in a small scale relative to the global structure of the data. This problem was studied in
Gretton et al. [2012b]  Chwialkowski et al. [2015].
3. RBM: Each of the three distributions is given by a Gaussian Bernoulli Restricted Boltz-
mann Machine (RBM) model with density function p(cid:48)
B b c(x  h)  where
p(cid:48)
  h ∈ {−1  1}dh is a latent vec-
B b c(x  h) := 1
tor  Z is the normalizer  and B  b  c are model parameters. Let r(x) := p(cid:48)
B b c(x)  p(x) :=
p(cid:48)
Bp b c(x)  and q(x) := p(cid:48)
Bq b c(x). Following a similar setting as in Liu et al. [2016]  Jitkrit-
tum et al. [2017b]  we set the parameters of the data generating density r by uniformly randomly
setting entries of B to be from {−1  1}  and drawing entries of b and c from the standard normal
distribution. Let δ be a matrix of the same size as B such that δ1 1 = 1 and all other entries are
0. We set Bq = B + 0.3δ and Bp = B + δ  where the perturbation constant  is varied. We
ﬁx the sample size n to 2000. Perturbing only one entry of B creates a problem in which the
difference of distributions can be difﬁcult to detect. This serves as a challenging benchmark to
measure the sensitivity of statistical tests [Jitkrittum et al.  2017b]. We set d = 20 and dh = 5.
We compare three kernel-based tests: Rel-UME  Rel-FSSD  and Rel-MMD (the relative MMD test
of Bounliphone et al. [2015])  all using a Gaussian kernel. For Rel-UME and Rel-FSSD we set
kX = kY = k  where the the Gaussian width of k  and the test locations are chosen by maximizing
their respective power criteria described in Section 3 on 20% of the data. The optimization procedure
is described in Section A (appendix). Following Bounliphone et al. [2015]  the Gaussian width of
Rel-MMD is chosen by the median heuristic as implemented in the code by the authors. In the RBM

problem  all problem parameters B  b  and c are drawn only once and ﬁxed. Only the samples vary
across trials.

Figure 4: Blobs problem
samples: p  q  r.

Figure 2 shows the test powers of all the tests. When H0 holds  all tests
have false rejection rates (type-I errors) bounded above by α = 0.05 (Fig-
ure 2a). In the Blobs problem (Figure 2b)  it can be seen that Rel-UME
achieves larger power at all sample sizes  compared to Rel-MMD. Since
the relative goodness of ﬁt of p and q must be compared locally  the
optimized test locations of Rel-UME are suitable for detecting such local
differences. The poor performance of Rel-MMD is caused by unsuitable
choices of the kernel bandwidth. The bandwidth chosen by the median
heuristic is only appropriate for capturing the global length scale of the
problem. It is thus too large to capture small-scale differences. No ex-
isting work has proposed a kernel selection procedure for Rel-MMD. Regarding the number J
of test locations  we observe that changing J from 1 to 5 drastically increases the test power of
Rel-UME  since more regions characterizing the differences can be pinpointed. Rel-MMD exhibits
a quadratic-time proﬁle (Figure 2c) as a function of n.
Figure 2d shows the rejection rates against the perturbation strength  in p in the RBM problem. When
 ≤ 0.3  p is closer to r than q is (i.e.  H0 holds). We observe that all the tests have well-controlled
false rejection rates in this case. At  = 0.35  while q is closer (i.e.  H1 holds)  the relative amount
by which q is closer to r is so small that a signiﬁcant difference cannot be detected when p and q
are represented by samples of size n = 2000  hence the low powers of Rel-UME and Rel-MMD.
Structural information provided by the density functions allows Rel-FSSD (both J = 1 and J = 5)
to detect the difference even at  = 0.35  as can be seen from the high test powers. The fact that
Rel-MMD has higher power than Rel-UME  and the fact that changing J from 1 to 5 increases the
power only slightly suggest that the differences may be spatially diffuse (rather than local).
3. Informative Power Objective In this part  we demonstrate that test locations having positive
(negative) values of the power criterion correctly indicate the regions in which Q has a better (worse)
ﬁt. We consider image samples from three categories of the CIFAR-10 dataset [Krizhevsky and
Hinton  2009]: airplane  automobile  and cat. We partition the images  and assume that the sample
from P consists of 2000 airplane  1500 cat images  the sample from Q consists of 2000 automobile 
1500 cat images  and the reference sample from R consists of 2000 automobile  1500 cat images. All
samples are independent. We consider a held-out random sample consisting of 1000 images from each

category  serving as a pool of test location candidates. We set the kernel to be the Gaussian kernel
on 2048 features extracted by the Inception-v3 network at the pool3 layer [Szegedy et al.  2016].
We evaluate the power criterion of Rel-UME at each of the test locations in the pool individually.
The histogram of the criterion values is shown in Figure 3a. We observe that all the power criterion
values are non-negative  conﬁrming that Q is better than P everywhere. Figure 3b shows the top 15
test locations as sorted in ascending order by the criterion  consisting of automobile images. These
indicate the regions in the data domain where Q ﬁts better. Notice that cat images do not have high
positive criterion values because they can be modeled equally well by P and Q  and thus have scores
close to zero as shown in Figure 3b.
4. Testing GAN Models In this experiment  we apply the proposed Rel-UME test to comparing
two generative adversarial networks (GANs) [Goodfellow et al.  2014]. We consider the CelebA
dataset [Liu et al.  2015]3 in which each data point is an image of a celebrity with 40 binary attributes
annotated e.g.  pointy nose  smiling  mustache  etc. We create a partition of the images on the smiling
attribute  thereby creating two disjoint subsets of smiling and non-smiling images. A set of 30000
images from each subset is held out for subsequent relative goodness-of-ﬁt testing  and the rest are
used for training two GAN models: a model for smiling images  and a model for non-smiling images.
Generated samples and details of the trained models can be found in Section B (appendix). The two
models are trained once and ﬁxed throughout.
In addition to Rel-MMD  we compare the proposed Rel-UME to Kernel Inception Distance (KID)
[Bi´nkowski et al.  2018]  and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) [Heusel et al.  2017]  which are
distances between two samples (originally proposed for comparing a sample of generated images 
and a reference sample). All images are represented by 2048 features extracted from the Inception-v3
network [Szegedy et al.  2016] at the pool3 layer following Bi´nkowski et al. [2018]. When adapted
for three samples  KID is in fact a variant of Rel-MMD in which a third-order polynomial kernel
is used instead of a Gaussian kernel (on top of the pool3 features). Following Bi´nkowski et al.
[2018]  we construct a bootstrap estimator for FID (10 subsamples with 1000 points in each). For
the proposed Rel-UME  the J ∈ {10  20  40} test locations are randomly set to contain J/2 smiling
images  and J/2 non-smiling images drawn from a held-out set of real images. We create problem
variations by setting P  Q  R ∈ {S  N  RS  RN  RM} where S denotes generated smiling images
(from the trained model)  N denotes generated non-smiling images  M denotes an equal mixture of
smiling and non-smiling images  and the preﬁx R indicates that real images are used (as opposed to
generated ones). The sample size is n = 2000  and each problem variation is repeated for 10 trials
for FID (due to its high complexity) and 100 trials for other methods. The rejection rates from all the
methods are shown in Table 1. Here  the test result for FID in each trial is considered “reject H0” if
FID(P  R) > FID(Q  R). Heusel et al. [2017] did not propose FID as a statistical test. That said 
there is a generic way of constructing a relative goodness-of-ﬁt test based on repeated permutation of
samples of P and Q to simulate from the null distribution. However  FID requires computing the
square root of the feature covariance matrix (2048 x 2048)  and is computationally too expensive for
permutation testing.
Overall  we observe that the proposed test does at least equally well as existing approaches  in
identifying the better model in each case. In problems 1 and 2  P and Q have the same goodness of ﬁt 
by design. In these cases  all the tests correctly yield low rejection rates  staying roughly at the design
level (α = 0.01). Without a properly chosen threshold  the (false) rejection rates of FID ﬂuctuate

around the expected value of 0.5. This means that simply comparing FIDs (or other distances) to
the reference sample without a calibrated threshold can lead to a wrong conclusion on the relative
goodness of ﬁt. The FID is further complicated by the fact that its estimator suffers from bias in ways
that are hard to model and correct for (see Bi´nkowski et al. [2018  Section D.1]). Problem 4 is a case
where the model Q is better. We notice that increasing the number of test locations of Rel-UME
helps detect the better ﬁt of Q. In problem 5  the reference sample is bimodal  and each model can
capture only one of the two modes (analogous to the synthetic problem in Figure 1a). All the tests
correctly indicate that no model is better than another.
5. Examining GAN Training In the ﬁnal experiment  we show that the power criterion of Rel-UME
can be used to examine the relative change of the distribution of a GAN model after training further
for a few epochs. To illustrate  we consider training an LSGAN model [Mao et al.  2017] on MNIST 
a dataset in which each data point is an image of a handwritten digit. We set P and Q to be LSGAN
models after 15 epochs and 17 epochs of training  respectively. Details regarding the network
architecture  training  and the kernel (chosen to be a Gaussian kernel on features extracted from a
convolutional network) can be found in Section D. Samples from P and Q are shown in Figures 5a
and 5b (see Figure 8 in the appendix for more samples).
We set the test locations V to be the set Vi containing J = 40 randomly selected real images of digit i 
for i ∈ {0  . . .   9}. We then draw n = 2000 points from P  Q and the real data (R)  and use V = Vi
to compute the power criterion for i ∈ {0  . . .   9}. The procedure is repeated for 200 trials where V
and the samples are redrawn each time. The results are shown in Figure 5c. We observe that when
V = V3 (i.e.  box plot at the digit 3) or V9  the power criterion values are mostly negative  indicating
that P is better than Q  as measured in the regions indicated by real images of the digits 3 or 9. By
contrast  when V = V6  the large mass of the box plot in the positive orthant shows that Q is better
in the regions of the digit 6. For other digits  the criterion values spread around zero  showing that
there is no difference between P and Q  on average. We further conﬁrm that the class proportions
of the generated digits from both models are roughly correct (i.e.  uniform distribution)  meaning
that the difference between P and Q in these cases is not due to the mismatch in class proportions
(see Section D). These observations imply that after the 15th epoch  training this particular LSGAN
model two epochs further improves generation of the digit 6  and degrades generation of digits 3
and 9. A non-monotonic improvement during training is not uncommon since at the 15th epoch the
training has not converged. More experimental results from comparing different GAN variants on
MNIST can be found in Section E in the appendix.
We note that the set V does not need to contain test locations of the same digit. In fact  the notion of
class labels may not even exist in general. It is up to the user to deﬁne V to contain examples which
capture the relevant concept of interest. For instance  to compare the ability of models to generate
straight strokes  one might include digits 1 and 7 in the set V . An alternative to manual speciﬁcation
of V is to optimize the power criterion to ﬁnd the locations that best distinguish the two models
(as done in experiment 2). To illustrate  we consider greedily optimizing the power criterion by
iteratively selecting a test location (from real images) which best improves the objective. Maximizing
the objective yields locations that indicate the better ﬁt of Q  whereas minimization gives locations
which show the better ﬁt of P (recall from Figure 1). The optimized locations are shown in Figure 5d.
The results largely agree with our previous observations  and do not require manually specifying V .
This optimization procedure is applicable to any models which can be sampled.
