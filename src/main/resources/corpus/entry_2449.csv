Abstract

A number of recent works have proposed attention models for Visual Question
Answering (VQA) that generate spatial maps highlighting image regions relevant to
answering the question. In this paper  we argue that in addition to modeling “where
to look” or visual attention  it is equally important to model “what words to listen
to” or question attention. We present a novel co-attention model for VQA that
jointly reasons about image and question attention. In addition  our model reasons
about the question (and consequently the image via the co-attention mechanism)
in a hierarchical fashion via a novel 1-dimensional convolution neural networks
(CNN). Our model improves the state-of-the-art on the VQA dataset from 60.3% to
60.5%  and from 61.6% to 63.3% on the COCO-QA dataset. By using ResNet  the
performance is further improved to 62.1% for VQA and 65.4% for COCO-QA.1.

Introduction

1
Visual Question Answering (VQA) [2  6  14  15  27] has emerged as a prominent multi-discipline
research problem in both academia and industry. To correctly answer visual questions about an
image  the machine needs to understand both the image and question. Recently  visual attention based
models [18  21–23] have been explored for VQA  where the attention mechanism typically produces
a spatial map highlighting image regions relevant to answering the question.
So far  all attention models for VQA in literature have focused on the problem of identifying “where
to look” or visual attention. In this paper  we argue that the problem of identifying “which words to
listen to” or question attention is equally important. Consider the questions “how many horses are
in this image?” and “how many horses can you see in this image?". They have the same meaning 
essentially captured by the ﬁrst three words. A machine that attends to the ﬁrst three words would
arguably be more robust to linguistic variations irrelevant to the meaning and answer of the question.
Motivated by this observation  in addition to reasoning about visual attention  we also address the
problem of question attention. Speciﬁcally  we present a novel multi-modal attention model for VQA
with the following two unique features:
Co-Attention: We propose a novel mechanism that jointly reasons about visual attention and question
attention  which we refer to as co-attention. Unlike previous works  which only focus on visual
attention  our model has a natural symmetry between the image and question  in the sense that the
image representation is used to guide the question attention and the question representation(s) are
used to guide image attention.
Question Hierarchy: We build a hierarchical architecture that co-attends to the image and question
at three levels: (a) word level  (b) phrase level and (c) question level. At the word level  we embed the
words to a vector space through an embedding matrix. At the phrase level  1-dimensional convolution
neural networks are used to capture the information contained in unigrams  bigrams and trigrams.

Figure 1: Flowchart of our proposed hierarchical co-attention model. Given a question  we extract its word
level  phrase level and question level embeddings. At each level  we apply co-attention on both the image and
question. The ﬁnal answer prediction is based on all the co-attended image and question features.

Speciﬁcally  we convolve word representations with temporal ﬁlters of varying support  and then
combine the various n-gram responses by pooling them into a single phrase level representation. At
the question level  we use recurrent neural networks to encode the entire question. For each level
of the question representation in this hierarchy  we construct joint question and image co-attention
maps  which are then combined recursively to ultimately predict a distribution over the answers.
Overall  the main contributions of our work are:

• We propose a novel co-attention mechanism for VQA that jointly performs question-guided
visual attention and image-guided question attention. We explore this mechanism with two
strategies  parallel and alternating co-attention  which are described in Sec. 3.3;
• We propose a hierarchical architecture to represent the question  and consequently construct
image-question co-attention maps at 3 different levels: word level  phrase level and question
level. These co-attended features are then recursively combined from word level to question
level for the ﬁnal answer prediction;
• At the phrase level  we propose a novel convolution-pooling strategy to adaptively select the
• Finally  we evaluate our proposed model on two large datasets  VQA [2] and COCO-QA [15].

phrase sizes whose representations are passed to the question level representation;

We also perform ablation studies to quantify the roles of different components in our model.

2 Related Work

Many recent works [2  6  11  14  15  25] have proposed models for VQA. We compare and relate our
proposed co-attention mechanism to other vision and language attention mechanisms in literature.
Image attention.
Instead of directly using the holistic entire-image embedding from the fully
connected layer of a deep CNN (as in [2  13–15])  a number of recent works have explored image
attention models for VQA. Zhu et al. [26] add spatial attention to the standard LSTM model for
pointing and grounded QA. Andreas et al. [1] propose a compositional scheme that consists of a
language parser and a number of neural modules networks. The language parser predicts which neural
module network should be instantiated to answer the question. Some other works perform image
attention multiple times in a stacked manner. In [23]  the authors propose a stacked attention network 
which runs multiple hops to infer the answer progressively. To capture ﬁne-grained information from
the question  Xu et al. [22] propose a multi-hop image attention scheme. It aligns words to image
patches in the ﬁrst hop  and then refers to the entire question for obtaining image attention maps in
the second hop. In [18]  the authors generate image regions with object proposals and then select the
regions relevant to the question and answer choice. Xiong et al. [21] augments dynamic memory
network with a new input fusion module and retrieves an answer from an attention based GRU. In

generated by attention models for VQA. Note that all of these approaches model visual attention
alone  and do not model question attention. Moreover  [22  23] model attention sequentially  i.e.  later
attention is based on earlier attention  which is prone to error propagation. In contrast  we conduct
co-attention at three levels independently.
Language Attention. Though no prior work has explored question attention in VQA  there are
some related works in natural language processing (NLP) in general that have modeled language
attention. In order to overcome difﬁculty in translation of long sentences  Bahdanau et al. [3]
propose RNNSearch to learn an alignment over the input sentences. In [8]  the authors propose an
attention model to circumvent the bottleneck caused by ﬁxed width hidden vector in text reading and
comprehension. A more ﬁne-grained attention mechanism is proposed in [16]. The authors employ
a word-by-word neural attention mechanism to reason about the entailment in two sentences. Also
focused on modeling sentence pairs  the authors in [24] propose an attention-based bigram CNN for
jointly performing attention between two CNN hierarchies. In their work  three attention schemes are
proposed and evaluated. In [17]  the authors propose a two-way attention mechanism to project the
paired inputs into a common representation space.

3 Method
We begin by introducing the notation used in this paper. To ease understanding  our full model
is described in parts. First  our hierarchical question representation is described in Sec. 3.2 and
the proposed co-attention mechanism is then described in Sec. 3.3. Finally  Sec. 3.4 shows how to
recursively combine the attended question and image features to output answers.

3.1 Notation
Given a question with T words  its representation is denoted by Q = {q1  . . . qT}  where qt is the
feature vector for the t-th word. We denote qw
t as word embedding  phrase embedding and
question embedding at position t  respectively. The image feature is denoted by V = {v1  ...  vN} 
where vn is the feature vector at the spatial location n. The co-attention features of image and
question at each level in the hierarchy are denoted as ˆvr and ˆqr where r ∈ {w  p  s}. The weights in
different modules/layers are denoted with W   with appropriate sub/super-scripts as necessary. In the
exposition that follows  we omit the bias term b to avoid notational clutter.

t and qs

t   qp

3.2 Question Hierarchy
Given the 1-hot encoding of the question words Q = {q1  . . .   qT}  we ﬁrst embed the words to
a vector space (learnt end-to-end) to get Qw = {qw
T }. To compute the phrase features 
we apply 1-D convolution on the word embedding vectors. Concretely  at each word location  we
compute the inner product of the word vectors with ﬁlters of three window sizes: unigram  bigram
and trigram. For the t-th word  the convolution output with window size s is given by

1   . . .   qw

s ∈ {1  2  3}

c qw

ˆqp
s t = tanh(W s

(1)
where W s
c is the weight parameters. The word-level features Qw are appropriately 0-padded before
feeding into bigram and trigram convolutions to maintain the length of the sequence after convolution.
Given the convolution result  we then apply max-pooling across different n-grams at each word
location to obtain phrase-level features

Our pooling method differs from those used in previous works [9] in that it adaptively selects different
gram features at each time step  while preserving the original sequence length and order. We use a
LSTM to encode the sequence qp

3.3 Co-Attention

We propose two co-attention mechanisms that differ in the order in which image and question
attention maps are generated. The ﬁrst mechanism  which we call parallel co-attention  generates

3

Figure 2: (a) Parallel co-attention mechanism; (b) Alternating co-attention mechanism.

image and question attention simultaneously. The second mechanism  which we call alternating
co-attention  sequentially alternates between generating image and question attentions. See Fig. 2.
These co-attention mechanisms are executed at all three levels of the question hierarchy.
Parallel Co-Attention. Parallel co-attention attends to the image and question simultaneously.
Similar to [22]  we connect the image and question by calculating the similarity between image and
question features at all pairs of image-locations and question-locations. Speciﬁcally  given an image
feature map V ∈ Rd×N   and the question representation Q ∈ Rd×T   the afﬁnity matrix C ∈ RT×N
is calculated by

C = tanh(QT WbV )

(3)
where Wb ∈ Rd×d contains the weights. After computing this afﬁnity matrix  one possible way of
computing the image (or question) attention is to simply maximize out the afﬁnity over the locations
of other modality  i.e. av[n] = maxi(Ci n) and aq[t] = maxj(Ct j). Instead of choosing the max
activation  we ﬁnd that performance is improved if we consider this afﬁnity matrix as a feature and
learn to predict image and question attention maps via the following

H v = tanh(WvV + (WqQ)C)  H q = tanh(WqQ + (WvV )CT )

av = softmax(wT

(4)
where Wv  Wq ∈ Rk×d  whv  whq ∈ Rk are the weight parameters. av ∈ RN and aq ∈ RT are
the attention probabilities of each image region vn and word qt respectively. The afﬁnity matrix C
transforms question attention space to image attention space (vice versa for CT ). Based on the above
attention weights  the image and question attention vectors are calculated as the weighted sum of the
image features and question features  i.e. 

hvH v)  aq = softmax(wT

hqH q)

N(cid:88)

n=1

T(cid:88)

t=1

ˆv =

av
nvn 

ˆq =

aq
t qt

(5)

The parallel co-attention is done at each level in the hierarchy  leading to ˆvr and ˆqr where r ∈
{w  p  s}.
Alternating Co-Attention. In this attention mechanism  we sequentially alternate between gen-
erating image and question attention. Brieﬂy  this consists of three steps (marked in Fig. 2b): 1)
summarize the question into a single vector q; 2) attend to the image based on the question summary
q; 3) attend to the question based on the attended image feature.
Concretely  we deﬁne an attention operation ˆx = A(X; g)  which takes the image (or question)
features X and attention guidance g derived from question (or image) as inputs  and outputs the
attended image (or question) vector. The operation can be expressed in the following steps

H = tanh(WxX + (Wgg)1T )
ax = softmax(wT

where 1 is a vector with all elements to be 1. Wx  Wg ∈ Rk×d and whx ∈ Rk are parameters. ax
is the attention weight of feature X.
The alternating co-attention process is illustrated in Fig. 2 (b). At the ﬁrst step of alternating co-
attention  X = Q  and g is 0; At the second step  X = V where V is the image features  and the
guidance g is intermediate attended question feature ˆs from the ﬁrst step; Finally  we use the attended
image feature ˆv as the guidance to attend the question again  i.e.  X = Q and g = ˆv. Similar to the
parallel co-attention  the alternating co-attention is also done at each level of the hierarchy.

3.4 Encoding for Predicting Answers

Following [2]  we treat VQA as a classiﬁcation task. We predict the answer based on the co-
attended image and question features from all three levels. We use a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to
recursively encode the attention features as shown in Fig. 3(b).
hw = tanh(Ww(ˆqw + ˆvw))
hp = tanh(Wp[(ˆqp + ˆvp)  hw])
hs = tanh(Ws[(ˆqs + ˆvs)  hp])
p = softmax(Whhs)

(7)

where Ww  Wp  Ws and Wh are the weight parameters. [·] is the concatenation operation on two
vectors. p is the probability of the ﬁnal answer.

4 Experiment
4.1 Datasets

We evaluate the proposed model on two datasets  the VQA dataset [2] and the COCO-QA dataset
[15].
VQA dataset [2] is the largest dataset for this problem  containing human annotated questions and
answers on Microsoft COCO dataset [12]. The dataset contains 248 349 training questions  121 512
validation questions  244 302 testing questions  and a total of 6 141 630 question-answers pairs.
There are three sub-categories according to answer-types including yes/no  number  and other. Each
question has 10 free-response answers. We use the top 1000 most frequent answers as the possible
outputs similar to [2]. This set of answers covers 86.54% of the train+val answers. For testing  we
train our model on VQA train+val and report the test-dev and test-standard results from the VQA
evaluation server. We use the evaluation protocol of [2] in the experiment.
COCO-QA dataset [15] is automatically generated from captions in the Microsoft COCO dataset
[12]. There are 78 736 train questions and 38 948 test questions in the dataset. These questions
are based on 8 000 and 4 000 images respectively. There are four types of questions including
object  number  color  and location. Each type takes 70%  7%  17%  and 6% of the whole dataset 
respectively. All answers in this data set are single word. As in [15]  we report classiﬁcation accuracy
as well as Wu-Palmer similarity (WUPS) in Table 2.

We use Torch [4] to develop our model. We use the Rmsprop optimizer with a base learning rate
of 4e-4  momentum 0.99 and weight-decay 1e-8. We set batch size to be 300 and train for up to
256 epochs with early stopping if the validation accuracy has not improved in the last 5 epochs. For
COCO-QA  the size of hidden layer Ws is set to 512 and 1024 for VQA since it is a much larger
dataset. All the other word embedding and hidden layers were vectors of size 512. We apply dropout
with probability 0.5 on each layer. Following [23]  we rescale the image to 448 × 448  and then take
the activation from the last pooling layer of VGGNet [19] or ResNet [7] as its feature.

4.3 Results and Analysis

There are two test scenarios on VQA: open-ended and multiple-choice. The best performing method
deeper LSTM Q + norm I from [2] is used as our baseline. For open-ended test scenario  we
compare our method with the recent proposed SMem [22]  SAN [23]  FDA [10] and DMN+ [21].
For multiple choice  we compare with Region Sel.
[18] and FDA [10]. We compare with 2-
VIS+BLSTM [15]  IMG-CNN [13] and SAN [23] on COCO-QA. We use Oursp to refer to our
parallel co-attention  Oursa for alternating co-attention.
Table 1 shows results on the VQA test sets for both open-ended and multiple-choice settings. We can
see that our approach improves the state of art from 60.4% (DMN+ [21]) to 62.1% (Oursa+ResNet) on
open-ended and from 64.2% (FDA [10]) to 66.1% (Oursa+ResNet) on multiple-choice. Notably  for
the question type Other and Num  we achieve 3.4% and 1.4% improvement on open-ended questions 
and 4.0% and 1.1% on multiple-choice questions. As we can see  ResNet features outperform or
match VGG features in all cases. Our improvements are not solely due to the use of a better CNN.
Speciﬁcally  FDA [10] also uses ResNet [7]  but Oursa+ResNet outperforms it by 1.8% on test-dev.
SMem [22] uses GoogLeNet [20] and the rest all use VGGNet [19]  and Ours+VGG outperforms
them by 0.2% on test-dev (DMN+ [21]).
Table 2 shows results on the COCO-QA test set. Similar to the result on VQA  our model improves the
state-of-the-art from 61.6% (SAN(2 CNN) [23]) to 65.4% (Oursa+ResNet). We observe that parallel
co-attention performs better than alternating co-attention in this setup. Both attention mechanisms
have their advantages and disadvantages: parallel co-attention is harder to train because of the dot
product between image and text which compresses two vectors into a single value. On the other hand 
alternating co-attention may suffer from errors being accumulated at each round.

4.4 Ablation Study

In this section  we perform ablation studies to quantify the role of each component in our model.
Speciﬁcally  we re-train our approach by ablating certain components:

• Image Attention alone  where in a manner similar to previous works [23]  we do not use any
question attention. The goal of this comparison is to verify that our improvements are not the
result of orthogonal contributions. (say better optimization or better CNN features).

with a uniform distribution. Phrase and question level co-attentions are still modeled.

(test sets are not recommended to be used for such experiments). The deeper LSTM Q + norm I
baseline in [2] is also reported for comparison. We can see that image-attention-alone does improve
performance over the holistic image feature (deeper LSTM Q + norm I)  which is consistent with
ﬁndings of previous attention models for VQA [21  23].
Comparing the full model w.r.t. ablated versions
without word  phrase  question level attentions re-
veals a clear interesting trend – the attention mech-
anisms closest to the ‘top’ of the hierarchy (i.e. ques-
tion) matter most  with a drop of 1.7% in accuracy
if not modeled; followed by the intermediate level
(i.e. phrase)  with a drop of 0.3%; ﬁnally followed
by the ‘bottom’ of the hierarchy (i.e. word)  with
a drop of 0.2% in accuracy. We hypothesize that
this is because the question level is the ‘closest’ to
the answer prediction layers in our model. Note
that all levels are important  and our ﬁnal model
signiﬁcantly outperforms not using any linguistic
attention (1.1% difference between Full Model and
Image Atten). The question attention alone model
is better than LSTM Q+I  with an improvement of 0.5% and worse than image attention alone  with a
drop of 1.1%. Oursa further improves if we performed alternating co-attention for one more round 
with an improvement of 0.3%.

4.5 Qualitative Results

We now visualize some co-attention maps generated by our method in Fig. 4. At the word level  our
model attends mostly to the object regions in an image  e.g.  heads  bird. At the phrase level  the
image attention has different patterns across images. For the ﬁrst two images  the attention transfers
from objects to background regions. For the third image  the attention becomes more focused on
the objects. We suspect that this is caused by the different question types. On the question side 
our model is capable of localizing the key phrases in the question  thus essentially discovering the
question types in the dataset. For example  our model pays attention to the phrases “what color” and
“how many snowboarders”. Our model successfully attends to the regions in images and phrases in the
questions appropriate for answering the question  e.g.  “color of the bird” and bird region. Because

Figure 4: Visualization of image and question co-attention maps on the COCO-QA dataset. From left to right:
original image and question pairs  word level co-attention maps  phrase level co-attention maps and question
level co-attention maps. For visualization  both image and question attentions are scaled (from red:high to
blue:low). Best viewed in color.

our model performs co-attention at three levels  it often captures complementary information from
each level  and then combines them to predict the answer.

5 Conclusion
In this paper  we proposed a hierarchical co-attention model for visual question answering. Co-
attention allows our model to attend to different regions of the image as well as different fragments
of the question. We model the question hierarchically at three levels to capture information from
different granularities. The ablation studies further demonstrate the roles of co-attention and question
hierarchy in our ﬁnal performance. Through visualizations  we can see that our model co-attends
to interpretable regions of images and questions for predicting the answer. Though our model was
evaluated on visual question answering  it can be potentially applied to other tasks involving vision
and language.
