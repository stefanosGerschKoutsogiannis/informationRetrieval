Abstract

Intelligent agents are often faced with the need to choose actions with uncertain
consequences  and to modify those actions according to ongoing sensory process-
ing and changing task demands. The requisite ability to dynamically modify or
cancel planned actions is known as inhibitory control in psychology. We formal-
ize inhibitory control as a rational decision-making problem  and apply to it to the
classical stop-signal task. Using Bayesian inference and stochastic control tools 
we show that the optimal policy systematically depends on various parameters of
the problem  such as the relative costs of different action choices  the noise level
of sensory inputs  and the dynamics of changing environmental demands. Our
normative model accounts for a range of behavioral data in humans and animals
in the stop-signal task  suggesting that the brain implements statistically optimal 
dynamically adaptive  and reward-sensitive decision-making in the context of in-
hibitory control problems.

Introduction

In natural behavior as well as in engineering applications  there is often the need to choose  under
time pressure  an action among multiple options with imprecisely known consequences. For exam-
ple  consider the decision of buying a house. A wise buyer should collect sufﬁcient data to make an
informed decision  but waiting too long might mean missing out on a dream home. Thus  balanced
against the informational gain afforded by lengthier deliberation is the opportunity cost of inaction.
Further complicating matters is the possible occurrence of a rare and unpredictably timed adverse
event  such as job loss or serious illness  that would require a dynamic reformulation of one’s plan of
action. This ability to dynamically modify or cancel a planned action that is no longer advantageous
or appropriate is known as inhibitory control in psychology.
In psychology and neuroscience  inhibitory control has been studied extensively using the stop-
signal (or countermanding) task [17]. In this task  subjects perform a simple two-alternative forced
choice (2AFC) discrimination task on a go stimulus  whereby one of two responses is required de-
pending on the stimulus. On a small fraction of trials  an additional stop signal appears after some
delay  which instructs the subject to withhold the discrimination or go response. As might be ex-
pected  the later the stop signal appears  the harder it is for subjects to stop the response [9] (see
Figure 3). The classical model of the stop-signal task is the race model [11]  which posits a race
to threshold between independent go and stop processes. It also hypothesizes a stopping latency 
the stop-signal reaction time (SSRT)  which is the delay between stop signal onset and successful
withholding of a go response. The (unobservable) SSRT is estimated as shown in Figure 1A  and is

1

thought to be longer in patient populations associated with inhibitory deﬁcit than in healthy controls
(attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder [1]  obsessive-compulsive disorder [12]  and substance de-
pendence [13]). Some evidence suggests a neural correlate of the SSRT [8  14  5]. Although the race
model is elegant in its simplicity and captures key experimental data  it is descriptive in nature and
does not address how the stopping latency and other elements of the model depend on various un-
derlying cognitive factors. Consequently  it cannot explain why behavior and stopping latency varies
systematically across different experimental conditions or across different subject populations.
We present a normative  optimal decision-making framework for inhibitory control. We formalize
interactions among various cognitive components: the continual monitoring of noisy sensory in-
formation  the integration of sensory inputs with top-down expectations  and the assessment of the
relative values of potential actions. Our model has two principal components: (1) a monitoring pro-
cess  based on Bayesian statistical inference  that infers the go stimulus identity within each trial  as
well as task parameters across trials  (2) a decision process  formalized in terms of stochastic con-
trol  that translates current belief state based on sensory inputs into a moment-by-moment valuation
of whether to choose one of the two go responses  or to wait longer. Given a certain belief state  the
relative values of the various actions depend both on experimental parameters  such as the fraction
of stop trials and the difﬁculty of go stimulus discrimination  as well as subject-speciﬁc parameters 
such as learning rate and subjective valuation of rewards and costs. Within our normative model of
inhibitory control  stopping latency is an emergent property  arising from interactions between the
monitoring and decision processes. We show that our model captures classical behavioral data in
the task  makes quantitative behavioral predictions under different experimental manipulations  and
suggests that the brain may be implementing near-optimal decision-making in the stop-signal task.

2 Sensory processing as Bayes-optimal statistical inference

We model sensory processing in the stop-signal task as Bayesian statistical inference. In the gen-
erative model (see Figure 1B for graphical model)  there are two independent hidden variables 
corresponding to the identity of the go stimulus  d ∈ {0  1}  and whether or not the current trial is
a stop trial  s ∈ {0  1}. Priors over d and s reﬂect experimental parameters: e.g. P (d = 1) = .5 
P (s = 1) = .25 in typical stop signal experiments. Conditioned on d  a stream of iid inputs are
generated on each trial  x1  . . .   xt  . . .  where t indexes small increments of time within a trial 
p(xt|d = 0) = f0(xt)  and p(xt|d = 1) = f1(xt). For simplicity  we assume f0 and f1 to be
Bernoulli distributions with distinct rate parameters qd and 1−qd  respectively. The dynamic vari-
able zt denotes the presence/absence of the stop signal: if the stop signal appears at time θ then
z1 = . . . = zθ−1 = 0 and zθ = zθ+1 = . . . = 1. On a go trial  s = 0  the stop-signal of course
never appears  P (θ = ∞) = 1. On a stop trial  s = 1  we assume for simplicity that the onset of
the stop signal follows a constant hazard rate  i.e. θ is generated from an exponential distribution:
p(θ|s = 1) = λe−λθ. Conditioned on zt  there is a separate iid stream of observations associated
with the stop signal: p(yt|zt = 0) = g0(yt)  and p(yt|zt = 1) = g1(yt). Again  we assume for
simplicity that g0 and g1 are Bernoulli distributions with distinct rate parameters qs and 1− qs 
respectively.

In the recognition model  the posterior probability associated with signal identity pt

where xt (cid:44){x1  . . .   xt} denotes all the data observed so far  can be computed via Bayes’ Rule:

Figure 1: Modeling inhibitory control in the stop-signal task. (A) shows the race model for behavior
in the stop-signal task [11]. Go and stop stimuli  separated by a stop signal delay (SSD)  initiate
two independent processes that race to thresholds and determine trial outcome. On go trials  noise
in the go process results in a broad distribution over threshold-crossing times  i.e.  the go reaction
time (RT) distribution. The stop process is typically modeled as deterministic  with an associated
stop signal reaction time or SSRT. The SSRT determines the fraction of go responses successfully
stopped: the go RT cumulative density function evaluated at SSD+SSRT should give the stopping
error rate at that SSD. Based on these assumptions  the SSRT is estimated from data given the go RT
distribution  and error rate as a function of SSD. (B) Graphical model for sensory input generation in
our Bayesian model. Two separate streams of observations  {x1  . . .   xt  . . .} and {y1  . . .   yt  . . .} 
are associated with the go and stop stimuli  respectively. xt depend on the identity of the target 
d ∈ {0  1}. yt depends on whether the current trial is a stop trial  s = {0  1}  and whether the
stop-signal has already appeared by time t  zt∈{0  1}.

where r = P (s = 1) is the prior probability of a stop trial. Note that h(t) does not depend on the
observations  since given that the stop signal has not yet appeared  whether it will appear in the next
instant does not depend on previous observations.
In the stop-signal task  a stop trial is considered a stop trial even if the subject makes the go response
early  before the stop signal is presented. Following this convention  we need to compute the pos-
s  which depends both on the current
terior probability that the current trial is a stop trial  denoted pt
belief about the presence of the stop signal  and the expectation that it will appear in the future:

s).

Finally  we deﬁne the belief state at time t to be the vector bt = (pt
Figure 2A shows the evolution of belief states for various trial types: (1) go trials  where no stop
signal appears  (2) stop error (SE) trials  where a stop signal is presented but a response is made 
and (3) stop success (SS) trials  where the stop signal is successfully processed to cancel the re-
sponse. For simplicity  only trials where d = 1 are shown  and θs on stop trials is 17 steps. Due to
stochasticity in the sensory information  the go stimulus is processed slower and the stop signal is
detected faster than average on some trials; these lead to successful stopping  with SE trials showing
the opposite trend. On all trials  ps shows an initial increase due to anticipation of the stop signal.
Parameters used for the simulation were chosen to approximate typical experimental conditions (see
e.g.  Figure 3)  and kept constant throughtout except where explicitly noted. The results do not
change qualitatively when these settings are varied (data not shown).

3 Decision making as optimal stochastic control

In order to understand behavior as optimal decision-making  we need to specify a loss function that
captures the reward structure of the task. We assume there is a deadline D for responding on go
trials  and an opportunity cost of c per unit time on each trial. In addition  there is a penalty cs
for choosing to respond on a stop-signal trial  and a unit cost for making an error on a go trial (by

3

choosing the wrong discrimination response or exceeding the deadline for responding). Because
only the relative costs matter in the optimization  we can normalize the coefﬁcients associated with
all the costs such that one of them is unit cost. Let τ denote the trial termination time  so that τ = D
if no response is made before the deadline  and τ < D if a response is made. On each trial  the policy
π produces a stopping time τ and a possible binary response δ∈{0  1}. The loss function is:

l(τ  δ; d  s  θ  D) = cτ + cs1{τ <D s=1} + 1{τ <D δ(cid:54)=d s=0} + 1{τ =D s=0}

where 1{·} is the indicator function. The optimal decision policy minimizes the average or expected
loss  Lπ (cid:44) (cid:104)l(τ  δ; d  s  D)(cid:105) 

Lπ = c(cid:104)τ(cid:105) + csrP (τ < D|s = 1) + (1−r)P (τ < D  δ(cid:54)= d|s = 0) + (1−r)P (τ = D|s = 0) .

Minimizing Lπ over the policy space directly is computationally intractable  but the dynamic pro-
gramming principle provides an iterative relationship  the optimality equation  in terms of the value
function (deﬁned in terms of costs here)  V t(bt)

w on V t+1 allows us to recursively compute the value function backwards in time. Given V t+1 
of Qt
we can compute (cid:104)V t+1(cid:105) by summing over the uncertainty about the next observations xt+1  yt+1 
since the belief state bt+1 is a deterministic function of bt and the observations.

The initial condition of the value function can be computed exactly at the deadline since there is only
one outcome (subject is no longer allowed to go or stop): V D(bD) = cD + (1 − pD
s ). We can then

compute {V t}D

to t = 1. In our simulations  we do so numerically by discretizing the probability space for pt
1000 bins; pt
d is represented exactly using its sufﬁcient statistics. Note that dynamic programming
is merely a convenient tool for computing the exact optimal policy. Our results show that humans
and animals behave in a manner consistent with the optimal policy  indicating that the brain must
use computations that are similar in nature. The important question of how such a policy may be
computed or approximated neurally will be explored in future work.
Figure 2B demonstrates graphically how the Q-factors Qg  Qw evolve over time for the trial types
indicated in Figure 2A. Reﬂecting the sensory processing differences  SS trials show a slower drop
in the cost of going  and a faster increase after the stop signal is processed; this is the converse
of stop error trials. Note that although the average trajectory Qg does not dip below Qw in the
non-canceled (error) stop trials  there is substantial variability in the individual trajectories under a
Bernoulli observation model  and each one of them dips below Qw at some point. The histograms
show reaction time distributions for go and SE trials.

4 Results

4.1 Model captures classical behavioral data in the stop-signal task

We ﬁrst show that our model captures the basic behavioral results characteristic of the stop-signal
task. Figure 3 compares our model predictions to data from Macaque monkeys performing a version

each individual trajectory crosses over at various time points  as indicated by the RT histograms.

which is equivalent to assuming that the cost of time (opportunity cost) should be set by the reward
rate. Unless otherwise stated  these parameters are used in all the subsequent simulations. Thickness

of the stop-signal task [9]. One of the basic measures of performance is the inhibition function 
which is the average error rate on stop trials as a function of SSD. Error increases as SSD increases 
as shown in the monkeys’ behavior and also in our model (Figure 3A;B). Another classical result
in the stop-signal task is that RT’s on non-canceled (error) stop trials are on average faster than
those on go trials (Figure 3C). Our model also reproduces this result (Figure 3D). Intuitively  this
is because inference about the go stimulus identity can proceed slowly or rapidly on different trials 
due to noise in the observation process. Non-canceled trials are those in which pd happens to evolve
rapidly enough for a go response to be initiated before the stop signal is adequately processed. Go
trial RT’s  on the other hand  include all trajectories  whether pd happens to evolve quickly or not
(see Figure 2).

4.2 Effect of stop trial frequency on behavior

The overall frequency of stop signal trials has systematic effects on stopping behavior [6]. As the
fraction of stop trials is increased  go responses slow down and stop errors decrease in a graded
fashion (Figure 4A;B). In our model (Figure 4C;D)  the stop signal frequency  r  inﬂuences the
speed with which a stop signal is detected  whereby larger r leads to greater posterior belief that
a stop signal is present  and also greater conﬁdence that a stop signal will appear soon even it has
not already. It therefore controls the tradeoff between going and stopping in the optimal policy. If
stop signals are more prevalent  the optimal decision policy can use that information to make fewer
errors on stop trials  by delaying the go response  and by detecting the stop signal faster.
Even in experiments where the fraction of stop trials is held constant  chance runs of stop or go
trials may result in ﬂuctuating local frequency of stop trials  which in turn may lead to trial-by-trial
behavioral adjustments due to subjects’ ﬂuctuating estimate of r. Indeed  subjects speed up after
a chance run of go trials  and slow down following a sequence of stop trials [6] (see Figure 4E).
We model these effects by assuming that subjects believe that the stop signal frequency rk on trial
k has probability α of being the same as rk−1 and probability 1 − α of being re-sampled from a
prior distribution p0(r)  chosen in our simulations to be a beta distribution with a bias toward small
r (infrequent stop trials). Previous work has shown that this is essentially equivalent to using a
causal  exponential window to estimate the current rate of stop trials [20]  where the exponential
decay constant is monotonically related to the assumed volatility in the environment in the Bayesian
model. The probability of trial k being a stop trial  P (sk = 1|sk−1)  where sk (cid:44){s1  . . .   sk}  is
rkp(rk|sk−1)drk = (cid:104)rk|sk−1(cid:105) .

P (sk = 1|rk)p(rk|sk−1)drk =

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

P (sk = 1|sk−1) =

In other words  the predictive probability of seeing a stop trial is just the mean of the predictive
distribution p(rk|sk−1). We denote this mean as ˆrk. The predictive distribution is a mixture of the
previous posterior distribution and a ﬁxed prior distribution  with α and 1−α acting as the mixing
coefﬁcients  respectively:

p(rk|sk−1) = αp(rk−1|sk−1) + (1 − α)p0(rk)

and the posterior distribution is updated according to Bayes’ Rule:
p(rk|sk) ∝ P (sk|rk)p(rk|sk−1) .

As shown in Figure 4F  our model successfully explains observed sequential effects in behavioral
data. Since the majority of trials (75%) are go trials  a chance run of go trials impacts RT much
less than a chance run of stop trials. The ﬁgure also shows results for different values of α  with all
other parameters kept constant. These values encode different expectations about volatility in the
stop trial frequency  and produce slightly different predictions about sequential effects. Thus  α may
be an important source of individual variability observed in the data  along with the other model
parameters.
Recent data shows that neural activity in the supplementary eye ﬁeld is predictive of trial-by-trial
slowing as a function of the recent stop trial frequency [15]. Moreover  microstimulation of supple-
mentary eye ﬁeld neurons results in slower responses to the go stimulus and fewer stop errors [16].
Together  this suggests that supplementary eye ﬁeld may encode the local frequency of stop trials 
and inﬂuence stopping behavior in a statistically appropriate manner.

4.3

Inﬂuence of reward structure on behavior

The previous section demonstrated how adjustments to behavior in the face of experimental manip-
ulations can be seen as instances of optimal decision-making in the stop signal task. An important
component of the race model for stopping behavior [11] is the SSRT  which is thought to be a stable 
subject-speciﬁc index of stopping ability. In this section  we demonstrate that the SSRT can be seen
as an emergent property of optimal decision-making  and is consequently modiﬁed in predictable
ways by experimental manipulation.
Leotti & Wager showed that subjects can be biased toward stopping or going when the relative
penalties associated with go and stop errors are experimentally manipulated [10]. Figure 5A;B
show that as subjects are biased toward stopping  they make fewer stop trial errors and have slower

go responses. Our model reproduces this behavior when cs  the parameter representing the cost of
stopping  is set to small  medium and high values. Increasing the cost of a stop error induces an
increase in reaction time and an associated decrease in the fraction of stop errors. This is a direct
consequence of the optimal model attempting to minimize the total expected cost – with stop errors
being more expensive  there is an incentive to slow down the go response in order to minimize the
possibility of missing a stop signal.
Critically  the SSRT in the human data decreases with increasing bias toward stopping (Figure 5C).
Although the SSRT is not an explicit component of our model  we can nevertheless estimate it from
the reaction times and fraction of stop errors produced by our model simulations  following the race
model’s prescribed procedure [11]. Essentially  the SSRT is estimated as the difference between
mean go RT and the SSD at which 50% stop errors are committed (see Figure 1). By reconciling
the competing demands of stopping and going in an optimal manner  the estimated SSRT from
our simulations is automatically adjusted to mimic the observed human behavior (Figure 5F). This
suggests that the SSRT emerges naturally out of rational decision-making in the task.

5 Discussion

We presented an optimal decision-making model for inhibitory control in the stop-signal task. The
parameters of the model are either set directly by experimental design (cost function  stop frequency
and timing)  or correspond to subject-speciﬁc abilities that can be estimated from behavior (sensory
processing); thus  there are no “free” parameters. The model successfully captures classical behav-
ioral results  such as the increase in error rate on stop trials with the increase of SSD  as well as the
decreases in average response time from go trials to error stop trials. The model also captures more
subtle changes in stopping behavior  when the fraction of stop-signal trials  the penalties for various
types of errors  and the history of experienced trials are manipulated. The classical model for the task

Figure 5: Effect of reward on stopping. (A-C) Data from human subjects performing a variant of
the stop-signal task where the ratio of rewards for quick go responses and successful stopping was
varied  inducing a bias towards going or stopping (Data from [10]). An increased bias towards
stopping (i.e.  fewer stop errors  (A)) is associated with an increase in the average reaction time on
go trials (B)  and a decrease in the stopping latency or SSRT (C). (D-F) Our model captures this
change in SSRT as a function of the inherent tradeoff between RT and stop errors. Values of cs:

(the race model) does not directly explain or quantitatively predict these changes in behavior. More-
over  the stopping latency measure prescribed by the race model (the SSRT) changes systematically
across various experimental manipulations  indicating that it cannot be used as a simplistic  global
measure of inhibitory control for each subject. Instead  inhibitory control is a multifaceted function
of factors such as subject-speciﬁc sensory processing rates  attentional factors  and internal/external
bias towards stopping or going  which are explicitly related to parameters in our normative model.
The close correspondence of model predictions with human and animal behavior suggests that the
computations necessary for optimal behavior are exactly or approximately implemented by the brain.
We used dynamic programming as a convenient tool to compute the optimal monitoring and deci-
sional computations  but the brain is unlikely to use this computationally expensive method. Recent
studies of the frontal eye ﬁelds (FEF  [8]) and superior colliculus [14] of monkeys show neural re-
sponses that diverge on go and correct stop trials  indicating that they may encode computations
leading to the execution or cancellation of movement. It is possible that optimal behavior can be
approximated by a diffusion process implementing the race model [4  19]  with the rate and thresh-
old parameters adjusted according to task demands. In future work  we will study more explicitly
how optimal decision-making can be approximated by a diffusion model implementation of the
race model (see e.g.  [18]  and how the parameters of such an implementation may be set to reﬂect
task demands. We will also assess alternatives to the race model  in the form of other approximate
algorithms  in terms of their ability to capture behavioral data and explain neural data.
One major aim of our work is to understand how stopping ability and SSRT arise from various
cognitive factors  such as sensitivity to rewards  learning capacity related to estimating stop signal
frequency  and the rate at which sensory inputs are processed. This composite view of stopping
ability and SSRT may help explain group differences in stopping behavior  in particular  differences
in SSRT observed in a number of psychiatric and neurological conditions  such as substance abuse
[13]  attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder [1]  schizophrenia [3]  obsessive-compulsive disorder
[12]  Parkinson’s disease [7]  Alzheimer’s disease [2]  et cetera. One of our goals for future research
is to map group differences in stopping behavior to the parameters of our model  thus gaining insight
into exactly which cognitive components go awry in each dysfunctional state.
