Abstract

Variational autoencoders (VAE) are a powerful and widely-used class of models
to learn complex data distributions in an unsupervised fashion. One important
limitation of VAEs is the prior assumption that latent sample representations are in-
dependent and identically distributed. However  for many important datasets  such
as time-series of images  this assumption is too strong: accounting for covariances
between samples  such as those in time  can yield to a more appropriate model
speciﬁcation and improve performance in downstream tasks. In this work  we
introduce a new model  the Gaussian Process (GP) Prior Variational Autoencoder
(GPPVAE)  to speciﬁcally address this issue. The GPPVAE aims to combine the
power of VAEs with the ability to model correlations afforded by GP priors. To
achieve efﬁcient inference in this new class of models  we leverage structure in
the covariance matrix  and introduce a new stochastic backpropagation strategy
that allows for computing stochastic gradients in a distributed and low-memory
fashion. We show that our method outperforms conditional VAEs (CVAEs) and an
adaptation of standard VAEs in two image data applications.

Introduction

Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental approach to compression of complex  large-scale data
sets  either for visualization or for pre-processing before application of supervised approaches.
Historically  dimensionality reduction has been framed in one of two modeling camps: the simple and
rich capacity language of neural networks; or the probabilistic formalism of generative models  which
enables Bayesian capacity control and provides uncertainty over latent encodings. Recently  these
two formulations have been combined through the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma and
Welling  2013)  wherein the expressiveness of neural networks was used to model both the mean and
the variance of a simple likelihood. In these models  latent encodings are assumed to be identically
and independently distributed (iid ) across both latent dimensions and samples. Despite this simple
prior  the model lacks conjugacy  exact inference is intractable and variational inference is used. In
fact  the main contribution of the Kingma et al. paper is to introduce an improved  general approach
for variational inference (also developed in Rezende et al. (2014)).
One important limitation of the VAE model is the prior assumption that latent representations of
samples are iid   whereas in many important problems  accounting for sample structure is crucial
for correct model speciﬁcation and consequently  for optimal results. For example  in autonomous
driving  or medical imaging (Dalca et al.  2015; Lonsdale et al.  2013)  high dimensional images are
correlated in time—an iid prior for these would not be sensible because  a priori  two images that
were taken closer in time should have more similar latent representations than images taken further
apart. More generally  one can have multiple sequences of images from different cars  or medical

image sequences from multiple patients. Therefore  the VAE prior should be able to capture multiple
levels of correlations at once  including time  object identities  etc. A natural solution to this problem
is to replace the VAE iid prior over the latent space with a Gaussian Process (GP) prior (Rasmussen 
2004)  which enables the speciﬁcation of sample correlations through a kernel function (Durrande
et al.  2011; Gönen and Alpaydın  2011; Wilson and Adams  2013; Wilson et al.  2016; Rakitsch
et al.  2013; Bonilla et al.  2007). GPs are often amenable to exact inference  and a large body of work
in making computationally challenging GP-based models tractable can be leveraged (GPs naively
scale cubically in the number of samples) (Gal et al.  2014; Bauer et al.  2016; Hensman et al.  2013;
Csató and Opper  2002; Quiñonero-Candela and Rasmussen  2005; Titsias  2009).
In this work  we introduce the Gaussian Process Prior Variational Autoencoder (GPPVAE)  an
extension of the VAE latent variable model where correlation between samples is modeled through a
GP prior on the latent encodings. The introduction of the GP prior  however  introduces two main
computational challenges. First  naive computations with the GP prior have cubic complexity in
the number of samples  which is impractical in most applications. To mitigate this problem one can
leverage several tactics commonly used in the GP literature  including the use of pseudo-inputs (Csató
and Opper  2002; Gal et al.  2014; Hensman et al.  2013; Quiñonero-Candela and Rasmussen  2005;
Titsias  2009)  Kronecker-factorized covariances (Casale et al.  2017; Stegle et al.  2011; Rakitsch
et al.  2013)  and low rank structures (Casale et al.  2015; Lawrence  2005). Speciﬁcally  in the
instantiations of GPPVAE considered in this paper  we focus on low-rank factorizations of the
covariance matrix. A second challenge is that the iid assumption which guarantees unbiasedness
of mini-batch gradient estimates (used to train standard VAEs) no longer holds due to the GP
prior. Thus mini-batch GD is no longer applicable. However  for the applications we are interested
in  comprising sequences of large-scale images  it is critical from a practical standpoint to avoid
processing all samples simultaneously; we require a procedure that is both low in memory use and
yields fast inference. Thus  we propose a new scheme for gradient descent that enables Monte Carlo
gradient estimates in a distributable and memory-efﬁcient fashion. This is achieved by exploiting
the fact that sample correlations are only modeled in the latent (low-dimensional) space  whereas
high-dimensional representations are independent when conditioning on the latent ones.
In the next sections we (i) discuss our model in the context of related work  (ii) formally develop
the model and the associated inference procedure  (iii) compare GPPVAE with alternative models in
empirical settings  demonstrating the advantages of our approach.

2 Related work

Our method is related to several extensions of the standard VAE that aim at improving the latent
representation by leveraging auxiliary data  such as time annotations  pose information or lighting.
An ad hoc attempt to induce structure on the latent space by grouping samples with speciﬁc properties
in mini-batches was introduced in Kulkarni et al. (2015). More principled approaches proposed
a semi-supervised model using a continuous-discrete mixture model that concatenates the input
with auxiliary information (Kingma et al.  2014). Similarly  the conditional VAE (Sohn et al.  2015)
incorporates auxiliary information in both the encoder and the decoder  and has been used successfully
for sample generation with speciﬁc categorical attributes. Building on this approach  several models
use the auxiliary information in an unconditional way (Suzuki et al.  2016; Pandey and Dukkipati 
2017; Vedantam et al.  2017; Wang et al.  2016; Wu and Goodman  2018).
A separate body of related work aims at designing a more ﬂexible variational posterior distributions 
either by considering a dependence on auxiliary variables (Maaløe et al.  2016)  by allowing structured
encoder models (Siddharth et al.  2016)  or by considering chains of invertible transformations that
can produce arbitrarily complex posteriors (Kingma et al.  2016; Nalisnick et al.  2016; Rezende
and Mohamed  2015). In other work  a dependency between latent variables is induced by way of
hierarchical structures at the level of the parameters of the variational family (Ranganath et al.  2016;
Tran et al.  2015).
The extensions of VAEs most related to GPPVAE are those that move away from the assumption of
an iid Gaussian prior on the latent representations to consider richer prior distributions (Jiang et al. 
2016; Shu et al.  2016; Tomczak and Welling  2017). These build on the observation that overly-
simple priors can induce excessive regularization  limiting the success of such models (Chen et al. 
2016; Hoffman and Johnson  2016; Siddharth et al.  2017). For example  Johnson et al. proposed

composing latent graphical models with deep observational likelihoods. Within their framework  more
ﬂexible priors over latent encodings are designed based on conditional independence assumptions 
and a conditional random ﬁeld variational family is used to enable efﬁcient inference by way of
message-passing algorithms (Johnson et al.  2016).
In contrast to existing methods  we propose to model the relationship between the latent space
and the auxiliary information using a GP prior  leaving the encoder and decoder as in a standard
VAE (independent of the auxiliary information). Importantly  the proposed approach allows for
modeling arbitrarily complex sample structure in the data. In this work  we speciﬁcally focus on
disentangling sample correlations induced by different aspects of the data. Additionally  GPPVAE en-
ables estimation of latent auxiliary information when such information is unobserved by leveraging
previous work (Lawrence  2005). Finally  using the encoder and decoder networks together with the
GP predictive posterior  our model provides a natural framework for out-of-sample predictions of
high-dimensional data  for virtually any conﬁguration of the auxiliary data.

3 Gaussian Process Prior Variational Autoencoder

Assume we are given a set of samples (e. g.  images)  each coupled with different types of auxiliary
data (e. g.  time  lighting  pose  person identity). In this work  we focus on the case of two types of
auxiliary data: object and view entities. Speciﬁcally  we consider datasets with images of objects
in different views. For example  images of faces in different poses or images of hand-written digits
at different rotation angles. In these problems  we know both which object (person or hand-written
digit) is represented in each image in the dataset  and in which view (pose or rotation angle). Finally 
each unique object and view is attached to a feature vector  which we refer to as an object feature
vector and a view feature vector  respectively. In the face dataset example  object feature vectors
might contain face features such as skin color or hair style  while view feature vectors may contain
pose features such as polar and azimuthal angles with respect to a reference position. Importantly  as
described and shown below  we can learn these feature vectors if not observed.

3.1 Formal description of the model

Let N denote the number of samples  P the number of unique objects and Q the number of
unique views. Additionally  let {yn}N

let {xp}P
q=1 denote
R-dimensional view feature vectors for the Q views. Finally  let {zn}N
n=1 denote the L-dimensional
latent representations. We consider the following generative process for the observed samples (Fig
1a):

• the latent representation of object pn in view qn is generated from object feature vector xpn

and view feature vector wqn as

• image yn is generated from its latent representation zn as

zn = f (xpn   wqn ) + ηn  where ηn ∼ N (0  αIL) ;

The function f : RM × RR → RL deﬁnes how sample latent representations can be obtained in
terms of object and view feature vectors  while g : RL → RK maps latent representations to the
high-dimensional sample space.
We use a Gaussian process (GP) prior on f  which allows us to model sample covariances in the
latent space as a function of object and view feature vectors. Herein  we use a convolutional neural
network for g  which is a natural choice for image data (LeCun et al.  1995). The resulting marginal
likelihood of the GPPVAE  is

where zl denotes the l-th column of Z. In the setting considered in this paper  the covariance
function Kθ is composed of a view kernel that models covariances between views  and an object
kernel that models covariances between objects. Speciﬁcally  the covariance between sample n (with
corresponding feature vectors xpn and wqn) and sample m (with corresponding feature vectors xpm
and wqm) is given by the factorized form (Bonilla et al.  2007; Rakitsch et al.  2013):

Observed versus unobserved feature vectors Our model can be used when either one  or both of
the view/sample feature vectors are unobserved. In this setting  we regard the unobserved features
as latent variables and obtain a point estimate for them  similar to Gaussian process latent variable
models (Lawrence  2005). We have done so in our experiments.

Inference

As with a standard VAE  we make use of variational inference for our model. Speciﬁcally  we
consider the following variational distribution over the latent variables

Efﬁcient GP computations. Naive computations in Gaussian processes scale cubically with the
number of samples (Rasmussen  2004). In this work  we achieve linear computations in the number
of samples by assuming that the overall GP kernel is low-rank. In order to meet this assumption  we (i)
exploit that in our setting the number of views  Q  is much lower than the number of samples  N  and
(ii) impose a low-rank form for the object kernel (M (cid:28) N). Brieﬂy  as a result of these assumptions 
the total covariance is the sum of a low-rank matrix and the identity matrix K = V V T + αI 
where V ∈ RN×H and H (cid:28) N 1. For this covariance  computation of the inverse and the log
determinant  which have cubic complexity for general covariances  can be recast to have complexity 
O(N H 2 + H 3 + HN K) and O(N H 2 + H 3)  respectively  using the Woodbury identity (Henderson
and Searle  1981) and the determinant lemma (Harville  1997):

Low-memory stochastic backpropagation. Owing to the coupling between samples from the
GP prior  mini-batch gradient descent is no longer applicable. However  a naive implementation
of full gradient descent is impractical as it requires loading the entire dataset into memory  which
is infeasible with most image datasets. To overcome this limitation  we propose a new strategy
to compute gradients on the whole dataset in a low-memory fashion. We do so by computing the
ﬁrst-order Taylor series expansion of the GP term of the loss with respect to both the latent encodings
and the prior parameters  at each step of gradient descent. In doing so  we are able to use the following
procedure:

1. Compute latent encodings from the high-dimensional data using the encoder. This step can

be performed in data mini-batches  thereby imposing only low-memory requirements.

2. Compute the coefﬁcients of the GP-term Taylor series expansion using the latent encodings.
Although this step involves computations across all samples  these have low-memory
requirements as they only involve the low-dimensional representations.

3. Compute a proxy loss by replacing the GP term by its ﬁrst-order Taylor series expansion 
which locally has the same gradient as the original loss. Since the Taylor series expansion
is linear in the latent representations  gradients can be easily accumulated across data
mini-batches  making this step also memory-efﬁcient.

if both the view and the object kernels are linear  we have V

=

[X: 1 (cid:12) W: 1  X: 1 (cid:12) W: 2  . . .   X: M (cid:12) W: Q] ∈ RN×H.

4. Update the parameters using these accumulated gradients.

Full details on this procedure are given in Supplementary Information.

3.3 Predictive posterior

We derive an approximate predictive posterior for GPPVAE that enables out-of-sample predictions
of high-dimensional samples. Speciﬁcally  given training samples Y   object feature vectors X  and
view feature vectors W   the predictive posterior for image representation y(cid:63) of object p(cid:63) in view q(cid:63)
is given by

p(y(cid:63) | x(cid:63)  w(cid:63)  Y   X  W ) ≈

p(y(cid:63) | z(cid:63))

where x(cid:63) and w(cid:63) are object and feature vectors of object p(cid:63) and view q(cid:63) respectively  and we dropped
the dependency on parameters for notational compactness. The approximation in Eq. (12) is obtained
by replacing the exact posterior on Z with the variational distribution q(Z | Y ) (see Supplementary
Information for full details). From Eq. (12)  the mean of the GPPVAE predictive posterior can be
obtained by the following procedure: (i) encode training image data in the latent space through the
encoder  (ii) predict latent representation z(cid:63) of image y(cid:63) using the GP predictive posterior  and (iii)
decode latent representation z(cid:63) to the high-dimensional image space through the decoder.

4 Experiments

We focus on the task of making predictions of unseen images  given speciﬁed auxiliary information.
Speciﬁcally  we want to predict the image representation of object p in view q when that object was
never observed in that view  but assuming that object p was observed in at least one other view  and
that view had been observed for at least one other object. For example  we may want to predict the
pose of a person appearing in our training data set without having seen that person in that pose. To do
so  we need to have observed that pose for other people. This prediction task gets at the heart of what
we want our model to achieve  and therefore serves as a good evaluation metric.

4.1 Methods considered

In addition to the GPPVAE presented (GPPVAE-joint)  we also considered a version with a simpler
optimization scheme (GPPVAE-dis). We also considered two extensions of the VAE that can be used
for the task at hand. Speciﬁcally  we considered:

• GPPVAE with joint optimization (GPPVAE-joint)  where autoencoder and GP parame-
ters were optimized jointly. We found that convergence was improved by ﬁrst training the
encoder and the decoder through standard VAE  then optimizing the GP parameters with
ﬁxed encoder and decoder for 100 epochs  and ﬁnally  optimizing all parameters jointly. Out-
of-sample predictions from GPPVAE-joint were obtained by using the predictive posterior
in Eq. (12);
• GPPVAE with disjoint optimization (GPPVAE-dis)  where we ﬁrst learned the encoder
and decoder parameters through standard VAE  and then optimized the GP parameters with
ﬁxed encoder and decoder. Again  out-of-sample predictions were obtained by using the
predictive posterior in Eq. (12);
• Conditional VAE (CVAE) (Sohn et al.  2015)  where view auxiliary information was
provided as input to both the encoder and decoder networks (Figure S1  S2). After training 
we considered the following procedure to generate an image of object p in view q. First 
we computed latent representations of all the images of object p across all the views in the
training data (in this setting  CVAE latent representations are supposedly independent from
the view). Second  we averaged all the obtained latent representations to obtain a unique
representation of object p. Finally  we fed the latent representation of object p together with
out-of-sample view q to the CVAE decoder. As an alternative implementation  we also tried
to consider the latent representation of a random image of object p instead of averaging  but
the performance was worse–these results are not included;

6

• Linear Interpolation in VAE latent space (LIVAE)  which uses linear interpolation be-
tween observed views of an object in the latent space learned through standard VAE in
order to predict unobserved views of the same object. Speciﬁcally  denoting z1 and z2
as the latent representations of images of a given object in views r1 and r2  a prediction
for the image of that same object in an intermediate view  r(cid:63)  is obtained by ﬁrst linearly
interpolating between z1 and z2  and then projecting the interpolated latent representation
to the high-dimensional image space.

Consistent with the L2 reconstruction error appearing in the loss off all the aforementioned VAEs
(e. g.  Eq. (18))  we considered pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) as the evaluation metric. We
used the same architecture for encoder and decoder neural networks in all methods compared (see
Figure S1  S2 in Supplementary Information). The architecture and σ2
y  were chosen to minimize
the ELBO loss for the standard VAE on a validation set (Figure S3  Supplementary Information).
For CVAE and LIVAE  we also considered the alternative strategy of selecting the value of σ2
y that
maximizes out-of-sample prediction performance on the validation set (the results for these two
methods are in Figure S4 and S5). All models were trained using the Adam optimizer (Kingma and
Ba  2014) with standard parameters and a learning rate of 0.001. When optimizing GP parameters
with ﬁxed encoder and decoder  we observed that higher learning rates led to faster convergence
without any loss in performance  and thus we used a higher learning rate of 0.01 in this setting.

4.2 Rotated MNIST

Setup. We considered a variation of the MNIST dataset  consisting of rotated images of hand-
written "3" digits with different rotation angles. In this setup  objects correspond to different draws of
the digit "3" while views correspond to different rotation states. View features are observed scalars 
corresponding to the attached rotation angles. Conversely  object feature vectors are unobserved and
learned from data—no draw-speciﬁc features are available.

Dataset generation. We generated a dataset from 400 handwritten versions of the digit three by
rotating through Q = 16 evenly separated rotation angles in [0  2π)  for a total of N = 6  400
samples. We then kept 90% of the data for training and test  and the rest for validation. From the
training and test sets  we then randomly removed 25% of the images to consider the scenario of
incomplete data. Finally  the set that we used for out-of-sample predictions (test set) was created by
removing one of the views (i. e.  rotation angles) from the remaining images. This procedure resulted
in 4  050 training images spanning 15 rotation angles and 270 test images spanning one rotation
angle.

Autoencoder and GP model. We set the dimension of the latent space to L = 16. For encoder
and decoder neural networks we considered the convolutional architecture in Figure S1. As view
kernel  we considered a periodic squared exponential kernel taking rotation angles as inputs. As
object kernel  we considered a linear kernel taking the object feature vectors as inputs. As object
feature vectors are unobserved  we learned from data—their dimensionality was set to M = 8. The
resulting composite kernel K  expresses the covariance between images n and m in terms of the
corresponding rotations angles wqn and wqm and object feature vectors xpn and xpm as

Results. GPPVAE-joint and GPPVAE-dis yielded lower MSE than CVAE and LIVAE in the
interpolation task  with GPPVAE-joint performing signiﬁcantly better than GPPVAE-dis (0.0280 ±
0.0008 for GPVAE-joint vs 0.0306 ± 0.0009 for GPPVAE-dis  p < 0.02  Fig. 2a b). Importantly 
GPPVAE-joint learns different variational parameters than a standard VAE (Fig. 2c d)  used also by
GPPVAE-dis  consistent with the fact that GPPVAE-joint performs better by adapting the VAE latent
space using guidance from the prior.

4.3 Face dataset

Setup. As second application  we considered the Face-Place Database (3.0) (Righi et al.  2012) 
which contains images of people faces in different poses. In this setting  objects correspond to the
person identities while views correspond to different poses. Both view and object feature vectors are
unobserved and learned from data. The task is to predict images of people face in orientations that
remained unobserved.

Data. We considered 4 835 images from the Face-Place Database (3.0)  which includes images
of faces for 542 people shown across nine different poses (frontal and 90  60  45  30 degrees left
and right2). We randomly selected 80% of the data for training (n = 3  868)  10% for validation
(n = 484) and 10% for testing (n = 483). All images were rescaled to 128 × 128.

Autoencoder and GP model. We set the dimension of the latent space to L = 256. For encoder
and decoder neural networks we considered the convolutional architecture in Figure S2. We consider
a full-rank covariance as a view covariance (only nine poses are present in the dataset) and a linear
covariance for the object covariance (M = 64).

Results. GPPVAE-jointand GPPVAE-disyielded lower MSE than CVAE and LIVAE (Fig. 2a b).
In contrast to the MNIST problem  the difference between GPPVAE-joint andGPPVAE-dis was not
signiﬁcant (0.0281 ± 0.0008 for GPPVAE-joint vs 0.0298 ± 0.0008 for GPPVAE-dis). Importantly 
GPPVAE-joint was able to dissect people (object) and pose (view) covariances by learning people
and pose kernel jointly (Fig. 2a b).

5 Discussion

We introduced GPPVAE  a generative model that incorporates a GP prior over the latent space.
We also presented a low-memory and computationally efﬁcient inference strategy for this model 
which makes the model applicable to large high-dimensional datasets. GPPVAE outperforms natural
baselines (CVAE and linear interpolations in the VAE latent space) when predicting out-of-sample
test images of objects in speciﬁed views (e. g.  pose of a face  rotation of a digit). Possible future

2 We could have used the pose angles as view feature scalar similar to the application in rotated MNIST  but
purposely ignored these features to consider a more challenging setting were neither object and view features are
observed.

work includes augmenting the GPPVAE loss with a discriminator function  similar in spirit to a
GAN (Goodfellow et al.  2014)  or changing the loss to be perception-aware (Hou et al.  2017) (see
results from preliminary experiments in Figure S6). Another extension is to consider approximations
of the GP likelihood that fully factorize over data points (Hensman et al.  2013); this could further
improve the scalability of our method.
