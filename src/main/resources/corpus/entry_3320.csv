Abstract

Our understanding of the neural computations that underlie the ability of animals
to choose among options has advanced through a synthesis of computational mod-
eling  brain imaging and behavioral choice experiments. Yet  there remains a
gulf between theories of preference learning and accounts of the real  economic
choices that humans face in daily life  choices that are usually between some
amount of money and an item. In this paper  we develop a theory of magnitude-
sensitive preference learning that permits an agent to rationally infer its prefer-
ences for items compared with money options of different magnitudes. We show
how this theory yields classical and anomalous supply-demand curves and pre-
dicts choices for a large panel of risky lotteries. Accurate replications of such
phenomena without recourse to utility functions suggest that the theory proposed
is both psychologically realistic and econometrically viable.

Introduction

While value/utility is a useful abstraction for macroeconomic applications  it has little psychological
validity [1]. Valuations elicited in laboratory conditions are known to be extremely variable under
different elicitation conditions  liable to anchor on arbitrary observations  and extremely sensitive
to the set of options presented [2]. This last property constitutes the most straightforward refutation
of the existence of object-speciﬁc utilities. Consider for example  an experiment conducted by [3] 
where subjects were endowed with a ﬁxed amount of money  which they could use across multiple
trials to buy out of receiving an electric shock of one of three different magnitudes (see left panel
in Figure 1). The large systematic differences found in the prices for different shock magnitudes
that subjects in this study were willing to pay demonstrate the absence of any ﬁxed psychophysical
measurements of value. Thus  while utility maximization is a mathematically useful heuristic in
economic applications  it is unlikely that utility functions can represent value in any signiﬁcant
psychological sense.
Neurological studies also demonstrate the existence of neuron populations sensitive not to absolute
reward values  but to one of the presented options being better relative to the others  a phenomenon
called comparative coding. Comparative coding was ﬁrst reported in [4]  who observed activity in
the orbito-frontal neurons of monkeys when offered varying juice rewards presented in pairs within
separate trial blocks in patterns that depended only on whether a particular juice is preferred within
its trial. Elliott et al. [5] found similar results using fMRI in the medial orbitofrontal cortex of human
subjects a brain region known to be involved in value coding. Even more strikingly  Plassmann et
al [6] found that falsely assigning a high price to a particular item (wine) caused both greater self-
reported experienced pleasantness (EP) (see right panel of Figure 1) and greater mOFC activity
indicative of pleasure. What is causing this pleasure? Where is the ‘value’ assigned to the pricier
wine sample coming from?

Figure 1: Valuations of options elicited in the lab can be notoriously labile. Left: An experiment
where subjects had to pay to buy out of receiving electric shock saw subjects losing or gaining
value for the price of pain of particular magnitudes both as a function of the amount of money the
experimenters initially gave them and the relative magnitude of the pair of shock options they were
given experience with. Right: Subjects asked to rate ﬁve (actually three) wines rated artiﬁcially
highly-priced samples of wine as more preferable. Not only this  imaging data from orbitofrontal
cortex showed that they actually experienced these samples as more pleasurable.

Viewed in light of these various difﬁculties  making choices for options that involve magnitudes 
appears to be a formidable challenge. However humans  and even animals [7] are well-known to
perform such operations easily. Therefore  one of two possibilities holds: one  that it is possible 
notwithstanding the evidence laid out above  for humans to directly assess value magnitudes (except
in corner cases like the ones we describe); two  that some alternative set of computations permits
them to behave as if they can estimate value magnitudes. This paper formalizes the set of computa-
tions that operationalizes this second view.
We build upon a framework of preference learning proposed in [8] that avoids the necessity for
assuming psychophysical access to value and develop a model that can form preferences for quan-
tities of objects directly from history of past choices. Since the most common modality of choices
involving quantities in the modern world is determining the prices of objects  pricing forms the pri-
mary focus of our experiments. Speciﬁcally  we derive from our theory (i) classical and anomalous
supply-demand curves  and (ii) choice predictions for a large panel of risky lotteries. Hence  in this
paper we present a theory of magnitude-sensitive preference formation that  as an important special
case  provides an account of how humans learn to value money.

2 Learning to value magnitudes

2.1 Rational preference formation

Traditional treatments of preference learning (e.g. [9]) assume that there is some hidden state func-
tion U : X → R+ such that x (cid:31) x(cid:48) iff U (x) > U (x(cid:48)) ∀x(cid:48) ∈ X   where X is the set of all possible op-
tions. Preference learning  in such settings  is reduced to a task of statistically estimating a monotone
distortion of U  thereby making two implicit assumptions (i) that there exists some psychophysical
apparatus that can compute hedonic utilities and (ii) that there exists some psychophysical apparatus
capable of representing absolute magnitudes capable of comparison in the mind. The data we de-
scribe above argues against either possibility being true. In order to develop a theory of preference
formation that avoids commitments to psychophysical value estimation  a novel approach is needed.
Srivastava & Schrater [8] provide us with the building blocks for such an approach. They pro-
pose that the process of learning preferences can be modeled as an ideal Bayesian observer directly
learning ‘which option among the ones offered is best’  retaining memory of which options were
presented to it at every choice instance. However  instead of directly remembering option sets  their
model allows for the possibility that option set observations map to latent contexts in memory. In
practice  this mapping is assumed to be identiﬁed in all their demonstrations. Formally  the com-
putation corresponding to utility in this framework is p(r|x  o)  which is obtained by marginalizing

where it is understood that the context probability p(c|o) = p(c|{o1  o2 ···   ot−1}) is a distribution
on the set of all possible contexts incrementally inferred from the agent’s observation history. Here 
p(r|x  c) encodes the probability that the item x was preferred to all other items present in choice in-
stances linked with the context c  p(x|c) encodes the probability that the item x was present in choice
sets indexed by the context c and p(c) encodes the frequency with which the observer encounters
these contexts.
The observer also continually updates p(c|o) via recursive Bayesian estimation 

p(c(t)|o(1:t)) =

(cid:80)C

which  in conjunction with the desirability based state preference update  and a simple decision rule
(e.g. MAP  softmax) yields a complete decision theory.
While this theory is complete in the formal sense that it can make testable predictions of options
chosen in the future given options chosen in the past  it is incomplete in its ability to represent
options: it will treat a gamble that pays $20 with probability 0.1 against safely receiving $1 and
one that pays $20000 with probability 0.1 against safely receiving $1 as equivalent  which is clearly
unsatisfactory. This is because it considers only simple cases where options have nominal labels.
We now augment it to take the information that magnitude labels1 provide into account.

2.2 Magnitude-sensitive preference formation
Typically  people will encounter monetary labels m ∈ M in a large number of contexts  often en-
tirely outside the purview of the immediate choice to be made. In the theory of [8] incorporating
desirability information related to m will involve marginalizing across all these contexts. Since
the set of such contexts across a person’s entire observation history is larg  explicit marginaliza-
tion across all contexts would imply explicit marginalization across every observation involving the
monetary label m  which is unrealistic. Thus information about contexts must be compressed or
summarized2.
We can resolve this by assuming that instead that animals generate contexts as clusters of observa-
tions  thereby creating the possibility of learning higher-order abstract relationships between them.
Such models of categorization via clustering are widely accepted in cognitive psychology [10].
Now  instead of recalling all possible observations containing m  an animal with a set of observation
clusters (contexts) would simply sample a subset of these that would be representative of all con-
texts wherein observations containing m are statistically typical. In such a setting  p(m|c) would
correspond to the observation likelihood of the label m being seen in the cluster c  p(c) would cor-
respond to the relative frequency of context occurrences  and p(r|x  m  c) would correspond to the
inferred value for item x when compared against monetary label m while the active context c. The
remaining probability term p(x|m) encodes the probability of seeing transactions involving item x
and the particular monetary label m. We deﬁne r to take the value 1 when x (cid:31) x(cid:48)∀x(cid:48) ∈ X − {x}.
Following a similar probabilistic calculus as in Equation 1  the inferred value of x becomes p(r|x)
and can be calculated as 

(cid:80)M

p(r|x) =

1Note that taking monetary labels into account is not the same as committing to a direct psychophysical
evaluation of money. In our account  value judgments are linked not with magnitudes  but with labels  that just
happen to correspond to numbers in common practice.
2Mechanistic considerations of neurobiology also suggest sparse sampling of prior contexts. The memory
and computational burden of recalculating preferences for an ever-increasing C would quickly prove insupera-
ble.

diate probability terms in our proposed model would operationalize different forms of information
needed to solve such a problem (right). Marginalizing across situation contexts and magnitude labels
tells us what the animal will do.

with the difference from the earlier expression arising from an additional summation over the set M
of monetary labels that the agent has experience with.
Figure 2 illustrates how these computations could be practically instantiated in a general situation
involving magnitude-sensitive value inference that animals could face. Our hunter-gatherer ancestor
has to choose which berry bush to forage in  and we must infer the choice he will make based on
recorded history of his past behavior. The right panel in this ﬁgure illustrates natural interpretations
for the intermediate conditional probabilities in Equation 3. The term p(m|c) encodes prior under-
standing of the fertility differential in the soils that characterize each of the three active contexts.
The p(r|x  m  c) term records the history of the forager’s choice within the context in via empiri-
cally observed relative frequencies. What drives the forager to prefer a sparsely-laden tree on the
hill instead of the densely laden tree in the forest in our example  though  is his calculation of the
underlying context probability p(c). In our story  because he lives near the hill  he encounters the
bushes on the hill more frequently  and so they dominate his preference judgment. A wide palette
of possible behaviors can be similarly interpreted and rationalized within the framework we have
outlined.
What exactly is this model telling us though that we aren’t putting into it ourselves? The only strong
constraint it imposes on the form of preferences currently is that they will exhibit context-speciﬁc
consistency  viz. an animal that prefers one option over another in a particular context will continue
to do so in future trials. While this constraint itself is only valid if we have some way of pinning
down particular contexts  it is congruent with results from marketing research that describe the
general form of human preferences as being ‘ arbitrarily coherent’ - consumer preferences are labile
and sensitive to changes in option sets  framing effects  loss aversion and a host of other treatments
but are longitudinally reliable within these treatments [2]. For our model to make more interesting
economic predictions  we must further constrain the form of the preferences it can emit to match
those seen in typical monetary transactions; we do this by making further assumptions about the
intermediate terms in Equation 3 in the next three sections that describe economic applications.

3 Living in a world of money

Equation 3 gives us predictions about how people will form preferences for various options that
co-occur with money labels. Here we specialize this model to make predictions about the value of
options that are money labels  viz. ﬁat currency. The institutional imperatives of legal tender im-
pose a natural ordering on preferences involving monetary quantities. Ceteris paribus  subjects will
prefer a larger quantity of money to a smaller quantity of money. Thus  while the psychological de-

before.

reﬂecting strong dependence on the shape of p(m)  the empirical distribution of monetary outcomes
in the world.
What can we say about the shape of the general frequency distribution of numbers in the world?
Numbers have historically arisen as ways to quantify  which helps plan resource foraging  consump-
tion and conservation. Scarcity of essential resources naturally makes being able to differentiate
small magnitudes important for selection ﬁtness. This motivates the development of number sys-
tems where objects counted frequently (essential resources) are counted with small numbers (for
better discriminability). Thus  it is reasonable to assume that  in general  larger numbers will be
encountered relatively less frequently than smaller ones in natural environments  and hence  that the
functions p(m) and p(c) will be monotone decreasing3. For analytical tractability  we formalize this
assumption by setting p(m|c) to be gamma distributed on the domain of monetary labels  and p(c)
to be an exponential distribution on the domain of the typical ‘wealth’ rate of individual contexts.
The wealth rate is an empirically accessible index for the set of situation contexts  and represents
the typical (average) monetary label we expect to see in observations associated with this context.
Thus  for instance  the wealth rate for ‘steakhouses’ will be higher than that of ‘fast food’. For
any particular value of the wealth rate  the ‘price’ distribution p(m|c) will reﬂect the relative fre-
quencies of seeing various monetary labels in the world in observations typical to context c. The
gamma/log-normal shape of real-world prices in speciﬁc contexts is well-attested empirically. The
wealth rate distribution p(c) can be always made monotone decreasing simply by shufﬂing the order
of presentation of contexts in the measure of the distribution.
With these distributional assumptions  the marginalized product p(m) is assured to be a Pareto
distribution. Data from [12] as well as supporting indirect observations in [13]  suggest that we are
on relatively safe ground by making such assumptions for the general distribution of monetary units
in the world [14]. This set of assumptions further reduces Equation 7 to 

where ψ(·) is the Pareto c.d.f.

p(r|x) = ψ(xm∗ ) 

(8)

3Convergent evidence may also be found in the Zipﬁan principle of communication efﬁciency [11]. While it
might appear incongruous to speak of differential efﬁciency in communicating numbers  recall that the histor-
ical origins of numbers involved tally marks and other explicit token-based representations of numbers which
imposed increasing resource costs in representing larger numbers.

Reduced experience with monetary options will be reﬂected in a reduced membership of M. Sam-
pling at random from M corresponds to approximating ψ with a limited number of samples. So long
as the sampling procedure is not systematically biased away from particular x values  the resulting
curve will not be qualitatively different from the true one. Systematic differences will arise  though 
if the sampling is biased by  say  the range of values observers are known to encounter. For instance 
it is reasonable to assume that the wealth of a person is directly correlated with the upper limit of
money values they will see. Substituting this upper limit in Equation 7  we obtain a systematic differ-
ence in the curvature of the utility function that subjects with different wealth endowments will have
for the same monetary labels. The trend we obtain from a simulation (see gray inset in Figure 3) with
three different wealth levels ($1000  $10000 and $ 1 million) matches the empirically documented
increase in relative risk aversion (curvature of the utility function) with wealth [15]. Observe that
the log concavity of the Pareto c.d.f. has the practical effect of essentially converting our inferred
value for money into a classical utility function. Thus  using two assumptions (number ordering and
scarcity of essential resources)  we have situated economic measurements of preference as a special 
ﬁxed case of a more general dynamic process of desirability evaluation.

4 Modeling willingness-to-pay

Figure 3: Illustrating derivations of pricing theory predictions for goods of various kinds from our
model.

Having studied how our model works for choices between items that all have money labels  the
logical next step is to study choices involving one item with a money label and one without  i.e. 
pricing. Note that asking how much someone values an option  as we did in the section above  is
different from asking if they would be willing to buy it at a particular price. The former corresponds
to the term p(r|x)  as deﬁned above. The latter will correspond to p(m|r  x)  with m being the price
the subject is willing to pay to complete the transaction. Since the contribution of all terms where
r = 0  i.e. the transaction is not completed  is identically zero this term can be computed as 

(cid:80)C p(x|m)p(m|c)p(c)

further replacing the integral over M with an integral over the real line as in Equation 5 for analytical
tractability when necessary.
What aspects of pricing behavior in the real world can our model explain? Interesting variations
in pricing arise from assumptions about the money distribution p(m|c) and/or the price distribu-
tion p(x|m). Figure 3 illustrates our model’s explanation for three prominent variations of classical

Consumers typically reduce prefer-
ence for goods when prices rise  and increases it when prices drop. This fact about the structure of
preferences involved in money transactions is replicated in our model (see ﬁrst column in Figure
3) via the reduction/increase of the contribution of the p(m|c) term to the numerator of Equation 9.
Marketing research reports anomalous pricing curves that violate this behavior in some cases. One
important case comprises of Veblen goods  wherein the demand for high-priced exclusive goods
drops when prices are lowered. Our model explains this behavior (see second column in Figure 3)
via unfamiliarity with the price reﬂected in a lower contribution from the price distribution p(x|m)
for such low values. Such non-monotonic preference behavior is difﬁcult for utility-based models 
but sits comfortably within ours  where familiarity with options at typical price points drives de-
sirability. Another category of anomalous demand curves comes from Giffen goods  which rise in
demand upon price increases because another substitute item becomes too expensive. Our approach
accounts for this behavior (see third column in Figure 3) under the assumption that price changes
affect the Giffen good less because its price distribution has a larger variance  which is in line with
empirical reports showing greater price inelasticity of Giffen goods [16].
The last column in Figure 3 addresses an aspect of the temporal dynamics of our model that po-
tentially explains both (i) why behavioral economists can continually ﬁnd new anchoring results
(e.g. [6  2]) and (ii) why classical economists often consider such results to be marginal and unin-
teresting [17]. Behavioral scientists running experiments in labs ask subjects to exhibit preferences
for which they may not have well-formed price and label distributions  which causes them to an-
chor and show other forms of preference instability. Economists fail to ﬁnd similar results in their
ﬁeld studies  because they collect data from subjects operating in contexts for which their price and
label distributions are well-formed. Both conclusions fall out of our model of sequential prefer-
ence learning  where initial samples can bias the posterior  but the long-run distribution remains
stable. Parenthetically  this demonstration also renders transparent the mechanisms by which con-
sumers process rapid inﬂationary episodes  stock price volatility  and transferring between multiple
currency bases. In all these cases  empirical observations suggests inertia followed by adaptation 
which is precisely what our model would predict.

5 Modeling risky monetary choices

Finally  we ask: how well can our model ﬁt the choice behavior of real humans making economic
decisions? The simplest economic setup to perform such a test is in predicting choices between
risky lotteries  since the human prediction is always treated as a stochastic choice preference that
maps directly onto the output of our model. We use a basic expected utility calculation  where the
desirability for lottery options is computed as in Equation 8. For a choice between a risky lottery
x1 = {mh  ml} and a safe choice x2 = ms  with a win probability q and where mh > ms > ml 
the value calculation for the risky option will take the form

where ψ(·) is the c.d.f. of the Pareto distribution on monetary labels m and p(x) is the given lottery
probability.
Using Equation 12  where ψ is the c.d.f of a Pareto distribution  (θ = {2.9  0.1  1} ﬁtted empiri-
cally)  assuming that subjects distort perceived probabilities [18] via an inverse-S shaped weighting
function4  and using an -random utility maximization decision rule5  we obtain choice predictions

agent population. The quantitative values for γ are taken from (Zhang & Maloney  2012).

5-random decision utility maximization is a simple way of introducing stochasticity into the decision rule 
and is a common econometric practice when modeling population-level data. It predicts that subjects pick the
option with higher computed expected utility with a probability 1 −   and predict randomly with a probability

that match human performance (see Figure 4) on a large and comprehensive panel of risky choice
experiments obtained from [19] to within statistical conﬁdence6.

6 Conclusion

The idea that preferences about options can be directly determined psychophysically is strongly
embedded in traditional computational treatments of human preferences  e.g. reinforcement learn-
ing [20]. Considerable evidence  some of which we have discussed  suggests that the brain does
not in fact  compute value [3]. In search of a viable alternative  we have demonstrated a variety of
behaviors typical of value-based theories using a stochastic latent variable model that simply tracks
the frequency with which options are seen to be preferred in latent contexts and then compiles this
evidence in a rational Bayesian manner to emit preferences. This proposal  and its success in explain-
ing fundamental economic concepts  situates the computation of value (as it is generally measured)
within the range of abilities of neural architectures that can only represent relative frequencies  not
absolute magnitudes.
While our demonstrations are computationally simple  they are substantially novel. In fact  com-
putational models explaining any of these effects even in isolation are difﬁcult to ﬁnd [1]. While
the results we demonstrate are preliminary  and while some of the radical implications of our pre-
dictions about the effects of choice history on preferences (“you will hesitate in buying a Macbook
for $100 because that is an unfamiliar price for it”7) remain to be veriﬁed  the plain ability to de-
scribe these economic concepts within an inductively rational framework without having to invoke
a psychophysical value construct by itself constitutes a non-trival success and forms the essential
contribution of this work.

the data. Since we are computing risk attitudes over a population  we should ideally also model stochasticity in
utility computatation.

6While [19] do not give standard deviations for their data  we assume that binary choice probabilities can be
modeled by a binomial distribution  which gives us a theoretical estimate for the standard deviation expected in
the data. Our optimal ﬁts lie within 1 SD of the raw data for 34 of 35 payoff-probability combinations  yielding
a ﬁt in probability.
